I have an internet acquaintance that I’ve been following on social media for a little over two years now, an all-around nice, smart girl who blogs and does odd jobs and has recently decided to go back and get a Master’s. In Europe. For a degree that, by all reasonable accounts, is probably not going to lead to a great job. And she knows this, I think, because she talks about it as “an opportunity to learn and expand her mind,” more than any sort of preparation for a future career. Which is fine, but the truth of the matter is that she is able to enjoy such freedom — to be a wanderer of sorts who enjoys travel, study for the sake of study, and long conversations over good dinners — because she comes from a good bit of wealth and, if not subsidized entirely, never has to worry about her safety net. She won that particular bit of genetic lottery, and it’s useless to begrudge her the freedom that fate bestowed on her.But it It’s a way for the upper classes to pat themselves on the back for being able to do something that, quite literally, anyone with money can buy. Traveling for the sake of travel is not an achievement, nor is it guaranteed to make anyone a more cultured, nuanced person. (Some of the most dreadful, entitled tourists are the same people who can afford to visit three new countries each year.) But someone who has had the extreme privilege (yes, privilege) of getting out there and traveling extensively while young is not any better, wiser, or more worthy than the person who has stayed home to work multiple jobs to get the I was able to travel, and even though I paid for my life abroad with my own work, it was still a result of a healthy amount of privilege. I was from a middle-class family who I did not need to support or help financially, I knew that I could always slink back to their couch if things didn’t work out, and I had managed to accrue a bit of savings while living at home for the few months before I left. There are millions of people who have none of these things, and even if they wanted to pay for travel on their own, would simply not be able to because of the responsibility or poverty they lived with. For even my modest ability to see the world, I am eternally grateful.And what’s more, I understand (perhaps even better after having traveled a good amount) that nothing about your ability or inability to travel means anything about you as a person. Some people are simply saddled with more responsibilities and commitments, and less disposable income, whether from birth or not. And someone needing to stay at a job they may not love because they have a family to take care of, or college to pay for, or basic financial independence to achieve, does not mean that they don’t have the same desire to learn and grow as someone who travels. They simply do not have the same options, and are learning and growing in their own way, in the context of the life they have. They are learning what it means to work hard, to delay gratification, and to better yourself in slow, small ways. This may not be a backpacking trip around Eastern Europe, but it would be hard to argue that it builds any less character.Encouraging that person to “not worry about money,” or to “drop everything and follow their dreams,” demonstrates only a profound misunderstanding about what “worrying” actually means. What the condescending traveler means by “not worrying” is “not making it a priority, or giving it too much weight in your life,” because on some level they imagine you are choosing an extra dollar over an all-important Experience. But the “worrying” that is actually going on is the knowledge that you have no choice Everyone needs to forge their own path to financial independence and freedom. And perhaps you are lucky enough that your path involves a lot of wandering around, taking your time, and trying a bunch of new things — because you know that security will be waiting for you at the end of the rainbow. That’s fine, and there is no need to feel guilt or shame over your privilege, if only because it’s unproductive and helps no one. But to encourage people to follow your very rare path, because you feel it is the only way to spiritual enlightenment or meaning, makes you an asshole. It makes you the person who posts vapid “inspirational” quotes that only apply to a tiny percent of the population who already has all the basics covered.

It was ……Incredible.It was literally life changing.Well, we didn’t want to do the traditional Barticklestan tourist thing, you know? It’s like, okay, how many times have we all seen the Enshrined Statue of Gordiblaschitan on Mount Frijibadibad on like, every post card from World Market?Where to start! The food, oh the food! We dined on the finest goat gonads and participated in the annual Frigfuckerschtick Festival where they leave milk out in the sun and then once it ferments they make it into this milk relish type stuff? Anyways you put the sour milk chunks on the gonads, and OMG it melts in your mouth.Honestly, I thought about just staying there and leaving all of this Well they’ve been caught up in this 63-year civil war that’s sort of complicated things, but mostly that just affected the refugees, you know? Like, no one bothered me, everyone was like really nice and like, asked me about my blonde hair — like I was like a celebrity! Ha. Ha.Anways, yeahhhhh, they just prioritize the things that matter because they’re so POOR. And POOR PEOPLE are so wise. And being there, it just reminds me how disgustingly consumerist we all are. (Takes sip from Starbucks cup.) I mean, honest to God I’m planning on moving there. Don’t tell anyone. But I am.Oh yeah, totally. I’m like, searching for jobs over there, but it’s kind of hard because it’s like you have to have a male attendant with you at all times. So I’m like, oh, so like, for a social media specialist position, too…? Anyways, I’ve got some things to work out for sure. But it’s totally worth it because I just can’t stand it here.Yeah, I mean, I just want to live somewhere where it’s like, you don’t have to worry about the mortgage and what to wear to the club and stuff, it’s like all those people can do is think about where the insurgents are lately and what to eat. That kind of life is so much simpler.I guess.You just don’t get it. Have you BEEN to Barticklestan??Yeah, see. You wouldn’t understand. You just have to go there to know what I’m talking about.It was …… IncrediblePeople water down my writing at the ol’ day job. Guess who gets to see the real me? You lucky folks.Here there is hope, humor, and help as you deepen your connection to others, yourself, and to your work.

The concept invaded my consciousness as only an insidious radio advert can.I was on a South London bus, headphones firmly implanted to drown out the school-kids’ Friday morning hullabaloo, when amongst the usual litany of shouty commercials came the sound of waves and seagulls.A soothing voiceover inquired: “Why be Andy Nuttall when you can be…” and suddenly there arose the voice of Andy himself, assaulting my eardrums in a strangled underwater scream that proclaimed his name in affirmatory joy: “…A-N-D-Y N-U-T-T-A-L-L?!?”Then came that slogan: “Travel yourself interesting,” and here was the rub — the once tedious Mr. Nuttall had been injected with an ebullient charisma by way of a simple trip abroad.As I pondered this seductive message, part of a tongue-in-cheek promotional campaign by internet travel company Expedia, one question nagged: if travel makes you interesting, why are so many ‘travellers’ such a bore?Anyone who’s spent a fair amount of time in the world’s hostel dormitories will have met the culprit. He sits there on the bottom bunk, emaciated tanned limbs protruding from a Bintang vest and a pair of baggy pyjama trousers printed with a flailing dragon, and then he starts to witter. Whether you like it or not, you are hearing his story, each twist in the narrative prefaced by the dread-refrain: “when I was in…”He’s been away for two months, spent most of it dancing on the beach addled on diet pills and Sangsom sets—perhaps punctuated by a week of hungover volunteering building a retaining wall that is destined to collapse within a year. His destination’s merits can all be surmised with the brain-dead epithet “amazing”; the natives were “so friendly”. But this facsimile, off-the-peg experience has invested him with unprecedented insight into Thailand’s society—indeed, into the very essence of the human condition. Suddenly, he is Marco Polo returning from the court of Kublai Khan. He must write a blog, post endless photos on social media. Everyone must benefit from his remarkable new wisdom!This idea that travelling is an essential ingredient of a life well-lived is still in its infancy. Fifty years ago, as granny and granddad holidayed in Eastbourne, sheltering from the drizzle with bingo and haddock and chips on the pier, the experienced traveller was a storied soul, a seeker possessed of genuinely unusual knowledge. Only as the baby boomers came of age did the foreign holiday enter the quotidian. Not until the 90s did going to more exotic climes—the ubiquitous ‘gap-year’—become a post-secondary school, middle-class rite of passage.In the years since, this idea has seeped into the West’s worldview. But somewhere amidst the collision of widening global curiosity, runaway self-absorption and increasingly unputdownable technology lurks a sense that travel is losing its capacity to make us wonder.The internet, that great reductive slag-heap of YOLO hashtags in the sky, has been one of the main instigators of this phenomenon. Walk into a hostel bar nowadays and look around — chances are that half the patrons will be ensconced in their digital worlds. Expressionless faces illuminated by the deadening LCD glare of tablet screens, they sit around plugged into the home they had intended to leave behind, able to research every flight, hotel and restaurant in advance based on countless peer reviews.With the arrival of Google Glass, shameless self-obsessives everywhere will soon be able to access travel information by conversing with a pair of spectacles: “OK, Glass,” we’ll say (for that is how you awaken the ocular gadget), “please go ahead and expunge any last shred of motivation I might have to rely on the kindness of strangers and hand me everything on a screen beamed directly into my jaundiced fucking eyeballs!”By shrinking the world, the tyranny of the web has stifled our capacity for independent discovery, catering to an appetite for foreknowledge that inevitably demystifies foreign places. Instead of taking time to absorb and consider, many people seem more inclined to travel quickly, tick off the ‘don’t miss’ highlights and form broad-brush assumptions based on the bare minimum of immersion. Yet the axiom that all ‘travel’ (as opposed to tourism) is by definition enriching and transformative persists.Except it’s not. Not always. Going on an overland truck tour through Tanzania, travelling with people from your own country, from your own demographic, on the same prescribed routes, stopping only to point at animals and get leathered in westernized hostels does not make you an authority on all that ails post-independence Africa.Perhaps Andy Nuttall’s story of his encounter with some clown fish off the coast of Sharm el-Sheikh will electrify the Home Counties, transforming his previously leaden dinner-table repartee into that of Peter Ustinov. More likely, he’ll bore everyone to the brink of violence with anecdotes we’ve heard before—of kebabs and camel-rides, and the hilarious severity of his diarrhea.In part, our impatience with dullards like Andy blowing on their travel trumpets is born of envy—who, after all, wants to hear about someone else’s hedonism while their own six months of life has evaporated in a barely remembered routine of workplace drudgery and binge-drinking? But it’s also the solipsistic delusion implied by his belief that his story is worth relating—the automatic assumption that HIS experiences hold some inherent value to EVERYONE ELSE.Travel has become another exercise in narcissistic presentation, one more way of desperately extracting some semblance of uniqueness out of your otherwise soul-crushingly mediocre existence.It’s as though we’ve lost sight of the fact that it’s not what you experience, but how you perceive it. The apocryphal cosmic adventurer who lived an entire imagined lifetime inside an orange after necking ayahuasca—that’s the fellow I want around my dinner table, not some dunce who’s Eaten, Prayed and Loved their way through a week-long wellness retreat in Rishikesh, but had already decided upon the myriad ways the journey would alter their worldview before they’d stepped off the Shatabdi Express.This stance is part-confession. I’m a travel writer, which is short-hand for saying that I’m a workshy dilettante with an over-inflated respect for the unique value of my own experience. What started as a means of investing my inveterate wanderings with more purpose has become an exercise in ego-massage, and a burden: each turn in the road reconnoitred in advance, the camera never far from my side.The life my stories project has little basis in my daily reality. For each hour I spend scribbling notes in some remote Shangri-la, I spend twenty more hunkered in a spine-degrading keyboard hunch, hammering out articles that only contribute to the problem, exhorting people to visit places that may well be better off without them, all the while wondering whether it might provoke the sort of fan-mail I received for recent travel stories, which moved one reader to brand me “a deluded c*nt.”And, in moments of honesty, I know that I may never recapture the “first pill” magic of my earliest independent trips abroad: the naïve kid in a Bintang vest and dragon trousers perpetually rudderless in Asia, without a guidebook, mobile phone or map to steer me.Look, I’m not saying that certain types of travel are without value. Get away, get some sun, write a journal, prostrate yourself before the altar of benumbing technology and record every step of your journey on social media if it makes you feel better about yourself. Just realize: if your travelling is a box-ticking exercise; if you predicate even one iota of self-worth on how many countries you’ve visited; if you think in bucket-lists inspired by clickbait ‘10 best’ listicles appealing to the lowest common denominator, from one deluded c*nt to another, travelling isn’t making you interesting. It’s just confirming your position as one of the crowd.Years ago, I bumped into a Canadian couple in Patagonia whose every step had been pursued by serendipity. They’d arrived in the Los Glaciares National Park on the day the ice-bridge calved off the Perito Moreno glacier—a once in a decade event. On the Valdes Peninsula, they’d witnessed a procession of killer whales beaching themselves to hunt for baby sea-lions from the very same windswept promontory where, two weeks earlier, I’d stood for six hours without seeing so much as a fin. And how did they articulate their astonishing good fortune?“It was pretty awesome,” the man shrugged in a monotone drawl.And if that’s the sum total of your response to the world’s wonder, I’m sorry, but a little bit of travel is never going to save you.Travel features and assorted ramblings for over 60 publications, inc.

Even before I took up my writing career again The most important words to jot down are the details you can’t Google. How it feels like to visit that particular restaurant, what the main course smelled like or how the waiter ended up with that scar on his upper lip. The goal is to collect something that not everyone (actually only the people that visited the exact same spot as you) knows.Why should you go through the effort to take notes? The most obvious reason is that it could earn you money when you’re back home.How come? The thing is, it’s usually a lot easier to sell your photos if you’re able to package it together with a text. But don’t think for a second that it’s just about writing a few paragraphs and believe that it will sell your photos. There are as many writers wanting to become travel journalists as there are photographers dreaming about making a living from shooting travel photos. You need to be good at writing too! It doesn’t have to be thousands and thousands of words though, but good writing. Flip through any travel magazine and you’ll realize that the lengths varies.Even if you don’t plan on taking up journalism when you get back home, the act of note-taking will give you a much greater travel experience! Picking up your notebook and spending a few minutes now and then, jotting down what is happening around you, will make you more aware. Suddenly, you realize what the surroundings offer vastly more than you first thought.You start to notice the colors of the walls and the sounds from the kitchen. You start to smell the food in front of you before taking the first bite, just to be able to figure out a way to describe it in words. The details of the people around you, even the colors of their eyes, will become targets for your interest.You just can’t take too many notes. In the beginning I remember thinking that “I’ll remember that” or “I’ll look through the photos to find out what it looked like”. But two weeks later, after countless of new meetings (and as many glasses of wine), details will become blurry and forgotten. And even if you know beforehand that you will write an article about one specific topic and are collecting snippets of facts for that, what if you later get the opportunity to write another piece about that topic and you lack the information and notes?Here’s a few things that will help you get started.What you see is the most obvious and usually the easiest. But don’t just take note of the big picture, make sure to go into extreme details: The pieces of paint falling from the wall, the tiny bug hiking over the table cloth or the police man’s crow’s feet. These are the details that will blow life in a travel essay and make the reader feel like she is there with you.When you’ve written down everything you see, spend a short while identifying what kind of smells you find around you. Don’t just note “grilled chicken”, that is too vague. Don’t write WHAT you smell, write HOW it smells. Maybe “the oily smell from the chicken mixed with the dense fumes from the cars and the smoke from the coal — from time to time the fruity cologne of the chef manage to break through the heavy smells”. Be THAT specific.Then do the same for what you can taste. What you can touch. What you can hear. Go through all the senses, one after another.A crappy travel article is missing the same thing as crappy travel photos: Intimate meetings with people. Make sure you jot down loads of quotes from different people and get background information about the humans you talk to. This will not only help you remember what someone said for later, it will also make you extremely present WHEN talking, something that is very rare these days.When you have written down what they have said, it is important to also write down how they said it. Was he shaking his head? Was his eye twitching? What kind of accent did he have? High or low pitch? Was he speaking quicker when he got excited during certain parts of the conversation? How did he move his arms and hands?If you are going on a press-trip, the company arranging your trip usually wants you to see as much as possible in as few days as possible. It could get pretty hectic. So, it is extremely important to take note of where you are and what route you take.But even if you are traveling at a slower pace, make it a reflex to write down where you are and take a photo of that spread in your notebook whenever you arrive at a new place. That way you will know exactly where each photo was taken.For me, stopping for a while to write keywords and descriptions is almost meditative. I helps me to resist the urge to rush off to the next town or museum (that’s a bad example, I get really bored in museums). I will be able to travel fully at my current destination. To dig deeper and appreciate even the tiny fragments that everyone else misses.Now, go out and buy a really nice notebook and pen and start realizing and remembering!Follow me on Jens Lennartsson: Travel photographer, minimalist.

A quick collection of notes and tips that made my trip to Japan a lot easier.Having just returned from a two week vacation in Japan, I kept some notes on a few small tips that I picked up throughout my trip to make my journey as convenient and foolproof as possible.As someone who is directionally challenged and who had never spoken a word of Japanese before my trip, I knew I was going to need some help from Google Maps and Google Translate. Below are some tips about transportation, eating, and etiquette.Google Maps is an absolute lifesaver when it comes to navigating the Tokyo subway system.You’ll want to have Wi-Fi turned on (not connected, just on) so Google Maps can accurately determine your location. An explanation on how that works is If you already know of some of the places you’ll be visiting, it’s a good idea to click the “save” button on all of them. It makes Google Maps recall that location much faster without you having to fully re-type it.I The route overviews will give you a breakdown of walking time versus vehicle time. Make sure you’re not walking 21 minutes to a train station to ride a train for 3 minutes when you could just be walking 25 minutes to your destination.One of the most common questions I see people asking about traveling to Japan is: “does it make sense for me to buy a JR pass?”. Since the answer to that is covered extensively online, I’m not going to address it in this post.If you do decide to purchase a JR pass, you can purchase a “coupon” in the states ahead of time and redeem it at an “information” booth in Shinjuku and Tokyo station. If you’re using a JR pass, here’s what you should know about taking the Shinkansen (high-speed trains):If you’re using a JR pass, be sure to uncheck the “NOZOMI/MIZUHO” lines— your JR pass won’t work for those trains. Don’t worry though, the Hikari line is just as fast.If you’re traveling far on a bullet train, the only two boxes you need to check under the Also, try to keep track of which subway exits are closest to your destination if you plan on traveling through that station often. Metro and JR stations can be huge and have dozens of exists that are blocks away from each other. Exiting north when you need to be heading south could cost you 20 minutes in travel time. Each exit has a number, so try to keep track of which ones to use.One trick I used to prevent myself from missing my stop was using the built in “Reminders” app on iOS. It’s easy to wear headphones and miss announcements about which stop is next, especially on long train rides. You can use the reminders app to set location based alarms that will go off as you’re approaching your stop.One of the most daunting things about going out to eat for the first time in Japan is that everything is (obviously) in Japanese. And you can’t just punch those characters into Google Translate (unless for some reason you know how to do that), so the first few minutes of looking at your menu can be overwhelming. Here’s my advice:1. Ask for an English menu. I was surprised at how many places had them.2. If they don’t have an English menu, you can try to use the photograph translate button on the Google Translate app. It worked great for me, as long as the text was a consistent size and color. 3. If the restaurant you want to eat at has a display of plastic food outside, you can always take a picture of whichever food items you’d like to order and show it to your waiter/waitress.4. Yelp seems to have more accurate addresses for restaurants, even though it’s not commonly used in Japan. When finding a restaurant, I often search for the restaurant in Yelp, copy the address, and then paste it into Google Maps. Searching for restaurants by name on Google Maps can be extremely flaky and doesn’t do a good job of limiting results to places that are nearby.5. Read a few I’m going to sound a bit like your mom here, but manners and respect are very important in Japan. Don’t give American tourists a bad reputation by not following Japanese conventions.In case you’re interested, there’s a more complete etiquette guide I hope these tips and help make your visit to Japan a bit easier! It was such a wonderful experience to see the grand temples, museums, and parks and eat some of the best food in the world.

(via Most young people get the silly urge to travel.It usually kicks in sometime during their twenties.Resist. Don’t do it.Trust me.Don’t travel — especially to a foreign country.It will ruin your life.Because travel has a way of messing with you and you’re too impressionable in your twenties. Wait until your thirties or forties or fifties or later because most people are set in their ways by then.But in your twenties? No way. You’re just asking for misery and heartache.Have you ever twirled around in circles and then suddenly started twirling the other direction — it makes you feel sick and dizzy, right? That’s exactly how your entire world will feel once you travel.But I fear that many of you are too stubborn to heed my warnings.This is a mistake. Trust me. I’ve done it and I suffer every day.So what’s the big deal you ask? Travel is supposed to expand your horizons, right? It’s supposed to make you think differently. For eons wiser men than myself have made proclamations about how it changes the way one sees the world.YES! That’s exactly what it does — and that’s the problem because young people are too susceptible to the effects of travel. Luckily, by the time you’ve exited your twenties you’ve likely acquired a career, loans, family, debt and numerous other obligations — all these things act as a suit of armor that protects you from travel’s nasty side effects.So what is the big deal?First of all, the person who you were before you traveled no longer exists. It’s scary. You won’t realize it at first but it slowly starts creeping up on you as you travel. You start to see how other cultures live. Their views on work and leisure and quality of life and food and public transportation and art and architecture and tradition — it all starts to permeate into your brain and it takes over.You’ll start asking yourself questions:“Do I want to work 60+ hour weeks and have barely any vacation time?”“Is there more to life than work?”“How come young people in other countries aren’t crippled with student loan debt?”“What is most important in my life?”“Why didn’t I study a foreign language?”“Maybe other countries do some things much better than we do them back home.”“How have people in other countries figured out how to enjoy life?”It doesn’t truly hit you until you’re back home because that’s when you discover “home” — the place that has always represented stability and comfort — doesn’t exist anymore either. Suddenly home feels different. It’s disorientating and it feels like you’re wearing someone else’s glasses. It will make you feel queazy.Speaking of home, it’s weird going from living out of a backpack to having a house full of stuff you’ve amassed. You realize having a house/apartment full of stuff doesn’t make you happy — in fact, all your stuff starts to feel a little overwhelming.But it gets worse.Your friends and family and peers — they won’t understand. In fact, they don’t really care that you’ve just gone through this transformative journey. You’ll tell them all about what you ate, saw, and experienced, but I’m telling you that their eyes will quickly gloss over. This will happen just about every time. If you’re lucky your parents will listen to your tales for a few minutes before wanting to stab finely sharpened #2 pencils into their ears.It’s lonely knowing that no one else will ever, or can ever, relate to your experiences. But you’ll continue the futile process of trying to tell your story. Be careful because your friends will quickly become sick of your stories.But that’s not all.As you settle back into your regular life you’ll find that you’re not satisfied. Trying to focus on school or work becomes nearly impossible because the lure of travel consistently calls your name. You’ll find yourself trying to get your fix with marathon sessions watching the Travel Channel, Anthony Bourdain, Rick Steves, and House Hunters International. You’ll seek out restaurants that serve food from the countries you visited — but it will never be as good as it was in France, Italy, or wherever you traveled. And God help you if you acquire a taste for Belgian beer because your bank account will suffer.You’ll find yourself randomly scouring the web for good deals on airfare or searching for cool places to stay on Airbnb — even though you have no time or money to travel.Spending time on facebook and instagram will become almost unbearable because you’ll see your friends posting pictures of their travels. It will bring back great memories but the depression of being stuck at home will quickly takeover.BUT THE WORST THING ABOUT TRAVELING IN YOUR TWENTIES IS THAT YOU WON’T BE ABLE TO STOP.You’ll spend your entire life traveling. You won’t be able to shake the travel bug. Whenever the possibility to visit another country arises you’ll take it. You’ll spend less time at the bar or choose a home cooked meal over a restaurant so you can add a little more to your travel fund. You’ll find other ways to skimp and scrounge because you have no choice but to see as much as the world as possible.It’s a crazy ride.

I don’t really have an excuse to travel alone anymore, and I miss it.I miss the times when I’d check in for a flight and let my eyes wander around the waiting area at the gate, trying to guess who my seat-mate would be. I always hoped I’d make a friend, yet still asked for a window seat, so I could stare out the window instead of having an unwanted conversation if my neighbor turned out to be a dud, which is what usually happened. I always got paired with the most unappealing partner, one whose body mass — or, worse, smell — would expand over the arm rest into my territory. Even then, it was something to write about, to chuckle 0ver silently.The best conversation always turns out to be the dialogue you have with yourself.When you’re alone, every moment is an opportunity for something exciting to happen. There’s nearly always room for one more, but usually not for two.The first time I traveled alone, I flew to London and took the Eurostar to Paris, where I was studying abroad. It was a transformative two-hour train ride because when I woke up, it was suddenly snowing and everyone was speaking French. When I ran my belongings through security at Gare du Nord, I unknowingly dropped my passport, only to have a stranger pick it up for me. The kindness of strangers shines through when you’re freed from a set tribe of friends, marking you as one of their own. When you’re alone, you belong to everyone.There are other perks of being a party of one. Like stopping to take a photograph without making anyone wait. Creating your own itinerary on your own whim. Eating wherever and whatever you’d like without a debate. You can walk away any loneliness and realize that sometimes it’s nice to keep quiet and just observe.Who am I, undefined in this foreign environment? Maybe I’m a tourist. Maybe I’m a mysterious passerby. Or maybe I’m just another person searching for connection. Just like everybody else.The second time I flew solo, I went to Hong Kong with a duffel bag and checked into the The next morning, I woke up, got my hair washed, and ate fried shrimp balls on a stick with spicy sauce — all for less than two dollars. I spent the rest of the day wandering around Lan Kwai Fong, stopping to eat delicious bubble tea, then an egg tart, then street-style shark fin soup with a BBQ chicken leg. I went to Afterwards, I continued to wear down my summer sandals, my eyes growing weary from the flashing neon lights of the city at night. When I returned to my tiny quarter, I found the owner of the hostel, a bug-eyed woman named Miss Kitty, waiting up to tell me with concern that my mother had called. I thanked her and went to my room. When I started to dial home, I realized that a few more hours of worrying until a morning call wouldn’t kill my mother. I slept more soundly that night than ever.Traveling alone is so underrated. Is it because we are so desperate to stay connected, afraid to be on our own and make our own decisions? Do we need other people to validate our good times?We shouldn’t. We — and by “we” I mean “I” — should book that ticket to that city or island or country that we always wanted to visit. I shouldn’t wait for anyone. I won’t wait for anyone to tell me that it’s okay or that they want to go too or that they have a place for me to stay. I’ll just go.The travel website reinvented: Get inspired. Plan your trip.

We have been called many things. Travelers, by default. But we like to be called nomads. Explorers. Vagabonds. Adventurers. Wayfarers. Modern gypsies. Wanderers. We’ve adopted them all. A growing breed of humans with restless feet and the inability to stay still, the inability to stay in one place.That is who we are. And that’s just the gist of it.We come from all walks of life, from bustling gray colored cities, sleepy beach towns, snow-covered metropolises, small villages nestled in between lush green mountains, we come from everywhere. But our inner gravity always brings us to the same place… the road.We deem courage weighs more than money when it comes to travel. We’re not rich, not financially well-off and we don’t travel for luxury. Our money does not come from rich parents, trust funds, or whatever privileges you think we have in order to maintain a life of travel. We work hard, or work while we travel and save whatever means we make. We travel at the cost of sacrifices. We’re happy living with just barely enough as long as we’re on the road. This means that we have given up plenty of comforts for the sake of travel. We would rather choose a dorm bed in a cheap hostel, a couch, a hammock, a tent, or concrete floor. We’ve slept in night boats, century old huts, train stations, in bamboo huts with indigenous tribes, in a house built on stilts in shantytowns and god knows where else.We have learned to live in depth without comforts. The uncomfortable becomes comfortable to us. Most of us don’t own homes, or if some of us do, they’re probably renting it out to use that money to travel  explore. We don’t spend our money lavishly on things we don’t need. We don’t buy many things, we don’t let things own us. We’ve learned that the less things we have, the better we live.We feel the most alive when we’re out there. Living nomadically with nothing but our possessions in a backpack and moving as our only constant. Anything is possible when we are given a brand new day in a place we have never been as we surrender ourselves to the currents of the universe.We are mesmerized by every culture. We act like sponges when we go to a new country we’ve never been to, we immerse ourselves into every experience and soak our souls with its depth. We believe that smiles are universal and no matter what language fills our ears, we can see people’s stories through a smile.We’ve learned to not let small annoyances, adversities, and misadventures get the best of us and we don’t let it ruin our days. We believe that in any given moment, we have the choice to suffer from whatever problems come our way, or just simply accept it. We’ve grown to choose the latter. We’re not afraid of troubles coming our way even if we are traveling alone most of the time. We’ve learned to face our fears and unlearn them so we grace through our days with courage. No matter whatever fears people project on us, we smile and look right past it. We have learned that if we constantly keep a sunny disposition and keep our light bright then we won’t see the shadows.We follow wherever the next sunrise and sunset takes us. We are guided by moon cycles and stardusts. We look up the the night sky, gaze up at the cosmos, and know that wherever we are and whoever we’re without, we are never really alone. And we are comforted by this very notion.We have dedicated our hearts to the road. Even when we’re not on it we’re working to save up for our next trip, every time we hear an airplane, we look up, smile and imagine ourselves on it. We know that the day is coming soon, and we are fueled by that thought. We go to bookstores to browse through the travel section, pick out travel guides and sit there skimming through the pages and daydreaming about our future travels. Our minds constantly drift away to the next destination on our list. Our wanderlust is insatiable and even when we feel it’s slaked, it doesn’t take long at all until we’re hungry again. And we’re hungry all the time.We travel not just to go, we travel to evolve. Embracing new experiences, endlessly changing horizons, and each brand new day as a way of living. We live for airports, planes, buses, boats, trains, road trips. We find clarity in the blur of the places zooming past us as we look through the window. This is our home. This will always be our home.These are the stories we will tell people, the ones we love, the ones we just met, the ones who come and ago, the perfect strangers. We will keep showing the others that we were born wanderers, that wanderlust resides within every single one of us. And that no matter who we are, where we are, what we do, and what we have we can always choose to follow it.We’re not saying that you should give up everything in your life this second, buy a ticket, and pack your backpack. Although you can if really want to, if everything inside of you is telling you to do so you should listen. But we’re saying that when you choose to strip away years of unnecessary baggage, you’ll find freedom. We’re not saying that you should take the risk and leap, then everything will always be peachy and perfect. It’s never like that. But what we’re saying is, you should allow yourself to be free. You should allow yourself to stand on the fringes of life, and dive into its alluring ambiguity. Even if it means facing your fears. Even if it means making sacrifices. Even if it means letting go of things you’ve held onto for so long. Even if it means having to let go of people you love. Even if it all terrifies you. We’re saying open yourself up to the world. Embrace all of its worth. Let its teachings seep into all that you are. When you do that, all your layers will peel off and you will discover your true self.And so here’s the truth. We travel not just to travel and marvel at people, places, things. That’s not just it. That was never just it for us. We travel to learn, to experience, and to feel all the spectrums of being human in this world.One day, when we are old with silver hair, freckles, creases, and laugh wrinkles from many years of wandering drenched under sunlight. Our children’s children will lay out with us under the stars by a campfire on a moonlit beach elsewhere. We will tell them stories of wild adventures, of lived dreams, of enchanting places, of conquered fears, of lessons that turned into gold, lessons that we’ve learned from the road, and a full life lived. Our journeys will inspire their own.Our journey is our truth. It’s the truth that illuminates us, as we continue on where we thrive and wander, on the road we call our home.-Nomadic seeker, wanderer, adventurer, photographer.

Just because we can’t all move to Europe to pursue a masters degree or spend a summer sailing around the Greek Islands on a yacht with a group of other twenty-somethings, does not mean we cannot travel. Or, at the very least, does not mean we should be dissuaded from doing so, as Chelsea Fagan does so articulately in her recent Medium article entitled, Fagan says that travel is ‘I believe that most people in this world could drop everything and move to another country, if that is their inner most desire.

This post is divided into two parts: As mentioned, a specific itinerary follows later in this article, but in general, what does one You want to design your trip so that you The Ring Road is designed perfectly for a road trip. According to Google Maps, and under ideal circumstances, the total drive time is around 17 hours. I recommend undertaking this in 8–10 days, which allows for plenty of time to explore (and importantly, venture into the West Fjords).To tackle the Ring Road, the first question is which direction should you drive? While “let’s just see what happens” is certainly an effective strategy in Iceland, it’s very important to plan your days such that you’re able to see everything in the most efficient order. I suggest planning each day’s itinerary before you leave, and then adjusting it A few things to consider when deciding when to go: the If you go during the high season, the temperature will be If you want snowy landscapes and the Northern Lights, go during the winter; just don’t expect to move around as easily. Many of the side roads become impassable.The Ring Road is open all year. Some of the unpaved and side roads, during the winter especially, can be closed to due snowfall (or volcanic activity). During the high season, most all roads are open. If you want full access to all of Iceland, try to go during May-August.Iceland is famous for its beautiful light. During the summer months, it’s one long perpetual sunset between 9pm-3am; it can be a very beautiful time to go for a photographer. If you want to see the Northern Lights, you must visit during the winter.After reading all of the above, it seems like a no brainer to go during the high season of June/July. The downside is the crowd. There is only one two-lane road around the whole island. All of the sites fill up substantially and it can be a mess trying to get a picture without a bus load of tourists plopped in your way.Given this, I think the best month to go, for a first time visitor, is August — it’s just off the high season, so there are slightly less people, it’s still bright most of the day, and there is no leftover snow (as there would be in May).Iceland requires a few unique items. Of course bring all the obvious things like clothes, sunglasses, toiletries etc; the items below are You do not want to rely on GPS in Iceland. A hard copy map is recommended and In Google Maps is extremely helpful for planning your route and getting a sense of The weather in Iceland is extremely unpredictable. The two most important questions to answer are: is it raining and how cold is it. Both of these questions can be answered with Use this to determine which days you want to prioritize the most visually exciting locations (for example, try not to visit the Fjords when it’s storming — you won’t be able to appreciate the vastness). I recommend checking this every morning and scouting your route for the day.Clothes are a very personal decision. I won’t give you specifics or repeat the “layers layers layers” trope because you’ve heard it before. Presumably you know how to dress yourself. I have a lot of specific recommendations for prosumer camera equipment to bring to Iceland. You can find all of these That said, it always pays to be versatile when traveling. Carry cash as a backup, but don’t expect to use it very much. Another consideration is foreign transaction fees — ideally, use a card that doesn’t gouge you on these.Decision: backpack or suitcase. Answer: depends on how you’re traveling. If you’re camping, sleeping in your car, or not staying in hotels, then a backpack is probably a good idea. You’ll want to be mobile and versatile.If you’re staying in hotels or Airbnbs, then you can probably get away with a suitcase. One thing to consider is that every night you will likely be staying in a new location; taking a suitcase in and out of a car can get annoying. Make sure you bring something that can move and pack easily. Personally, a suitcase works far better.There are plenty of accommodation options in Iceland around the entire Ring Road. The benefits of a hotel are obvious: clean bed, shower, roof, blackout curtains (don’t underestimate), food, etc. If you have the means, this is the best way to go.I have indicated specifically which hotels are my favorite below and in the itinerary section; they are spaced evenly around the Ring Road and are just the right distance apart to maximize activities and limit long drives.Camping is a great alternative for a few reasons: 1) You are in full control of your schedule and can move around significantly more versatilely than if you’re bound to check-in times. 2) During the summer months, you can invert your schedule so that you This exists in Iceland, but I don’t recommend it. It’s highly unlikely that there is availability outside of Reyjakvik, My favorite site to plan travel with is Booking.com. I’m not paid to say that. It’s just a terrific website with all the right tools (specifically the map and free cancelations!). Even tiny little places in Icelandic nether-regions use Booking.com.To get around Iceland, You want a car that can fit everyone and their stuff (with ideally 1–2 empty seats), go everywhere you want it to without burning millions of dollars of gas, and if you want a prop bonus, some cars look great in photos in Iceland (Landrover Defender).Driving in Iceland can be really scary. Even on the Ring Road, on a flat straightaway, things can be nerve-racking. The issue is There is also quite a bit of high-speed passing necessary (especially around RVs). This coupled with the insane surroundings makes extreme attention necessary at all times.The Ring Road is well maintained and generally fine to drive on, lane-width aside. You will also encounter plenty of “f-roads”, which come in all shapes and sizes. They are usually gravel and can be anywhere from 2 to zero lanes wide. Many sites are a few minutes drive off the Ring; to get to them, you’ll need to use the mysterious f-road. You will know pretty quickly if your car can handle it or not.You need a spare tire in Iceland, end of story. If you don’t have one you have grave unhappiness in your immediate future. You also need assurance from your rental agency that they have some means of getting to you in an emergency (they all say they do, but honestly, how is this possible?).At the very least, get a 4WD SUV. You don’t want to be concerned about where you can drive. I advocate for at least 1–2 empty seats in your vehicle. You can probably get away with suitcases etc in the trunk, but you also want plenty of space for quick-grab items like camera gear, rain jackets, hiking boots, food, etc. This type of miscellany needs space to float freely in the car and allow for quick access.We used Blue Car Rental both times and it worked great. It’s next to the airport and has good service and new cars. They also provide roadside assistance (though I don’t know the details–thankfully never needed it). The one time I got a flat tire I was able to hobble to a service shop in Vik.There is a ton to do in Iceland. Most of your time will be spent stumbling on amazing things by accident, but do allow some time for coordinated activities. Some highlights are below (though there are If you have any plans to take a helicopter tour in your life, take it in Iceland. It’s expensive, but it’s worth it.The best company is Norduflug and the best pilot is Gisli Gislason. I recommend the If you want to shoot photos/video from a helicopter, here are some things to keep in mind. For photo, you’ll want to shoot at the For video I recommend lenses with If you’re particularly adventurous, the hike to There are countless other activities in Iceland (plane rides, horseback riding, diving, ATVing). A lot of these depend on your personal preferences so I won’t delve into all the various options. In my experience, 30% of your trip should be dedicated to planned activities while the rest is reserved for exploration and adventures.If you branch out and try local restaurants, cafes and hotel eateries, then it’s very good. I get it, gas stations are cheaper; just don’t judge the cuisine of a country based on rest stop food.One thing to keep in mind is, This is probably the most reliable place to find 1) food, period, and 2) good food. In most of the towns there is at least one hotel. Usually this hotel has one place to eat, open at the normal times. Try and coordinate when you pass through such a town, with meal times. If that isn’t possible, plan ahead and take an extra meal to go in the morning.You’ll find varying sizes of Icelandic grocery stores depending where you are. Grocery store size and quality is typically correlated with proximity to Reykjavik and Akueryi. They’re usually closer to what Americans know as gas station travel marts: more like a rest stop mart than a full-blown Whole Foods.As mentioned, a cheap way to eat in Iceland is to buy meals at gas stations. Hotdogs are popular items in this case, and they are actually quite good. Try it, why not, but please don’t base your food intake on them unless you absolutely must. Again, anyone who tells you the food in Iceland is bad, was aggressively optimizing for cost, not food quality.The tips in the last section should get you pretty far on your Icelandic journey. No matter how you decide to traverse the island, you’ll see some incredible things and have You will likely land early in the morning; it’s best to start driving right away. You will eventually end up in Vik for the night; the drive from KEF is only about 3 hours, but there are some terrific stops along the way. It’s a great route to get acclimated to Iceland and the pace of things.*Note, avoid the Blue Lagoon until the very end, it’s better as a final stop. It’s too crowded and touristy to be your first Icelandic experience.The drive up to Hofn is about the same length as Day 1, three hours total. This leaves you plenty of time to explore and go on at least one longer adventure. This part of Iceland is still relatively tourist-heavy, as you’re still within striking distance of Reykjavik.On this day, it’s possible to drive all the way to the Lake Myvatn region if you want. That would take about six hours and you risk shortchanging some of the great stops along the way. It depends how much time you plan to stay in Myvatn — if you’d like two nights there, then it’s probably best to mash it from Hofn straight to Myvatn in one day. If you prefer a more leisurely pace, you can stop in Egilsstaoir for one night, which opens up some interesting detours.Getting to Myvatn, especially if you stayed the night in Egilsstaoir, is a quick drive. It’s about two hours from Egilsstaoir. This gives you plenty of time to explore the region.This region is also very susceptible to snow closures; if you’re visiting near the winter months, you may not be able to access places like Dettifoss (where the filmed Prometheus) or the Horse City (where they filmed Oblivion).On this day, you are basically crushing it all the way from North Iceland, to the edge of the West Fjords. It’s one of the longer drives you’ll have. The Fjords are their own beast, and require a night’s rest and full day to tackle. As such, you want to lay up somewhere at the base of the Fjords. The two hotels listed below are good options. You’ll also pass through Akureyri, which is Iceland’s second largest urban center. Worth a stop for food and supplies.If you stay in Hvammstangi,Where you go in the West Fjords is entirely up to you. Know that the road conditions change dramatically out there — make sure you’re measuring drive-times on you map as everything takes about 1.5x as long. Your goal should be to get as much coverage as you can; I recommend finding a hotel on the interior to allow this.You’re almost home! This next drive takes you to Thingvellir National Park, which is very close to the Golden Circle attractions. Depending where you’re leaving from (Hellnar, or Heydalur), the drive is 2 or 5 hours respectively. This drive is Getting to Reykjavik from the ION is very quick, no more than an hour. The drive is very straightforward, especially compared to what you’ve experienced so far.This itinerary allots only one night in Reykjavik. I think this is all you need though others may disagree. It’s just not a very big city; it’s easy to take it all in in one day/night. I do suggest taking a helicopter tour, and if you do this, it can eat up about half a day depending on the tour you choose. The city itself can be taken in pretty quickly on foot.The last thing a lot of people do in Iceland is visit the Blue Lagoon (about 45min from Reykjavik, near the airport). If you’ve never been, go check it out. But personally, I think you can skip it. It’s very crowded and feels too much like w waterpark to me. Other lagoons on the island are much better (Myvatn Nature Baths) and provide the same experience without the hassle.My goal with this page was to provide you a one-stop resource for your Iceland trip.

It’s currently summer time (at least here in Europe) and many people go on vacation during this time of the year. I do the same.Basically, I love traveling. I love exploring new places, people and cultures. It’s the greatest luxury I could ever imagine.But the more I travel and the more new places I see, the more I think about the way we travel these days.Not for the moment itself, but for the selfies and instagram pictures we take. We don’t select our destinations by wanderlust, but by how fancy they are. We rush from restaurants to sights to places all recommend by Yelp or Tripadvisor being afraid that we The pressure of social media has made us to become In 2013 I spent half a year abroad and wondered how I could adapt myself to not be a tourist in a foreign city, but rather a resident.I watched a lot of tourists at that time rushing through the streets with their smartphones  cameras aiming for the next At the time I began to realize what traveling really is about. At least what it is for me.It’s not about getting to see every super-awesome sight recommend by tripadvisor. It’s not about going to the best rated restaurants on Yelp. It’s not about rushing through the streets being afraid missing something.They happen on some random no-name street where you stumble into an elderly local philosophizing about the world. It happens when you go to non-tourist restaurants and bars eating, drinking and having fun.project manager / blogger / student of media management / master thesis about content marketing / interested in marketing, startups, digital strategies and moreStories on life, work and travel as a digital nomad by 

Heart to heart, I’d like to congratulate you. It’s been a long road. You’ve done a lot of things. You’ve been a lot of places. You’ve been given away and returned, torn down and built up, emptied and filled, battered and healed - but you’re still here, beating on. You’ve wandered through mazes of emotions, and you’ve lived to tell the tale. Now, I want to hear it.Once upon a time, in a land far, far away - I was trapped in the tangles of my blankets wrestling with a feeling that had haunted me several times in my life. My bones ached. My frame felt hollow. I missed something, so much, that my body was physically revolting it’s absence. All I could think about, though, was how amazing it was that I could ever be so full of a person, a place, a time - whatever it is, that I could feel it’s absence in my bones. Being me - I smiled and thought to myself, “this has to be one of the greatest feelings we can experience, I should try to capture it in a poem.”Later, I spoke to someone about it and they quickly began to think about their own greatest feeling. They immediately gave up a piece of themselves to me, that part of their heart they’d felt the most. It wasn’t anything like mine, and that made it even more beautiful. What they’d shared, and their openness in sharing it, had filled me with their feeling so much I had to write about it too. Something started building in my head, but I needed to explore more.I posted this status to see what would happen, and I ended up dancing around like a giddy five year old all day. (That may or may not be common behavior for me.)So many people started messaging me. My closest friends, people I had hardly spoken to - even strangers, all bearing their hearts for me to see. With answers filling a range as vast as the spectrum in a rainbow, I was amazed. Themes starting appearing as well, webs of words and relations shared with me by individuals in different countries, age groups, professions, etc. I wished that they could all see how connected they really were - maybe buy a tv spot and publicly announce “open your heart and collect your feels, share them with the world, and know that no matter what we’re all connected somehow.”I know words, and I’ve been (at least attempting) using them to convey feelings through poetry for as long as I can remember. Now, that’s exactly what I’m doing with the feelings I’ve been gifted - by turning them into a series of haikus entitled As I embark on a nomadic journey starting in Iceland and winding through most of Europe, I’m going to leave them for you too. You’ll find them on your benches and street signs, stealing the shadows in your corners and replacing them with a piece of someone’s heart.Come on, you knew it was coming. I want to know what This can be a literal emotion, or something more abstract, e.g.:Here are things you can do if you want to join in.Thank you, hearts, for doing so much and making it to me today.I’d love to talk to you more on Traveler. Writer. Designer. Hacker. All in a constant rotation of priority.An international poetry series — collecting your greatest feelings and leaving them as haikus scattered across the world. It’s a poetic exploration and celebration of our hearts. Take part!

I tossed and turned, my stomach ache getting worse every minute. “If only someone could be here with me, bring me water and help me to a doctor… “, I thought to myself. My fever was so high there was no point in measuring any more. All I wanted to do is stay in bed and feel sorry for myself.Bad idea.I was alone in a small hotel in north India.I needed to All my points below are true for both men and women but I am focusing here on women for a few reasons:Here are 7 reasons why you should venture out on your own and come back a much stronger and capable female leader:Traveling solo doesn’t mean you are alone, it just means you are in charge of yourself and you make your own decisions.In most cases you meet people and join them for a period of time with no strings attached. When your joint adventure with the group is over, you can decide if you want to keep traveling with them or go to other places, do other activities or meet new and different people.As a solo traveler you make your own decisions, constantly, and build your own agenda. You take into account weather conditions, the character of the people you meet, availability of money, schedules and passions — As a solo traveler When leading a company or an organization — you have a team around you and you’ll listen to their arguments, but eventually you’ll make the decisions and deal with the repercussions of those decisions. Your head will spin from the number of decisions you will need to make daily and no one will make them for you.I walked happily to the train in Bolivia that would take me to the beautiful salt dessert. But when I walked up to the train conductor to hand him my ticket, he looked at me seriously and said “You can’t go on the train because your bag is too big. The next train is in three days you can try to make it on that one.”For someone traveling for 5 months, my backpack was relatively small but had a sleeping bag and tent attached to it from the outside, Making it look bulky. I tried persuading, begging and suggesting workarounds for how he could allow me on the train, with no luck.I stepped away from the train trying to think what else I could do and decided to try detaching my sleeping bag and tent from my backpack and holding them in my hands. Now my backpack looked tiny but my hands were full of stuff. Doubting this would work, I walked towards the train again and handed my ticket to the train conductor, somewhat embarrassed. Shockingly, it worked! Apparently your hands stuffed with crap is ok but everything tied to the backpack? Not ok. Oh well.I made it to the salt dessert and learned my lesson. For every problem, there are a few obvious solutions and many hidden ones. Make sure you learn to think fast and see all possible solutions — it’s a precious trait.In business, how many times did your developers tell you ‘impossible’, investors said ‘No’ to a meeting, or something you tried to do simply failed? Just like in travel, there is always a way — you just need to learn to find it and not take ‘no’ for an answer.You will run into many people who are different than you with different looks, beliefs, and economic situations.Smile and say “hi” — why not make this a happier world?Lend a hand when possible — whether its volunteering in some remote school, helping an old lady with her bags or bringing small gifts to locals — Its amazing how much more connected you will feel by making these small gestures.The same goes for your business. Whether it’s the shy engineer in the corner, the admin or the person cleaning the office — stop for a second to say “hi” and smile — it goes a long way. You will be rewarded by a much better atmosphere around the office and more motivated and dedicated staff.Whether the hotel gave you a filthy room, the taxi driver took you to the wrong side of the city, the trip you wanted was much more expensive than advertised — you’ll need to be assertive to fix the wrong. No need to shout. Be firm and make it very clear that a line was crossed, and you simply wont accept it.I take it back.Its I was on a bus in Thailand heading back to Bangkok. Somehow the bus felt way too empty. Usually these buses are packed with travelers. Mmm… this seemed weird. Where did I buy the tickets? Did it look like a sketchy place? I couldn’t recall but felt like it was wrong to go on that bus. It was my first trip solo and I was still not sure what to watch out for. I thought to myself that I must have been wrong and so I took a seat on the bus. The bus left on time and made its way north.After 20 min it stopped suddenly.“Weird — there is nothing around here and we have about 12 hours to go…” I thought to myself. The driver got up and asked us to get off the bus and to give him $100 each otherwise he wouldn’t continue. Angry with myself for not trusting my instinct, I climbed down and everyone gathered outside the bus. The driver disappeared presumably to let us gather the money he requested and possibly to call for ‘helpers’. What would prevent him from taking the $100 and stopping again in 30 min? Would this end with just money or should I get out of there? I remembered we had passed some houses not too long before, so I told the few tourists with me that I was not staying. Everyone agreed and decided to join me and we started running back towards the houses hoping it was the right decision and that the diver wouldn’t see us. We made it safely and we will never know what would have happened if we had stayed.No one knows.But both in travel, and in business, you should listen to your instincts. They are usually right. Obviously in both situations you want to back your decisions by data, but instincts are critical.In travel, especially when you are alone and can’t rely on others, you develop your instincts about people, places and surroundings very quick due to the constant changes.In business you’ll use this capability constantly whether you are interviewing new hires, assessing how your team is doing, or at assessing customers’ reactions to your latest demo.If you are not a hiker — go on a hike.If you never bungee jumped — go ahead and try it.Being a solo traveler, by definition, is being outside your comfort zone but taking it to the next level, you’ll feel more alive and build stronger memories.By experiencing life out of your comfort zone you build coping tools that are extremely important. Starting your own business venture or leading an organization requires being almost continuously out of your comfort zone. There are always new things to tackle and you can’t let stress and anxiety interfere with your thinking and decision making.These are some of the important lessons you learn quick when traveling. Fellow travelers will know where to find cheaper tickets and what trails are nicer than others. Locals can tell you a lot about their life, politics and topics you usually know nothing about.Learning to listen and deciding what to take from any conversation is key and will be extremely useful as you listen to the opinions of your team, executives or customers. You won’t take everyone’s advice, but listening and evaluating all opinions makes people around you feel like they count and allows you to make better decisions and be a better leader.So, no excuses.Pick a spot on the globe that you want to conquer, decide how much time you have to explore and go do it.The world is beautiful and you’ll feel so much more alive experiencing it. But on top of that, you’ll simply come back a more mature, independent and strong woman with great instincts and superb people skills and you’ll be ready for a life of entrepreneurship, leadership and making your dreams come true.If you like this read, check out also my post:Founder of Stiya, the memory in your pocket (Women learning the hard way.

Did you know that every time you swipe your card in a foreign country, your bank is charging you exorbitant fees and giving you a terrible exchange rate? Yet, you can save thousands every year by choosing the right bank.If you travel abroad for a week or two per year, 3–5% in various fees and bad exchange rates for international card use is not really a big problem. But as a frequent traveler or digital nomad spending most of your time abroad these fees add up quickly. In fact, you might be donating hundreds or even thousands of dollars yearly to your bank. I’m sure you could think of a better way to spend that money.But what if I told you that there are banks out there that charge no monthly fees, 0% foreign transaction fees, 0% currency exchange markup, 0% ATM withdrawal fees and even refund fees imposed by ATM owners worldwide? Sounds like some sort of black magic right? Well it’s not. I spent countless hours finding the best banks for nomads in North America, Europe and Oceania, so you don’t have to. Read on to learn more about these incredible banks and how you can open an account with them today.My favorite bank in Europe must be *AFAIK, they do not refund fees that the owner of the ATM might add, , which is a common practice in large parts of the world.Nemea is definitely not like other banks. It’s 100% online (they don’t even offer a debit or credit card yet. By far my favorite bank for nomads in the US, and perhaps even in the world. Pretty much anything is free, from all card usage globally to unlimited free checks (if you still use those). They even refund you unlimited amounts of ATM fees imposed by ATM owners worldwide.The only thing that leaves me wanting a bit more is their online banking solution. It’s quite messy, and I’m not pleased with their password security. Your password can be a Like most US banks it also requires you to be a US resident. But as long as you keep a US address on file they assume you are living there. If you don’t have a US address while traveling or living abroad your account *You will be charged Citibank has earned a reputation for being a good option for Aussie travelers. Although their internet banking is so-so, with the Citibank Plus Transaction Account you get fee free banking around the globe, with no foreign transaction fees and you get the official *They do not refund fees that the owner of the ATM might add, which is a common practice in large parts of the world.I have included all the nomad friendly banks I came across in my research, but if I missed a bank in your country please If you’re not able to open accounts with any of the banks listed in this article, check if there’s a bank in the Another alternative can be using a bank with a large global presence, such as If you successfully open one of the bank accounts that I’ve listed above, you might wonder how you can fund your account if your current account is in a different country. There are many ways of accomplishing this, but often using a service such as Curator of Your guide to a location-independent life

My job as an I often get asked on twitter and other social platforms wether I am on a constant vacation and therefore never work. First of all, I’m running a In the end it all comes down to just doing it, because if you feel you can provide a benefit to your life and to the results you deliver, there is only yourself hindering your progress.Nike famously put it into words: People tend to set strict boundaries for themselves, mostly we are over-concerned and therefore limit our own experience throughout life. I am no extraordinary being and this happens to me too, all the time. Once you breakthrough this negativity and the fear that limits your experience, you can finally go travel freely while delivering the best work your clients could imagine.As an example from my experience: Clients often hire me to work on-site as leader or part of their web-team. As you can imagine, this interferes with my urge to travel. Nevertheless, whenever I am planning a new trip, wether it’s a conference I’d like to attend or a retreat with the people from my The recipe for this, is to build a great relationship with your client, one that is based on open communication and mutual trust. Of course your work has to be rock-solid and you have to be reliable and most important responsive. This is especially true when you decide to travel to a different timezone while working for a client back home.I keep getting inspired when I am working somewhere else. I truly believe that it makes me a better designer and a more sensible human being, as I tend to see and appreciate the creative solutions people come up with, even though many tend to have far more constraints than we have at home.Travelling while working for your clients can be quite exhausting and there are certain drawbacks and challenges you face, compared to a regular office job or staying at home. You have to accept that the nomadic lifestyle is by far more unstructured and presents you with challenges you haven’t thought about while staying in your comfort zone known as your home base.When you are aware of these challenges you can get most out of it while escaping your boring environment back home.I just started a long-term work-travel trip to South America, Australia and Thailand. I’m writing this from almost 3500 meters above sea level in Read my post about the preparation it took to go on a long-term work and travel trip:I didn’t find a path through life — I created one!

What happened when I packed my life into a backpack and left home with a one-way ticket?Since then, I’ve lived in 3 continents, been to 14 countries, flew all around the globe, met hundreds of fascinating and inspiring people, burned thousands of calories lifting weights in gyms, ate amazing foods on the streets, cafes, restaurants and hotels, I’ve snorkelled, rode a boat, drove hundreds of kilometres on a scooter, chilled out on a paradise island, been in a relationship, seen dozens of temples, slept in a bungalow in a jungle, done numerous of interviews, grew my business but most important, I started to love the world and life more than ever before.Simply put, I’ve experienced and learned more than I ever could have if I have stayed at home. Today I’d like to share some lessons I’ve learned traveling and exploring the world with an average budget of $1000/month.I never thought I’d be homeless by choice, I never thought I would exchange financial security for freedom, I never thought I would become a writer, teacher, speaker, entrepreneur, I never thought of myself as a nomad, I never thought I would travel around the world while doing what I like but all these things happened in a year.I’ve had many misleading perceptions and beliefs that changed entirely while traveling and opened my eyes and changed my way of thinking.Simplifying my life and spreading the minimalist lifestyle has become my daily activity. Experiencing and collecting moments not things has made me happier than ever before, not having any physical possessions cause very little to no problems and leave my head fresh and empty. While I still do have some stuff which is a quality laptop for work, and phone for communication and camera, I don’t really try to get any fancy clothes or other things that would weigh me down and allow me to brag about these temporary belongings.Money-wise I am still in a transition from a freelancer to an entrepreneur, meaning that I still do work that exchanges my hours into dollars to sustain my lifestyle and fund my ventures such as I’ve learned to stop collecting things or saving money for things I don’t really need, chasing expensive toys is not for me anymore, I wish you could let go of that idea of collecting things that simply tie you to one place and make your life more messy and complex.All of my belongings fit into a simple backpack, I’ve never had less stuff in my life, but never felt richer in my life at the same time.Nothing is completely good or completely bad. I’ve learned to give up my ego and really stop, observe and think before judging something. There is no right or wrong, traveling to many places and meeting people have taught me that what is right in Europe might be completely wrong in Asia such as putting whitening cream on your skin in Asia and putting tanning cream in Europe. Driving 7 people on a scooter and a dog and numerous of shopping bags are completely OK in Southeast Asia while here in Europe driving alone in a car is acceptable.I came to a conclusion that being right is no longer my goal, because there is simply no such thing, better focus on understanding people and empathising to connect with them on a deeper level, just because you have certain beliefs or habits or traditions it doesn’t make you right.When I stopped fighting for being right all the time I became happier, Jon Yongfook published a great article on his experience living and I’ve been working in London for over a year making much more than that but it depends a lot on the context, as many other things in life, so it’s hard to expect that traveling around the world you will easily make the same money as working on site in a studio located in London.If you are like me when I’ve started my journey — little to no experience, little to no connections, enormous passion for traveling, thirst of adventures and courage of losing or winning it all, then read on.If you think there is a secret to cheap traveling and seeing the world on a tight budget, it must be a Browse Below are flight search engines I’ve used to book cheap tickets to Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Bali, Ho Chi Minh, Los Angeles, New York, London and many other destinations.Actual ticket cost: $222 for a direct flight from Stockholm (ARN) to Bangkok (BKK).Try to get to one of these international/regional hubs like in Europe we have London that can fly you anywhere; New York or Los Angeles in the USA, in Southeast Asia it can be Kuala Lumpur, Singapore or Bangkok with cheap airlines like The most expensive flights are from one continent to another. I’ve paid $598 for a one-way ticket from Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) — Tokyo (Japan) — Los Angeles (USA).Domestic flights are pretty cheap, I’ve paid $61 for a roundtrip from Bangkok (DMK) — Chiang Mai (CMX) — Bangkok (DMK) with AirAsia.When booking a room or a flight, make sure to uncheck everything airlines and hotels try to offer you by default (e.g. hotel, airport pick-up, car, insurance, priority boarding, meals, reserved seat, SMS confirmation, etc.).I’m a light traveler. I prefer to pack little and have a luxury of mobility and flexibility. It’s better to have a budget to buy something in case you need rather than carrying a huge luggage with you.Always pack the most necessary things for you travels, earlier I’ve written a I’ve already spent hundreds of dollars in fees for my bank providers in Lithuania and the United Kingdom. Lloyds bank seems to be the worst choice ever when traveling, charging me for every single transaction.In some countries like Indonesia, foreigners pay a higher price for services like gym membership just because they are foreigners. Might look quite racist at the first glance but makes sense once you find out how low local income is, so everyone can afford it, fair enough.In the summer of 2013 I’ve traveled around the Europe with my best friend In the USA, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia the story is totally different. Unless you are from one of the Asian countries like Singapore, Japan, South Korea, you will have a lot of hassle getting visas and paying for them. Most countries like Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Singapore issue visa on arrival for free or a fixed fee, depending where you come from, but some countries require an invitation letter from the country like Vietnam, other countries take couple of weeks to process the visa (India).Visa on arrival in Indonesia for 30 days costs $35, you can do one more month extension for the same fee by going to the immigration bureau.Visa on arrival in Thailand for 15 days costs 1000 baht (~$30), 60-day tourist visa costs the same and can be issued at your own country’s Thai embassy.Visa on arrival is free in Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia and allows you to stay from 30 to 90 days depending on the country.For more accurate information about visas check the table showing how many countries you can visit with your country passport.People are scared of going to new places because they don’t have home there. Finding accommodation on a budget might be really challenging in particular places, especially the ones loved by the tourists. To avoid high costs, choose places that are not in the area of touristic attractions and consider going in the low season. Below are some of the services I’ve used for finding an accommodation in different places in the world.Agoda lets you search hotels and hostels and offers very nice discounts, especially in Southeast Asia region.I loved using it in Bali, Kuala Lumpur and many places in Thailand as it shows prices with all the fees and service charges included as well as they don’t charge anything from your card, you just pay once you get there. Cancelation policy is super strict but if you certainly know you will stay there, it’s fine. However, check reviews and general ratings before making a final decision.During the low season in Bali, Malaysia and Thailand Booking.com had some pretty cool deals for 30–60% off, including this 3-star resort with a breathtaking ocean view.I’ve never used it in the USA or Asia to find an accommodation, but it worked for me and Justas couple of times in Europe and the Middle East (Dubai, UAE). It’s a great tool to meet up with locals, though. I’ve met so many cool people and travelers at the It’s a cool service that connects locals renting their place with short or long-term travelers. Airbnb gets pretty expensive on high seasons and especially if you stay a night or two in one place and then book another one as fees add up quickly.What I do is simply set the rent duration to a month and get a special monthly price which has a better value and can get you places with swimming pool, breakfast included, free coffee/tea and room service every single day for $405/month.If you have never used Airbnb, I highly recommend you to try it, use Taxi costs around $0.17/km what makes it very affordable to go even longer distances.One of the best thing about traveling is food unless you don’t like to eat. Trying out new food in different countries is extremely exciting, however not always end up very well, too sweet, too sour, too spicy, too stinky. Anyway, food in Thailand, Bali, Singapore is incredible. I just love everything I get there. And it’s also very cheap, eating out is cheaper than cooking by yourself and it saves you time buying groceries, storing food, preparing it and cleaning up afterward.A simple meal in Bali, Thailand, Vietnam can cost you from $1 to $3 depending on the place.When traveling to cheaper countries in Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, take advantage of eating out as it will conserve a lot of willpower that needs to be spent on cooking.In more expensive countries like most of the Europe, the United States or more developed countries in Asia like Singapore, Malaysia, Japan can be very expensive to eat out. If you have a tight budget, get some groceries at a local store and cook at home, if you want to try local food, make new friends and exchange dinners. On weekends or special occasions treat yourself with a dinner or lunch at a restaurant trying out local meals.Exercising for me personally is the best way to maintain a healthy happiness level and have a feeling of achievement at the end of the day. It improves the sleep quality, allows quick adjustment to the environment and clears my head. I’ve been regularly exercising for around 14 years now and hitting the gym or going for a run has been one of the daily activities while traveling around the world.You should exercise no matter what kind of lifestyle you have or where you live, it has enormous benefits for your body as well as mentioned psychological benefits. Simply find something you really enjoy, whether it’s running, swimming, yoga, martial arts, body weight exercises, anything works as long as you break a sweat.Your mind is the limit, what your mind believes your body can achieve, if you are totally exhausted and you command yourself to do 10 pushups it will be definitely hard but if you truly believe it, picture yourself doing it, eventually you’ll find the energy and willpower to do it.Finding a gym is quite hard and can get pretty expensive if you’re staying short-term. For that reason use To get better deals at local gyms, always negotiate, no matter where you go, always ask for a discount or a special offer. If that doesn’t work, google coupons for gyms in that area, or use deal websites like Traveling is generally entertaining experience but you can make it even better by visiting local clubs, pubs, bars, concerts, exhibitions, sport games, cinemas, hiking spots, city tours, and other touristic stuff. Once again, do a quick research and find what people are talking about in a certain area. Personally, I prefer to immerse myself in fewer activities and get a deeper understanding of culture and people, rather than seeing everything on a surface level. I recommend checking guides on Traveling and just seeing places gets pretty boring after some time (I’ve been there, done that). Missing out on meeting new people and making friends is a complete failure of traveling in general. At the very beginning it is very scary because you are in a new place, you don’t know the language, history, traditions, but you will be surprised if you start a conversation with a stranger. I’ve made hundreds of friends throughout my travels and now coming back to one or another country I have someone I know to ask out for a coffee.If you are more introverted you will find it very difficult and alienating to make new connections. However, nowadays our technology is bridging the gap between you and incredible people you want to meet.

Traveling to a new country is always exciting, especially if it’s a foreign one.We visualize ourselves meeting interesting people from another part of the world, discovering new cultures, and trying out exotic foods.Just thinking about it has us jumping up from our chairs!Before we get lost in the moment, let’s take a step back to prepare ourselves for the trip itself.Here’s 7 essential things to check off on your travel checklist before your departure.When you’re traveling to a foreign country, there’s strict rules that must be followed if we want to enjoy the fruits of the country.*a. Passport ID pageNow that we know how we’ll enter the country, we need to figure out where we’ll be staying. Depending on how long you’ll be staying in one place, and how often you plan to be traveling, there’s a few options you can choose from.We’ll rank the options listed in terms of cost, convenience, and easy access to new people.If you’re planning to stay in a country for more than 3+ months, we highly recommend renting out an apartment or house. You’ll save more money, and have the ability to live a more stable lifestyle.If you’re traveling to a foreign country, chances are you’ll need to Depending on your current level in the language:If you have zero comprehension of the language, it’s important to know simple phrases that will help you get around. Phrases may include:a. Hello, goodbyeb. Where is _____?c. I don’t speak _______d. How much is this?e. My name is _______Rype has a Whether you’re looking to improve your skills or looking to familarize yourself with how native speakers communicate, immersing yourself with actual native speakers is the best way to prepare before your travels.This is how we However, unlike practicing an instrument, where we can practice on our own, few of us have native speakers around us that we can practice with at our convenience.You can check out We currently have Spanish, and you can try out a Although these warnings can be exagerated, it’s better to be at least aware of these advisories. Check out your government’s travel site for any recent news on what you should watch out for.No matter where we travel to, there’s always areas we should avoid entering, or at least take extra precaution in. However, instead searching for places to avoid, researching the best neighborhoods to stay will save you more time.This mostly applies to emergency health insurance, because we’re more vulnerable while traveling, and the last thing we want is a hefty bill that we can’t cover.Depending on how flexible you are with your travels, buying insurance that allows you to cancel/change around your flights without a fee may also be a good option.Simplicity always wins here.We have this common belief that we should bring everything we own to our travels. The truth is, we use only a small portion of our possessions on a regular basis, and more importantly, we can buy almost everything we need when we arrive — most likely at a cheaper cost.A few tips here:You can use When you’re going abroad, it’s important to let your bank know that you’ll be using the card while you’re traveling. This is because your bank will block your card when they see abnormal activity for security purposes, such as card usage from another part of the world.It’s highly recommended to do this before because when you’re on the other side of the world, it can be very difficult to re-activate your card without entering your bank branch to prove your identity.Depending on where you’re going, you could either take two approaches here:This could be a good option if the exchange rates are at your favor, and you want to have enough cash prepared before you arrive there.Usually, this works for places that are experiencing inflation, and where currency from developed nations are stable.For example, in Buenos Aires it’s possible to exchange your US dollar for nearly double ($1 US to 14–15 pesos) the normal exchange rate ($1 US to 8.5 pesos).If you can check off even 5 out of 7 things on this checklist, you’re well on your way to being prepared for your trip abroad.We’re excited for your adventurous journey ahead, and we can’t wait to hear your stories.Let us know below where you’re traveling to and what you learned from this post!Adventurer, Entrepreneur, Lifehacker.

Internet is everywhere, so why should work be confined to an office? Being a digital nomad is a lot of fun, but can be harder than your current lifestyle. The office worker’s routine is instinctual in our culture: commutes, cubicles, conference calls, coffee, comp time. If you’re thinking of taking the leap, here’s what current income-earning globetrotters have to say about making it work.Most knowledge-based work can take place online, from graphic design and business consulting to telehealth and online education. While some employers hire location-independent workers, many digital nomads are You’ll need Internet to work while traveling. Armando and Mel travel by van, so their Fortunately, there are lots of options: Slow travel — spending more time in fewer places — helps with work-life-travel balance tremendously. It will also help you Remember, you’re living — not vacationing, trying to cover as much ground as possible in one week. Give yourself the opportunity to live like a local and you’ll have a richer experience.“Everyone you meet, and even people you know well, assumes you are on a perma-vacation,” says Jenny. A lot of people still have traditional ideas about work. If you’re not clocking in somewhere, you must be (f)unemployed, they think. On the other hand, some might think you’re a workaholic who can’t stop checking email on vacation. “We were staying at a small hotel and every time we tried to work in the dining area, the owner would good-naturedly nag us to put away the computers and go enjoy the town,” Jenny recalls. Be patient and polite, and remember they’re just trying to help!If you’re considering the digital nomad lifestyle, you probably have a higher tolerance for risk than the average person. Still, making a life change of this magnitude can be scary. If you’re nervous, that’s normal — just don’t let it stop you. “Stop thinking about it and do it!” Jenny says. “Trust that things will work out. They always do one way or another.”-Traveling N.

Some time ago Right now I’m doing a lot of work with video calling. I work with one client on a long-term contract, and our goal is to build new tools for connecting people regardless of where they are. For the nerds out there, it’s a I’ve been location-independent for about 8 years, and I’ve been So far I’ve put in long periods of time in Barcelona, Madrid, London, and Chiang Mai. Everywhere else I stayed less than a week, which doesn’t feel like a fair amount of time to really get a feel for the place.My favorites have been Barcelona and Chiang Mai by far.London was too expensive and — as a US citizen — way too similar to being back in the US. We stayed in Dalston, which is a pretty hipsterish neighborhood north of Shoreditch, and what it really felt like was being back in Portland and paying twice as much for the privilege.Madrid was a great city, but we were there in February and it was cold as balls. I want to go back when the weather isn’t so cold and try again, because I felt like I could love it there if I wasn’t frozen.Barcelona was incredible. Mild weather in the winter, which is always a plus, and a fantastic pace of living. The food was incredible, the prices were reasonable (we spent less than our Portland monthly average, which we consider a win), and the people were very friendly. In all fairness, though, I probably have a soft spot for this city because they’re big into Chiang Mai is everything you’ve heard it would be: cheap, beautiful, friendly, and surprisingly well-equipped to handle the location-independent lifestyle. My only complaint about Chiang Mai is that it’s too far from a beach — when it’s this hot outside, I like to spend a lot of time in the ocean. What it lacks in large bodies of water, however, is more than made up by the high quality and low cost of the food here. (#protip: Make friends with the proprietors of no-name restaurants.)My style is a little different, though, because I’m not big on coworking spaces. I get the majority of my work done from a coffee shop, and I can do a lot of my work even on a slow (or no) internet connection, so my requirements for a place are pretty low. I tend to grade more on what I can do when I’m Every time I read about people who work and travel, they talk about the difficulty of being somewhere exotic, looking out the window, and having to choose to sit down and work.Call me weird, but I don’t have that problem.My working philosophy, in simplified terms, has three core components:1. 2. 3. On the weeks where I stick to all three guidelines, I get everything on my list done and still have plenty of time to go explore the places I’m visiting.Oh, and also: if you can help it, book a month minimum in each place you want to visit. The week surrounding travel is less productive, so if you have to pack up and leave every week or two, it’s very easy to get caught in a panicky, holy-shit-where-did-all-my-time-go kind of routine. Giving yourself more time to really settle into a location — in addition to helping you If you don’t want to stay somewhere for a full month, book it as a vacation and don’t schedule any work while you’re there.For most of them, nothing changed. I’ve always worked from home, so my clients don’t know (or care) where I am, provided I’m responsive and get things done on time. When I hired contractors and employees, it was always remotely; I’ve actually seen I learned a long time ago that My family has been very supportive, but it’s been tough on my mom. She worries, and I haven’t been able to convince her that I’m probably safer in most places I’m visiting than I would be in New York City. But I think, beneath the worry, she thinks it’s pretty exciting. I keep in touch using Skype and Google Hangouts, so I’m never really that far away.My friends are all reasonably heavy travelers, so I’m able to meet them in various places. In a couple weeks I’m meeting some friends at a conference I’m speaking at in London. A good group is getting together in Vegas in June, and another group in Toronto shortly afterward.Beyond that, it’s been wonderfully easy to make new friends on the road. Between digital meetups like It can be tempting to get into a routine and do the same thing every day. This goes against everything I said I wanted when I started traveling, so I have to be aware of my tendency to settle into comfortable rhythms. Routines are important, but only when used in moderation.I also struggle a bit with keeping in touch with friends and family. I get engrossed in a project or book, and by the time I remember that I wanted to call my brother it’s 3am his time — I need to get better at keeping communication with loved ones higher on my priority list.I have a feeling we’re in a kind of Golden Age for remote work. Legislators haven’t been able to figure out what exactly to do with permanent travelers, so we slip through a lot of cracks undetected.I worry that in the relatively near future these loopholes will be closed — especially the ambiguity around where work is happening when we’re on our computers — and we’ll be looking at hoops to jump through.I hope I’m wrong, though. Maybe our numbers are too low for governments to care just yet.Aside from that, I also see the potential for this lifestyle to become even more accessible as sites like Airbnb make it easier to find places to stay, wifi becomes even more ubiquitous and reliable, and more companies start to realize they won’t keep high-quality employees long if they’re chained to a desk.The big ones are to remove the anchors in your life and keep in mind that many of the costs that keep us scraping by in the US just don’t exist when you live on tourist visas (utilities and mobile phone contracts, for example).This life is more affordable than anyone who hasn’t tried it will believe. And — if you’re the kind of person who likes a challenge — it’s more rewarding than I ever would have guessed.UX designer and long term digital nomad.

My Procedure, Best Picks and Data Roaming Package AdviseThere are a lot of good articles from people who share their experience of being a “Digital Nomad”, working and traveling the world. For example a good friend of mine Most of the articles I read about this topic are written by men. But certainly women have different challenges and needs while traveling. So this is why I decided to share my story how I prepared myself.Although I really don’t like to pack, I had to pack around 10 times this year for several trips to conferences and hack weeks with my I know it’s hard! Being on the road for a couple months means carrying your stuff everywhere. I found it really hard to decide what to leave at home, because space and weight restrictions are very tough.Traveling for a longer period also means that you will wear the same stuff over and over. That’s why it’s a good thing to bring some functional clothes which are light in weight and dry fast. Especially the ones who keep you warm when it gets chilly. Keep an eye on the color of your clothes and shoes, make sure they are generic and match most of the stuff you brought with you.Inspired of my work as an Initially I identified all the main topics to cover: working, entertainment, sport, hiking, money and clothing.I went through all the topics and added my belongings to them. When I’m designing an interface, I focus on putting all the UI elements into context for the user. In this case I tried to do context-based packing: In my mind I pictured certain places and situations on my tripI pictured myself sitting in a café or waiting for a proper swell at a surf resort while getting some work done.The following is a minimal list of items I need to do my job properly: laptop, mouse, glasses, sketchbook, pencil, power and world adapters.Next I pictured myself killing time or travelling from one place to another, for example sitting on a bus, reading a book and listening to some music through my headphones.This is the list of items I came up with to keep me entertained during down time and travelling: kindle, mini speakers, headphones, camera and an external hard-drive.Sport is a very important part of my life. I couldn’t imagine to stop working out or running, not even while travelling. My usual routine is to work out with the I am a passionate surfer so my trip includes several stops at surf resorts.My surfing list includes: wetsuit, shorts, bikini, flip-flops, sun protection, micro towel, waterproof cases and a GoPro.Picturing myself at This is my list of trekking-/hiking-items: daypack, fleece jacket, insulated hoodie, rain-coat, trekking shoes and trekking pants.To get a proper night’s sleep is important and picturing myself in a hostel, hotel or an apartment I want to feel comfortable: pillow, sleeping bag, pyjamas.In order to manage my money and payments on the go I needed to think about all the situations where I need money as either cash or plastic: online banking stuff, credit cards, maestro cards, US dollars  Soles, passport and identity card.Of course I have a list of casual clothes that I need on my trip too:What I didn’t put on my post-its was the stuff for my toiletry bag. I always pack those things in the morning before taking off while getting ready in the bathroom. To make sure I don’t forget anything necessary, I put the stuff right back into the bag after using it.Make sure to bring a first aid kit and some basic medication that you know how your body reacts to, in case you get sick.After finishing my lists, I bought a daypack and a backpack. I put my post-its on them and started getting my stuff together.The first month of my trip has already gone by and so far I’m happy with the stuff I packed. There are items which I didn’t use that much, but there are some that I really appreciate to have brought with me. Here is a list of my best picks:The There is no better way to organise your stuff with these awesome Travel Cases  Carriers from Power is always a problem abroad, that’s why I brought a power strip.

Originally intended as a way to help people relax in the bath, these days the neck pillow is a fixture on long-haul flights, and has evolved way beyond the simple inflatable rubber ring. Now there are foam pillows, hoodie pillows, and even neck warmers that look warm enough to withstand a Siberian winter.The Hoodie Pillow might not be very statesmanlike, but even the most rudimentary option could have helped Putin when he cried off the final day of the G20 summit in Australia: Faced with a two-leg, 18-hour flight from Brisbane back to Moscow, he claimed fatigue and said he needed to leave early to catch “four to five hours sleep.”There’s no word if the Russian state’s pimped-out Ilyushin 96–30—the Kremlin’s equivalent of Air Force One—offers a full SkyMall catalog of sleep aids. But it does have a private bedroom where, of course, the president can lay his head and grab a few moments rest. So was exhaustion just a convenient excuse to avoid awkward questions? Probably. But here’s an inconvenient truth: Putin probably is very, very tired.World leaders jet around the world more than ever, living in constant haze of jet lag, expected to pick up and go as soon as they hit the tarmac. Hillary Clinton clocked nearly a million miles during her four years as Secretary of State. Some people are biologically wired for sleeplessness: Margaret Thatcher famously survived on just four hours’ sleep a night. But most need significantly more rest, which makes this kind of big political meeting… well, almost impossible. It’s hard enough to get a group of world leaders in a room, let alone massage all those egos as you try to broker peace, sanctions, or find a way to save the world. Now imagine that half of them think it’s 3 a.m. Skype, anyone?Freelancer for The story you’ve been missing.

Many years ago, I started The Travel File. The rules are simple: whenever I hear of an interesting place I would like to visit — through a friend’s mention, an obscure book, a seventeen-tabs-deep Wikipedia page — I add it to the file.As an example, this is what’s currently filed under “Los Angeles”:And so on, and so on. There are more places, many more places. Entries for most states, most countries in Europe, most major cities. Way, way too much stuff to just hold in my head. A lot of it too obscure to ever find again. There’s a note to take a canoe down the gross Gowanus Canal in New York — because Some of these entries are a decade old, some I added just weeks ago. The messy styling betrays the copy/paste nature of the whole progress. There’s almost no rhyme… but there’s a very good reason.The Travel File is compiled by me, for me. All the things on it mean something to me. There can be no other travel guide that comes even close to being so perfectly I picked up a few habits in life that I can’t live without and I’m grateful for. One example: every time I encounter a word I don’t know, I look it up. (So much easier when reading off of a computer!) Another: After finishing a book or a movie, I always read a few reviews to see what others thought about it, and to learn more and put in context my own experiences.The Travel File is a little habit I came up on my own that I wanted to share with you. Of course, your list would look different. Fewer poor volunteer-run museums, but more great restaurants to eat in. Or parks to check out. Exciting beaches. Places from your favourite books. Locations important in your family’s history.If you’re anything like me, you will enjoy The File immensely. It won’t start paying off straight away. It doesn’t even have to be a file. (I bet there’s an app or two that you could use, but given the long-term nature of this, I like the flexibility and trust I can put in a pedestrian, messy text file.) But one day, a few years from now, you will need to book a quick flight to Los Angeles to renew a visa and suddenly this nuisance of a voyage turns into another great adventure: going to a live comedy show, exploring a new pinball place, and having fun with an old friend.I would’ve remembered to check in with the friend. But the rest? I owe it to The Travel File. Perhaps having one would work for you, too. Let me know!Dana, the guys are going down into the sewer, and Egon thinks there may be a huge surge in cockroach breeding. Wanna blow off this dinner and go with them?

Trust me, it’s addictiveSteve Blank said that the best I think my parents excel in that.I am blessed with parents who are open-minded, supportive, and trust me with life decisions. They don’t blink no matter what crazy things I told them I wanted to do.Well, thing like travelling alone seems crazy for an Asian family.‘It’s dangerous!’, ‘You are a girl!’, ‘You don’t know the language’, and bla bla bla..I finally did my first solo travelling in Nepal and man that was a heck of crazily fun journey that I’ve never expected!I started the journey doing Annapurma Circuit trek in a big group and we had 6 days of tribal life where the whole group trekked and did everything together.The moment I bid farewell to the group, my world was suddenly drop dead silent. I remembered staring at the peak of faraway snowy mountain from the hotel balcony, feeling lonely and empty inside. There were so much going on in me and I can’t even tell anyone how I feel!I just sat in the beautiful morning sunlight and let the feeling of loneliness spread. Then I told myself ‘Belle, you’ve gotta move’. Everything turned better the moment I stepped out.Loneliness is just a mindset that can be turned around by willpower.We don’t usually talk to strangers in daily life because we are afraid of being rejected, ignored, or sometimes we just cant’t be bothered.Start with a smile.I was amazed by the power of smiling while travelling. It is a universal language that breaks down barrier between people instantly and it makes my life so much easier in new places.Talking to strangers is not about courage or to prove something to yourself. It is a life skill where you master communication, empathy, kindness and active listening.I love talking to people for the stories behind them. Everyone has a story; and talking to people from different part of the globe and cultural background gave me the chance to explore many different dimensions of life.I learn about subtle things in human behaviour, local culture, collective consciousness and so much more that you can’t find in ‘Lonely Planet’.From where I come from, security is always a societal issue. Growing up I was told not to talk to stranger and to mind your own business.I need a lot of helps while travelling for things like bargaining for best hotel rate, looking for authentic local food, navigating my way in the city and so on.I decided to put down the guard and believe in goodness in people when I asked for favour.Sometimes I knew it when people tried to rip me off for my tourist status, but let it be. It is just part of the unspoken rule in the tourism ecosystem and it is not personal.Maybe I am lucky, or maybe it’s the people in Nepal; everything turned out fine although I was told that I trust people too easily.Trusting people is a conscious choice, and it is the fundamental of relationship building that we have forgotten.The smile, interaction, and warmth I got from people around me meant a lot throughout the journey. It’s the bits and pieces of kindness that remind me of the beauty of lives.Well, this is not the cliché ‘be who you want in life and live your passion’ thing, it is a golden opportunity for (rebellious) identity reinventing.In this new place where nobody knows me, where I will only stay for a brief period; I can do whatever crazy or stupid things that I want and get away with it!It doesn’t mean that I am going to do bad things or harm people, but I can step out of my comfort zone, make choices differently and see where it brings me.Some days I just wandered on the street and let my instinct navigate me around, and I love this way of living.Just try things that are not the usual ‘you’. If you are a clean freak, try street food for once; if you are an introvert, try talking a stranger everyday; if you are used to luxury travelling, try staying in a hostel to meet new people.A lot of awesome experiences happened because I am willing to explore.When you travel solo especially for a woman, people like talking to you.I met a guy who picked me up when I was looking for a place to drink one night, and I took the chance to trust him and let him took the lead.I ended up in a super cool reggae bar and a rock bar that night. We had good time throughout my stay in Kathmandu.Having a fling is exciting and fun, but you have to be smart to set your own boundary and to know that this is not for real. Love doesn’t happen in 5 days.Enjoy the process, wish each other well, and move on with life.I thought it was ‘that’ easy, but it took me a few days to get over it.So I survived alone in a foreign land, where I don’t know anyone and don’t speak the language.It felt great.I started telling stories and sharing experiences, and my script got better and better each time. Every time I share my journey I learn something new about myself.The experience is like wine that tastes better as it ages.A part of me prides myself for solo travelling, but it matters because of the personal growth that I experienced from the journey. After seeing new people, new ways of living and listening to new stories, the map in my heart expanded.I see things differently and it affects my life decisions.I appreciate every single moment because I know how big the world is and how small my problems are.But it is a journey of self discovery that you are gonna learn so much about yourself and the world. You will be amazed by the transformation in yourself when you ended the journey.I am extremely thankful for the amazing journey that I had, and I can’t wait for the next adventure now that I am hooked to the thrill of going solo.Co-founder @This is a collection for general writing, thinking, and opinions.

First and foremost. Leave your ego home. Be nice to people. Respect local manners. You are the visitor. Don’t expect that you have some special privileges just because you paid a hefty price for the flight tickets. Don’t get into arguments because something cost you half a dollar more than you thought it would be. Don’t try to “be always right”.Integrity is everything. Don’t go around trying to cheat your way or “hack” things to your benefit. Be honest and earn other people’s trust. Do what you promise and don’t promise what you can’t do. If you didn’t understand something, ask if they could explain it to you once more. It helps you avoid many unfortunate misunderstandings while you’re travelling.Always assume that people you meet and come in contact with are treating you with their best intentions. But don’t be gullible. Use common sense and remember that if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.Return a favour. Pay it forward. Take the glass back to the beach bar after you’re done enjoying the beer at the poolside. Leave a tip for the hotel staff when they treated you well. Be of assistance when you notice a situation where you could be helpful. Smile. Little things do matter.Listen and observe. Never judge the habits  customs of other people before you understand the reasons behind them. This rings especially true if you’re travelling in a country that has a radically different cultural background than yours. You can agree to disagree, but never judge.Never leave places worse off than they were before your arrived. Don’t leave your old stuff (like worn sandals) behind when you leave. Don’t litter. Don’t overuse natural resources. If you can help it, don’t leave people unhappy with your behaviour. Instead..If you’ve truly been your best self (and a gentleman), chances are, they genuinely wish you could come come back soon. Be that person. Give your 100% and be awesome. It’s well worth it.✈ Digital Nomad at 

Many of us have taken planes, and have gone to exotic places outside of where we grew up and live.Indeed, the act of exposing ourselves to the foreign and unknown can evoke a plethora of new feelings in us. Sometimes, this experience leads us to new perspective, or even new decisions about ourselves and our lives.More often than not, we return home as the same person as we were before, just with a few more stories to tell and a few more memories to reminisce about during our mundane 9-to-5 job.So, you may ask, what differentiates a trip that leaves us unchanged, from a travel experience that can potentially transform us from the inside out? Well, there is no one way to achieve it, that’s for sure. We are all different individuals, from different backgrounds and with our own interpretation of the world.Having said so, we are all similar in so many ways too. A genuine smile, a simple greeting, or an act of kindness may be all it takes for two persons separated by their backgrounds and languages to relate and connect with each other.To travel is not just to see and to experience, but also to By listening to the stories of the strangers we meet on the roads, about their lives, about their view of what’s happening in the world, about their dreams for the future, we gained not just the knowledge and viewpoint of another human being, but also learn of the value and validity of our own pre-existing views and beliefs.That’s how we gain human perspective I think — not by looking at the endless Himalayan mountain range, or the ebb and flow of the sea by the beach. You’ll never know, sometimes it’s the most unexpected persons who impart us with the most valuable lessons in life.I often hear people say that they travel to feel free again. They explained that traveling helps them escape temporarily from the realities back at home — their old problems, burdens and responsibilities.True enough, being in a foreign land where nobody knows anything about you does have its unique liberating quality. You can be anybody, and you can be nobody. There, I think, is where you find your most authentic self, and then How do you start? Well, rJokes aside, it does take time and a few tries before you learn to open yourself up, not just to strangers, but to the world as a whole. But trust me, once you’ve reached that point, you will begin to see the world in a more fearless and unprejudiced manner.Make your travel different and more meaningful by contributing to the local cause. And no, I’m not talking about By contributing, I mean helping locals who want to help themselves.Some local businesses may be starting up or in the process of renovation and need some funding. One easy way to get in touch with these people — the entrepreneurs, designers or small business owners living/working in the area you’re traveling to — is through online crowdfunding platforms like To skip the hassle of searching through the Want to help a Croatian instructor That’s not only a good way to help somebody, it’s probably the best way to make a local friend too. Definitely an experience that’s worth more than what you fork out of your pocket.Or at the end of your life, you will realise that it’s not the places you have seen, the crazy adventures you have gone through, or the pictures that you have taken that matters the most.It’s the Lastly, always remember:Preview:Jellyfishes are just wet ghosts.

Four months ago, Oh yes you can, everybody can! How? That’s Why? I’m glad you asked :-)Don’t quit your job already, take a smaller step! I’ve found that for most of the people, the ‘alone’ part is the very first hurdle, the very first excuse. ‘Maybe, but give it a try. For a week. Then you’ll know!That’s 99% of the point. I can go for hours on how traveling alone is for everyone, that it can profoundly transform a human-being, its relationships with the world, with the others, with himself. I could do it. This is something that one needs to experience for himself, and I’ve found out that 80% of the solo-traveling experience is trialled in just a week, alone, in a new country. Beware, a long week-end is not enough, the loneliness and freedom just starting to kick-in around two or three days, mixed altogether in a baffling and unearthing feeling. (Get a sense of the experience and you’ll see by yourself how easy and natural traveling alone is. Just like you would test-drive a Tesla before buying it, test-travel a solo trip!Don’t get out of your comfort zone this time, expand it. Get comfortable with new things, like eating alone in a restaurant, or randomly talking to some people around and following them wherever that conversation will lead to. And most of all, get comfortable with When traveling alone for just a week, the amount of planning required is Pick a close-by and convenient country. If you live in Europe, Portugal, Spain or Italy are perfect. Still in the comfort zone, right? It’s still Really, there aren’t a lot of excuses left, are they?Ah yes, holiday plans. The convenient advantage of the solo-travel-week (yeah, it’s a thing now) is that you still can go on holidays with your family, with your loved one or your friends. Only just a little less.If you’re lucky, you’re French and get 5 weeks of paid holidays. 3 weeks in the summer, 2 for Christmas. Book the last week of the holidays, pack a small backpack, and just GO!Tip: Spend New Year’s Eve alone  abroad, you’ll remember it forever!Once you’ll get the taste of solo-traveling, and likely experience all the amazing benefits of it, chances are you’ll also realize that solo-traveling is easy. That it’s for you too, and that having taken that very first step makes the possibility of a bigger one more likely!Travel for a week alone, Traveling for a year :) Previously alchemist at Sharing our ideas and experiences

It is dark, it makes you feel kind of insecure, you can’t see much, and from time to time a creepy crawly hits you, you fling your arms around, it disappears, and you don’t know where it is anymore.You’d wonder how the hell you get yourself into this.It’s scary for sure, to fall for somebody you don’t completely know or understand. It just ain’t as easy as reading a book. You don’t always have a clear bearing of where you are heading to, or how the story would go. You don’t even know where is the north and where is the south, what is right and what is not, anymore.But it’s alright to be afraid, right? To In love, you will feel enveloped by something as Like in a desert, or in love. Like in darkness, or in the arms of a person who has taught you how to trust again.So the next time you find yourself in a desert, or somewhere as foreign or as strangely beautiful, and the face of this particular person comes up in your mind, and you’d hope that he or she is there with you, you come to realize who your love is, and where your next destination should be.Jellyfishes are just wet ghosts.

After living in New York for four years, I decided to leave my high flying but stressful life to go back home (India) and join the entrepreneurship revolution. But before I left the US for good, I thought why not travel as much as possible and try to work to fund my travels. So I packed my bags, gave away most of my stuff and booked a one way ticket to Ecuador. Yes Ecuador. My friends think I am crazy. My parents think I am adventurous. And for the rest of them, they don’t know what the hell I am up to. But as much as its sounds like risky behavior, it feels right.A lot of people want to know why I’m doing this? Especially within Latin America. Why did you leave a well paying job in New York? Why are you looking to go back? Well, for starters there is so much beauty in this continent and its worth seeing every piece of it. The Amazons, the volcanic mountains, a language that’s spoken around half the world that I would love to learn and this fascinating culture that I have no idea about. But, to delve a little deeper:This journey within South America might last forever or end soon. I might fail while trying to build a business. But the good news is I’ll make some new memories, lots of friends along the way and have the satisfaction that I tried and gave it my all.You gotta believe you can take the winning shot and make it.

Traveling approximately 14 hours from San Francisco to Dublin, with a multi-hour layover in Chicago with your three children in tow, is clearly not the stuff dreams are made of. Still, somehow, despite a 2 ½ hour delay in our Chi-town layover, we were all in good spirits. We happily played on our iDevices of all sorts, we had Starbucks, our six year old entertained us by dancing to Thrift Shop and Uptown Funk, shaking his bootie with his darling little earbuds firmly in place.I ran with the kids to the window, showing them the massive plane that would bring them on their maiden voyage across the Atlantic. I seduced my 8-year-old fashionista daughter with tales of the days back in the mid-80s when, flush with air miles from my dad’s job, we’d travel to Dublin first class in airplanes with When we finally boarded, we showed our kids with awe the sheer massiveness of the plane — And then it got real.American Flight 92 was perhaps the first plane I’d ever flown from Boston to Dublin on, back in the mid80s when I was a teen. No, I am not being metaphoric here. It might actually be It was all charming — really, how adorable was it that our seats nonsensically were 34A, 34B, 34D, 34E and 34G, and we were all next to each other? Who the hell needs a C or an H? We must Google this once we get WiFi going!And for $5 the flight attendant (who has to wear a poofy neckerchief and polyester suit even though it’s 2015 and Mad Men is off the air) will give you a set of plastic headphones that go over your head (but are not Beats) and This is all rather amusing. We have our devices, we have our books on our iPads. We can watch our own movies. Hell, my ten year old can make some movies himself on the flight.And then my husband asks the flight attendant, where are the plugs? Oh, she says, well every few rows there are power outlets. Your row doesn’t have one. But don’t worry too much because the power is only available via outlets that are like cigarette lighter power chargers — oh but not like the ones for the cars, ones made especially for planes. And you can only find them in a few stores. You probably don’t have one.No, my husband does not have one. And he is halfway through Rob Lowe’s autobiography on his iPad and does not have time for this. He needs to know what happened with Matt Dillon and Diane Lane.“This is an old school plane,” the flight attendant laughs as she rolls her cart away. Good point. I suspect cash may even still be accepted.On the bright side, our uncharged devices (why bother in the airport? All planes have outlets these days!) leave us room for the meal that arrives. Yes, dinner is included. Dinner.And then the food arrives. And there it is. The same as ever. My ten year old, who is not a lover of any cheese, looks about to faint. Being a native Californian he does love salads, but his hopes are dashed by the despised ranch dressing. Where is some nice Pomegranite — or even just Balsamic — vinagrette? He has to content himself with eating both of our brownies, crackers and rolls (because of course one should have crackers and a roll with dinner, especially if dinner is mac and cheese.)Why? Because if I close my eyes I can imagine my mom and dad, sitting just one row in front of me in the “smoking” section. There was no barrier of course, and we all reeked by the end of the flight. Still, it did help mask that toilet smell that persists on even nicer airlines to the day. Even Sir Richard can’t solve that one.So we ate our cheese, we read our books, sometimes we watched the movie in Spanish just to shake things up. We slept on our uncomfortable pillows until we awoke to the 40 shades of green, with my mom pointing out these colors and my dad singing the song every time. Our flights to Dublin were some of our best times ever, full of anticipation and the breeziness of pre-9/11 air travel.I grew up on those bi-annual flights. I started dreaming of being a writer on those planes. I sometimes spent entire flights pining for some boy, many of whose names I have forgotten. I loved the trips so much that I insisted a portion of our honeymoon included meeting up with my family in Ireland. My husband still jokes with my dad that he didn’t expect to spend his honeymoon with him. Well, he’s not really joking but I think he’s almost over it 12 years later.So I don’t mind that the kids are back in the 80s for a few hours. I don’t mind that I know when breakfast comes it will be as inedible as dinner. I will eat it and be full. And when I go running tuned to my Pandora 80s station in my yoga pant-wearing, granola eating California life, I will rejoice in my 6 ½ hours back in the 80s, a time when we sang sounds about weapons of mass destruction and the world falling apart, but we did it to a cheery beat. And we ate such delicious cheese.Mother. Silicon Valley starter-upper. Champion roller skater. Tone deaf but enthusiastic singer.

By Brandon Smith, One of the easiest ways to improve travel photos is shooting in better light, and the best light is often in the hour Robert Capa, a famous photojournalist once said, “If your pictures aren’t good enough, you’re not close enough.” It’s not just about zooming in with your lens, either. It’s about getting physically closer to people and getting to know them better.It’s also about spending a little time with a stranger before taking their photo. That helps build the trust and comfort that’ll come through in your pictures.Walk up to your subject with a simple wave and a smile to help communicate that you mean no harm. Ask permission to take a photo if they speak the same language as you. If you don’t share a language, try learning some basic phrases ahead of time, gesture at your camera and ask through expression.Of course if someone doesn’t want their picture taken, it’s imperative to respect their wishes and move on — people are always more important than photographs.National Geographic writes that “making great pictures is primarily a mental process.” What makes you want to photograph the person or place? How might you describe it to a friend, and what adjectives would you use? Are there details you can focus on that tell a story?Maybe it’s a dry, arid desert, captured by focusing on the patterns of cracked earth. Or a prairie that’s photographed with the horizon at the bottom of the frame, to help create a sense of the open sky and tranquility. Or maybe it’s the story of a deft artisan, fingernails covered in wet clay as she molds a pot.It’s difficult to recreate the grandeur of a vast landscape in the confines of a picture frame. But one way to add a sense of depth to your photos is to compose them with objects in the foreground that support the scene. It can be as simple as a winding road through a national park, or some rocks to show off the local geology.Keep an eye out for repeating objects, leading lines, and other patterns that can make for interesting elements in your photos.Patterns may emerge in the puddles after a rain, or in the reflections of windows. Anytime you encounter rows of objects like planted trees or columns, be on the look out for opportunities to use them as leading lines to guide the viewer’s eye.If you’re taking photos of people during normal daylight hours, a quick way to get more flattering light is to move the person out of direct sunlight. The light is much “softer” and doesn’t cast stark, unflattering shadows across their facial features. Even better, have someone stand next to an open door or window as the single source of light.Most photographs with great moments aren’t made by quickly reacting and shooting from the hip. Instead, find a scene that appeals to you, and learn to anticipate things before they happen. It might be a loud moment like an outburst of laughter, or a quiet moment like someone passing through a scene.A great way to make more interesting photos is showing people a unique perspective that they haven’t seen before. Look for a way to get above your subject, like a tree or an adjacent building. Or, try laying on the ground to shoot upwards.If you’re visiting a large monument, landmark or natural feature, try including individuals in the photo for a sense of scale. Everyone’s familiar with approximately how tall people are, so it’s a great frame of reference to put things in perspective.A helpful way to draw attention to the main subject in your photo is by “framing” them with other objects in the foreground or background. The frame should have an aesthetic value on its own and shouldn’t detract from your focal point.Your frame might be a literal door frame behind a person, or two trees that flank the view of a mountain. In the above example, a Kiva borrower is framed by an opening in the clothesline (It goes a long way to research the social norms when visiting another country, especially so you don’t inadvertently offend someone. Photographer David Alan Harvey writes, “An appreciation for the history and the culture will help you respect traditions, blend in, and get up close.”Fight poverty with loans as small as $25 at kiva.org

In Brisbane, Australia, I helped Caesars Casino design an iBeacon Scavenger Hunt app. In New Delhi, I helped create one of India’s first point-of-sale mobile payment apps, Hopefully I’m a little wiser for it all.There are two aspects of the Indian culture that universally everyone finds confusing.The wobble (explained in If you ask “Can I have something by 1700 hours tonight?” and they respond with a head wobble, they are saying “I understand you want this by 17h”. But they have not said they will have it done by then.While working in India you may be disappointed when someone misses a deadline. The problem is ‘Yes’ is the default answer. When other cultures might push back and ask for more time, Indian people will say “Yes” and struggle to meet that deadline.Communication is important. Make sure you understand what your Indian colleagues are telling you.Whatever job you’re doing you should be prepared to have unreliable internet. Bad connections, power outages, and spotty wifi are normal.You can still do video calls, phone calls, and back-and-forth messaging, but if you drop off suddenly and don’t reappear for an hour, thats normal.When I first arrived in New Delhi, I had a client call with Chicago. The only phone I had was my Google Voice which required my laptop and wifi. Despite being in an office building and having solid wifi, our 10 minute call lasted an hour with at least 10 disconnects.As soon as your arrive in India, or travel to any new state in India, buy a new cellphone plan! Ideally buy them in the airports ✈, because it will never be easier than buying it there.If they ask for a reference of someone you know in India, ask someone from the kiosks or someone else in the airport. People are very friendly and will gladly help you.Buying a Wireless USB Card requires you already have a cell phone and you have a local resident for reference on your application. For this reason, if you already have a local friend, this will be much easier for you.Look ahead in your schedule to find when you’re going to have important phone calls or meetings. As best you can, figure out where you’ll be and if you’ll have access to an office, hotel or *Starbucks when you’re there.* Product Designer at 

I’ve read many lists online giving “traveling photographer tips” that didn’t appear to be written by real practicing traveling photographers for passionate, aspiring travellers and photographers. Here’s some personal tips learned from my 6 years of travel experience on the road. I hope they work for you:Shot by my partner It’s a common misuse of our artistic skills as traveling photographers to just start firing the shutter once you’ve reached a new destination instead of experiencing it in the first place, understanding it and enjoying it. One way to help you kill this habit is to Scout any given location for a better, fresh angles and moods that gives your photographs a unique, fresh look and feel.Photographing people in far away foreign countries brings some challenges, tension, language barriers, and unfamiliar customs. But when you’re abroad, it’s most important just as at home to gain trust of others and this will allow you to photograph Local people rather than tourists as they really are in their shops, favorite hangouts, and even their homes. Always emit a positive vibe and approach your subjects not as a camera but as a person — Let your smiling face be the first thing they see and ask permission to shoot when you feel it’s right.It’s always a good idea to Learn a few complimentary words like “beautiful”, “wonderful” and “Thank you” to help people feel comfortable and look natural in front of a camera.Check them on my Instagram “Themes” will improve your story-telling skill through the lens and help you focus on what interest you as a traveling photographer and you won’t feel overwhelmed by wanting to capture it all at once.Themes can be created daily with a fresh one everyday or per the whole trip duration and you can change it anytime. So, if you are shooting architectural beauty in Andalusia and the perfect street portrait came up, shoot that too. My point is that when you discover a new place, it’s impossible to absorb everything in a few days and that’s where “Themes” help.If it’s a country you’re visiting for the first time with no photo plans in mind, never pack everything you “think” you need. Take only the essentials, two lenses:One of the most influential and inspiring photographers of all time, A good travel photographer must keep his/her portfolio alive. Keep on traveling, and you don’t have to travel far away for “good” travel photography. Try to bring the beauty of your own local town. Travel to the other side of your city or attend the next music/Art festival to keep your craft and imagination fresh.Enjoyed reading this article?

What makes us human? What differentiates us from every other thing on earth? Smart people say we are human because we have a conscience. Humans have certain unique biological and social traits. The size of our brain relative to our body is one. We were thought to be the only species on the planet to have sex for pleasure. We also hack our environment to make tools no other animal has before us. We think about thinking. We believe in god. We feel guilt. A more morose list if unique human traits- we are the only species to simultaneously lie, steal, gossip, cheat, and wage war. A much more curious answer to the question We are the only species to simply go places for the fun of it. Not for survival, for seasons, or for mating reasons. Ok, sometimes for mating reasons (Vegas!). Point is, humans crave the experience found in places and events (Coachella!). What makes it all the more unique is humans do it voluntarily and on a consistent basis. Animals don’t.Voluntary travel is a gift exclusive to humans. We don’t exercise the gift as often as we should. The stimulating risk of exploration, discovery of something new, the element of surprise, being engulfed in novelty, are all things only humans experience through travel. Every human should make it a priority to explore, discover, and be overstimulated by novelty at least once a year.Think about it — do seagulls ever plan to fly to Vegas for the neon cathedrals? If dolphins could talk, would they confess Hawaii is the place to relax between mating seasons? How about salmon who travel from ocean to freshwater to poop eggs that become babies who must now travel back to the ocean. Are any of them traveling for fun? No. Are you? If not, better start. It would be inhuman not to.—Personal Motto: A.B.L.- Always Be Learning.Traveler | Writer | MarketerArticles for millennials

To the Girl Who Left her Job to Travel,I see your Facebook wall and I’m struck with a deluge of emotions ranging from jealousy to awe. You’re only a year older than me and you’re already living a life that I have always only dreamt of.Sometimes, when I’m feeling down in the dumps, I scroll through your pictures that narrate the anecdotes of the journey you’ve been on. Sometimes, I envision myself in your shoes and for those few moments, much like a child, I’m lost in the adventures of your fantasy world.And then I wonder how many tears are hidden behind that riveting smile. I wonder what consequences were brought upon by the decision to leave everything behind and take the road less traveled. I wonder what and who all you lost along the path while you searched and discovered the new. I wonder whether I’d have the courage to walk down a similar road if given the chance.I wonder whether you’d hold my hand and take me along the next time. Would you?Words. Cinema. Music. Wine. Dance.

Traveling alone sure makes you think a lot. And notice things you normally wouldn’t. My revelation for the day is that I’m a fake.Have you ever noticed when you aren’t acting in the same manner all the time? Your posture may be different or the way you smile might be prescribed depending on the situation at hand. For me, my voice changes.When I’m somewhere where I need to be confident, I can hear the pitch of my voice drop, my words becoming more distinct; it’s like I’m trying to be older. Sophisticated. Not my true self.A week before my wedding, I received a random call from an old friend. It’d been years since we’d talked and it was strange for him to call. He commented on how I sounded. “You sound different. More professional.” I hadn’t realized I was trying to sound like my life was smooth, easy, and in control, but I was.Ok so maybe “fake” isn’t accurate. Perhaps this person with a deeper, calming voice is who I’m becoming. I don’t think of it as a bad thing. Just different. It helps me feel more calm, more sure of myself. Maybe because I am becoming more sure of myself. Ain’t that a thought…Just the musings of a lone traveler.West coaster who loves menus, beaches, and great stories.

It has now been almost two years since I started the long journey that took me from Thailand to my current location, Uruguay, covering some 13 countries on the way. I have come across many different cultures and worked in several extraordinary places, all while corresponding to JotForm users and fixing bugs that arise.Of course, it is not always easy to work as a digital nomad. Aside from changing weather conditions, sudden internet/electricity cut-offs, language barriers and even a coup d’etat, can disrupt my work schedule. More than once I had to study a bug and reply to users in the middle of the night on the edge of a good 3G connection, or during a storm in an underdeveloped island. It also always takes a while to play the beat, and keep the delicate harmony of socialization, concentration and motivation in a brand new place. I need to isolate my work from my surroundings. This experience made me realize that it is quite difficult to endure change and be synced with the work one does, unless one has the support of great colleagues and a brilliant support team that are always available to assist. All this is made possible by JotForm, how we work with heart, and how we communicate.When I travel I generally avoid cities, and follow words of the locals to uncover optimal places of tranquility and amazement. Then it is vital to find some place to rent, so that I have a base to take a breath, and peacefully work and plan ahead. To learn the culture, initially I try to keep things simple and learn the basics of the language as quickly as possible. Then begins the time to really get to know a new culture, and whole spectrum of new flavors.Most fortunately, as I greatly value emotional-connection, I’ve also had the chance to have some close friends along the way. And I’m always thrilled to see brilliant eyes of nice people all around, everywhere, in almost every location. It is a heavenly experience to leave yourself into the hands of people you just met without a doubt. It is also worth mentioning our little companions, often dogs, that I have befriended. All dogs speaks the same language.Once I take a look at the past I see that their friendship and the security they provided kept me away from many discomforts in a challenging habitat. I learned later that some roads were supposed to be dangerous, but was kept safe by my newfound friends, or learned that cats would eat scorpions in a house.I hope to outline the places I visited in my next post with some information I find fun or useful.

We’re making a new travel business. While we have been a bit coy about it for a little while, we’re close to announcing a lot more detail (including a name!), so we will have to ask your indulgence for a bit longer. There a few tidbits we’d like to share with you now.First, there’s this here blog. All the cool kids are using Medium for word-based communications, and we’ve been trying to be cool since at least 6th grade. This is the official place for all the amazing Blade Travel news you can stand. So set the channel wavelengths on your tablomatic screenpads to right here!Let’s start with the name. Blade Travel. It’s terrible, we know. Don’t worry, it’s not the real name of the business. As you may know, Blade is a technology foundry that we started in 2014. We’ve been working with a few consumer tech startups in Boston, but we’ve come across this one idea that we liked so much we decided to foundry ourselves. So the name is just a placeholder, like our last company was founded simply as “Travel Search Company.”What matters more is that we’ve been hiring, designing and coding for a few months now, and have 25 people operating out of our secret lair on the Fort Point channel. Most of those people are designers and developers. We’ve got stuff working, and are learning a ton every day.Since online consumer travel started in the mid-1990’s, it has grown into a huge industry. Travel is the largest category of online commerce, by far. In the past twenty-something years, the technology and adoption of the Internet has changed incredibly. The difference from a desktop PC on a dial-up connection to a mobile supercomputer in your pocket is rather mind-blowing. Online travel since that time doesn’t seem to have changed commensurately. Travel web sites today aren’t We think the time is right for something really new and different, and we can hardly wait to tell you more about it.— Bill, CTO and Cofounder

Life being the unpredictable vixen that is, I recently “downgraded” from a 13” Macbook Air to the new 12” retina Macbook and had the opportunity to take it on an eight-day business trip that involved bouncing around between a number of cities in the United States.Unbelievably, it is also nearly I have a 10” retina iPad that I often carry around in my shoulder bag instead of a laptop. With my old 13” Macbook Air, it was obvious just from the heft of the bag which device I had brought. The new Macbook, meanwhile, is so light that I now have to look inside the bag to remind myself which device I packed. The loss is definitely your gain.Antoine de Saint-Expury once said that a designer “knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”I can’t help but think that Apple designers might have taken that saying a bit too far with the new Macbook. Its single biggest compromise is having exactly one USB-C port on it, serving as both the charger and the lone connector. If you normally charge your phone by plugging it into your laptop, you will definitely be frustrated by this, as no phone cable currently exists that can plug into the USB-C port directly.Apple’s USB-C Multiport adapter is, therefore, a must-have accessory, and at $80 it isn’t exactly cheap. The problem is that you have to choose from the adapter that includes I don’t mind charging and connecting from the same port — nearly all Apple products connect wirelessly these days anyway — but what I It took about 24 hours and several thousand words before I got to workable speed and accuracy with the new keyboard. The shallower butterfly keys have very little travel, so it takes some getting used to. (I doubt I’ll ever hit 100 words per minute on this though — for that, I still need a mechanical keyboard.)When lined up against the 11” Macbook Air, the new Macbook is noticeably narrower even though it has a bigger, far more robust display. The bezel around the screen is aggressively narrow — not as narrow as the Dell XPS 13’s Infinity Display, but it’s definitely narrower than the Macbook Pro’s.Because they packed a full-sized keyboard into such a narrow chassis, there’s practically no space between the edge of the machine and the keyboard. It makes carrying the laptop a little tricky because your thumb constantly mashes against the Shift or Return keys.The familiar backlit Apple logo is no longer a thing on the new Macbook. Instead it’s been replaced by the same reflective logo you see on the backs of iPhones and iPads. I don’t care about this particular change all that much, although it does sound suspiciously like the death knell for the “glowing laptop sticker” industry.If you’re an advanced user, you’ll probably want as much screen real estate as possible, as opposed to large fonts and buttons.The Macbook’s retina display is actually “dumbed down” by default to an effective resolution of 1280x800, but you can opt to bump it up to its natural state of 1440x900 by picking “More Space” from the On my first day with the Macbook, I flew from Manila to San Francisco to Los Angeles to Aspen over a period of 30 hours on a single charge. That’s impressive on the face of it, but I was only ever taking the device out every now and again to peck away at my conference speech, and the battery was brand-new.Over the next few days I was using the notebook unplugged for a good 5 hours at a stretch and never once ran the battery down. It’s probably the perfect device for attending conferences — you’re not going to be doing anything power-intensive like playing games or watching HD video, so in most cases you probably won’t even need to bring the charger.All that said, it’s not particularly stellar in the performance department: I wrote this article and processed its images in Photoshop while running a local web server and switching back and forth to I can’t say I was annoyed by this though — it’s rare that I would want to do all of these things simultaneously and it’s easy enough to just turn off a couple of apps when necessary.The only other travel package that you could potentially compare this to would be an iPad Air combo’d with Over the past week I’ve managed to do a little bit of everything on it — I’ve worked on my web apps, processed photos, watched movies, played games, drafted this essay — and the only moments it really faltered was when I was doing several of those things at the same time.

A short exploration of virtual travelling in game worldsI am fascinated with the idea that travelling in a game world is becoming as rewarding — and challenging — as travelling in the real world. I love the idea that virtual travel is something people would make a specific effort for.I am a real travel fanatic, I spend at least a few months each year out in the big wide world, looking for adventure, learning about new cultures, and finding new perspectives of this crazy planet we live on.It’s enriching, scary, and exhilarating. It’s what living was made for.I am also a big fan of games. I often joke that I lost my teens to the Amiga. It’s true that I spent most of my time back then playing games, hundreds and hundreds of them. And I still do occasionally dip into GTA, Far Cry, or whatever, only to realise… The more games develop visually, and the more they expand in scale, the more this idea of virtual travel holds seems like it makes sense. It’s a logical next step to travel in these vast virtual worlds not because of the missions, but just for the thrill of it, purely for the adventure and the beauty.You see, for me personally games have never really been about the missions or the levels, or about beating the big boss at the end. I’ve always been more fascinated by the little details the game-worlds I was in could offer me, and about the personal journey they offered me.That’s been true from my early days as a gamer, exploring the Tri-Island area of It was true in my late teens, discovering inch by inch every creepy detail on the island of It was true a few years ago when I would spend minutes at a time staring in wonder at the way the sunlight streaks through the wiry, twisted old African trees in And it remains true to this day, Forget about the missions, forget about your score, or if your ammo is low. Forget about the bad guys and all the rest of it.Stop, take a deep breath, and look around you.In fact, the basic premise of the mission is never clearly explained to you, and your short adventure within this gorgeous, mysterious world is really a virtual travelling experience if ever there was one.The trip you take is beautiful, a spiritual experience. The top of the mountain at the end of the game can only be reached after making new friends and meeting many challenges. The feeling of elation when you make it to that top, and the beauty of the scene you encounter, is truly a marvel.So much so that all-through the game there really isn’t any chance of you giving up, or turning back.Another game which for me has this sense of escapism is The magic of creating something and seeing it grow, of caring for this patch of dirt, is a powerful emotional experience. Having a god’s point of view is a profound journey to make.Whether it’s the ice-cold tip of the mountain in Journey, or a gritty graffiti’d side-street in GTA V, there’s no denying that it can be hard to reach the most beautiful, dangerous or secret digital corners in the many wonderful game worlds at our disposal. It’s not hard to imagine once you get there, like in the real world, you’d whip out your phone to post a quick instagram.That a picture taken within a game world could (and should) be posted on real-life social networks. You’ve achieved something, you’d want to Will taking selfies in game worlds, and posting them on your twitter feed, be common place in a few years time? How long before your instagram feed isn’t just real world snapshots? The day someone casually posts their digital counterpart smiling into the camera can’t be far away. Right?In fact, you’ll soon be able to More over, there are a range of great side missions with GTA V involving entirely around photography, selfie or otherwise, and someone even made a mod of doom where More traditionally structured games like Grand Theft Auto V are not any different from the spiritual game Journey. Making it to the top of Mount Iliad to watch the sun set out over Paleto Bay is quite a worthwhile way to spend your limited time.In fact, if you spend your time in Grand Theft Auto Playing GTA V is like taking a holiday from your own life. You travel to another city. But you also inhabit someone else’s body, and a world with different rules to the one you already know. It’s like renting someone’s house in Airbnb, but getting their life along with it.But GTA V for me is just as much a game about wandering aimlessly in the wilderness. I’ve taken boat trips that lasted hours, I’ve done deep sea diving just to follow a school of fish slowly making it’s way way through the plants and rocks. I’ve sat in the woods, watching a deer casually wander past, grazing the tall grass. And just like in the Far Cry series, I’ve marvelled at the sunlight.Traveling in virtual worlds makes you marvel, because the people who build our digital entertainment aren’t just creating guns and cars, they’re building living and breathing worlds. They are truly engineers of magic and wonder. The way the trees grow in You can practically smell the fresh, mountain air in I’m not the first person to have a life-long appreciation for the beauty within game worlds. Have a look at With all this beauty, and all this space, is it crazy to imagine travel guides like the Lonely Planet expanding to include games? Providing tips and hints for places to visit and things to see? I feel like it would be a very natural way for things to develop.I don’t mean a walkthrough. It’s not really about game play. It’s not about completing the missions. But a travel guide that helps you discover the hidden spots of beautiful details, and guides you to the very best panoramic views that one should not missed within a game.I am talking about the things you must see Is it weird to think there’d be a market for that? Not really, there’s already a thriving industry of websites pointing you to all the highlights, and ride-along youtube videos showing you the craziest things you probably missed.Games, of course, also allow you to travel back in time. From joining the crusades to playing with dinosaurs, games have always allowed you to do the impossible. As a gamer, I must say I’ve learned lots from the many games I’ve played. Whether it’s the American revolution, the crusades, or ancient Rome. I feel like I’ve been there, and although the actions I performed within the games I played were an oversimplification of the truth, I am convinced I picked up more in the background details than the history lessons I would get at school.I remember one game especially well — an old strategy game released for the Amiga in 1990 called Playing that game gave me a limited but powerful glimpse the conflict, of Vietnam as a country, and allowed me to experience a small taste of what it must have been like for soldiers on the ground.This makes me think: travelling is also culture.Travelling is also discovering the dark side of a place you visit. It is learning about the worlds’ past. And with that come the gritty, painful mistakes that litter history. When I travel, I do more than sip a margarita by the pool. I learn, I read, I listen. I go to museums, I study people, I learn the culture not just on the surface, but under the skin.Games have always had a stigma attached to them — that playing them is a lighthearted thing to do. We should challenge that idea, playing is not just trivial in intent. Why not create more games that link to our fears, hopes or collective painful memories? Games can transform our way of seeing an event that’s taken place, they can be a powerful medium of learning.And there are powerful examples of this: Shindler’s List is widely viewed and highly regarded and no one feels guilty for watching it. But when game developer Luc Bernard released an online game for children called There have always been feelings of anger in response to the idea of ‘playing’ with a sensitive subject. But games and playing are also unique in how they allow us to be somewhere with all of our energy— they can be used to deal with and understand subjects that might be uncomfortable, painful, confrontational or shocking.So says Ryan Green, creator of the game The great thing about travelling in games, compared to the real world, is that in games you don’t just have to go to the same world you live in. You can travel the universe, discover new planets, inhabit different physical forms.Why limit ourselves to the same old boring planet we live on every single day? Why stick with the same human body we’ve had all this time?When I was young, I read a lot of science fiction. Asimov, Heinlein, Niven, and many other writers magical, frightening and strange creations entered my brain, and got stuck there, feeding my imagination.But only games brought that sense of the ‘impossible’ into the realm of the real. I am not saying games are better than books, except, they kind of are… becoming better… slowly.As the power of code grows, and slowly, the limits of game worlds expand proportionately to the computing power of your machine (as opposed to the amount of data you can put onto a dvd) we’re entering procedurally generated environments that are effectively limitless.An infinite world to explore, to literally get lost in.Playing games of that size is for the real passionate gamers. Finding your way to see the c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate, that — that takes effort. Some people will want a shortcut — someone who can help you skip the hardest parts of a game, and guide you to the sweet spot.Would it be crazy to imagine virtual guided tours? A kind of game-cruise where you’re guided through of the top moments. The must sees. All set to go, allowing you to see the best of a game without having to bother with the rest.Imagine being escorted by someone paid to ensure the best details are not missed, but skilled in the games narrative and challenges to whisk you through without delay.All of this leads us to the the ultimate virtual travelling experience. Virtual Reality is raising heads and getting people extremely excited. With headsets like Oculus Rift and the Samsung Gear coming onto the market, Google Cardboard providing a cheap and easy entry-level option, and the latest development: Microsoft’s Hololens, offering a glimpse of the power of holograms, we’re in for a real trip.If game worlds already have some of us enthralled, then experiencing them in an Oculus Rift or through the Hololens will literally take you somewhere you’ve never dreamed of.Will it be the Oculus, the Google Cardboard and the Hololens, which finally elevate games beyond ammo upgrades and health bars running low? Will it be with those devices that people might take a week off work, just to explore a new game world?It’s early days, and there are many challenges to overcome before this medium is widespread, and before there’s enough of us willing and able to spend many hours at one time making a real journey in a virtual world. But we’re getting there.I asked some designers I know to make the imaginary travel posters you’ve seen above, focusing on a game of their choice. The results are amazing!

Travelling is awesome. Being single in my mid-twenties with a job that mostly requires a stable internet connection, allows me to occasionally board trains and planes and visit distant places I haven’t been to before.Whenever I arrive at a new city I rather avoid the classic touristic hotspots and dive right into the scene. I want to find a good place to grab a coffee, eat something delicious, befriend some locals and learn about their lifes.To me this approach is a lot more satisfying than checking off touristic attractions or taking a sightseeing tour atop an overcrowded bus.I’m there to get enriching perspectives, authentic experiences, unexpected adventures - I want to see the cities I visit through the eyes of a resident. Call my travelling persona “The average travel guide (no matter if in print or as a web or mobile app) is bulky, has over fifteen categories and is focused around events and locations.

Young, career-oriented Americans don’t travel. Sure, we enjoy hard-earned one to two week vacations, short respites from our work, but do we really see the world? As exciting as a vacation to some wonder of the world like Machu Picchu or as relaxing as a stint in the Caribbean can be, we’re here to advocate another kind of travel.Our European counterparts have a different perspective. In some of the most advanced, industrialized nations in the world, from Germany to Israel to Sweden to Australia, traveling in one’s early 20s is a rite of passage. It is viewed as an essential component of personal growth that readies him or her for whatever career lies ahead. Toss aside your material possessions for six months or a year and go explore that big old world with just a backpack and an open mind, they say.Because sacrificing a year that could have been spent in the workforce is often seen as career suicide. At the very least, we Americans view it as a setback to our careers with little to no advantages. That just so happens not always to be true.We’ve spoken to a number of successful people in the American workforce about the effect travel has on one’s career. As travelers in our mid-20s, we have been anxious about this ourselves; therefore, we’re looking for answers on what potential impact this may have in our long-term careers.When we began research on this article, we had the singular intention of proving that travel for anyone, at any point in time, is the right thing to do. Our findings paint a much more intricate picture.The reality is, travel can greatly improve your career if you do it right, or it can hold you back if you don’t. But if you travel with intent, you can find that there is an abundance of career-oriented benefits beyond the pleasures of the experience itself.Rob Gifford, 59 years old, CEO of AIG Global Real Estate InvestmentFor Gifford, his extended travels were life-altering and career-enhancing. It helped him to define who he is and what he wants. He began his trip not knowing what he wanted to do with his life, and only through the clarity and confidence with which travel provided him was he ready to follow a career path that was right for him.The reality is, Gifford entered the workforce in a different era. Maybe this type of career “side-track” was more conventional 35 years ago. Now, we live in a hyper-competitive job market. Perhaps what was true for Gifford is not the case for post-college graduates in 2015. We need to get started on our careers right away and there is just no time for self-exploration. After all, that’s what college is for, right?Parker Spielman, 25 years old, Software Engineer at UberSpielman again reaffirms what we learned from Gifford: that there is some level of personal growth only obtainable by thrusting yourself out of your comfort zone and into a strange and foreign environment. In his case, he learned to connect with people better, which has sharpened an interpersonal skill he has taken with him into his career. In general, on the road, you learns to survive by making the best of your own faculties and resources. We would be remiss not to note that, unlike Gifford, Spielman had a job lined up and ready to go for when his trip was over. This piece of mind must have provided him with a certain level of comfort not afforded to travelers with an unclear career direction.Sean Fischer, 26 years old, Medical Student at Duke University School of MedicineSensing a trend? Fischer is another example of a millennial who only set out to see the world once he had worked out what he wanted to do. He wanted to be a doctor. But his travel experience gave him another layer of insight and perspective that he intends to carry with him throughout his career.But, how can you best utilize your travel experience if you don’t already have a job or grad school lined up? What are employers going to think of your travel experience and how should you best leverage that new wealth of personal growth you’ve amassed and use it to direct your own job search or career path?Christopher Marlett, 51 years old, CEO and Founder of MDB Capital GroupMarlett makes clear that employers may not view your travel experiences as something that might directly benefit you in an interview, but he acutely recognizes that travel helps you define and prioritize what is important in your life, which is foundational to any successful career and demonstrates a real advantage over other job applicants. He also drives home the point that has so far been uncovered: an individual with a unique background and an even more fierce level of focus and determination about what he or she wants with his or her career will shine in any job interview. The unique experience elicits curiosity in an interviewer and gets your foot in the door, but the presence and confidence a travel-enlightened job seeker brings to an interview is what will earn you that position. There is no better way to really get to know yourself and your strengths than to thrust yourself into an unknown part of the world.Travel can help you access unique areas of personal growth and provide you with the confidence and clarity necessary to stand out among job candidates. But when is the right time to travel? Will “wasting time” traveling have a negative effect, casting doubts on your reliability as a potential employee?Keith Geller, 41 years old, COO of JBC HoldingsGeller confirms that employers won’t hire you just because you have done something “different” from other candidates. Building a resume today is a delicate process and your travels should fit like a puzzle piece within the larger scheme of your career development. For career-driven world explorers like Fischer and Spielman, traveling fit into their own trajectories in an ideal way: after college and before the next pre-planned stage. But, admittedly, it is just not that easy for everyone. Most employers won’t grant you It takes a degree of courage to defer graduate school for a year or to delay entrance into the workforce for some time, and this decision comes with benefits and detractions. The fact of the matter is, it is hard for the career-driven young professional to find time to travel. It is not a cultural institution like in many other industrialized nations across the world and that makes it hard to take the plunge.Employers don’t necessarily view your travel experience as a plus. It comes down to you, as an individual. Don’t take this as a recommendation to quit your job and travel for a year if you are already 3 or 4 years deep into your careers, with plans to “figure it out when I get home.” In reality, this might be an unwise move considering the current culture against long-term travel. If you are at this stage of your career, you must find an employer who grants you some time off, get accepted into graduate school and defer, or make sure it otherwise fits into your long term plans. Tread lightly and consider your individual circumstance. Directly after college is the most appropriate and acceptable time to travel, based on modern trends. Having said that, travel is possible for anyone.For us, we spent three years at our corporate jobs before we took time off to embark on the Throughout our journey we have grown in so many ways. Our perspectives have broadened beyond the confines of our upbringing in the suburbs of New York City; on the road, we’ve struggled and adapted to challenges; we’ve been exposed to so many different cultures, learned so many others’ stories and have grown to have a better understanding of our place in the world. We’ve become much more in tune with our own strengths and weaknesses. These are qualities that we will carry with us through life, no matter what we end up doing.All things considered, we can say, unequivocally, that fleeing your comfort zone and dropping yourself into a completely foreign place will lead to short term growth and long term clarity and confidence. It is not the norm in America, so turn that into an advantage rather than a disadvantage. Be the candidate who did something different and show your prospective employer that you are the right person for the job. The ball is in your court. Don’t take too long to think about it. Set the time aside in a responsible manner, find a place you want to go, set a legitimate purpose for your trip and make it happen.

The internet has become a platform for the world to vicariously enjoy the stories of I’ve learned as a (mostly) lone, female, traveller, with a limited budget (sometimes under US$10 a day) After all these items, you may be wondering, is travelling solo even worth it?! Yes, because bad situations rarely happen, and instead you have so much to gain.Going to 100+ places in the past 5 years, I’ve walked down countless small alleys, explored ‘sketchy’ areas, gone home late at night alone, and taken crumbling trains — all with unique personal stories and encounters. Because I am solo, I am open to meeting wonderfully kind people — street-side fruit sellers, hostel receptionists, friends of friends for a place to stay, free rides. It is an incredible I’d love to hear your stories, tips, and advice to help women stay safe while going out to explore and experience the places and things they want!I am a traveller, blogger, people connector, and content aggregator.

Yeah, it’s possible, but sometimes this one feels a bit like douchey code for: “So what is it you’re actually “I can teach English,” I answer.“Everyone here already speaks English.”I see her point. She looks through my spotty resume some more.“What are all these gaps? What did you do for six months between Japan and Spain? And again for four months between Korea and… Really? Korea again?”Um…“Finding myself?” I try.She quickly jots something in her folder.“We’ll see what we can do.”And I never hear from her again.Or it could make you socially awkward. When you live in a foreign country and everyone sounds like a grownup in a Peanuts cartoon — The good thing is nobody thinks you’re a freak for the animated facial expressions and spacey, zoned-out quality you emit. They just think you’re foreign! Then they take you home for dinner, make you sing a song, and cut off a lock of your yellow hair as a keepsake. Heck, that’s not weird. They’re foreign!The worst is when you come home, and you’re no longer sheathed in a protective condom of foreignness. The next thing you know you’re in the checkout line at Albertsons. You glance at the magazine rack and notice that you’re somehow eight American Idols behind. What ever happened to Taylor Hicks? You place your ice cream on the moving belt thingie — your vocabulary has atrophied while abroad — and continue a lively conversation with the people in your head.“How are you today?” asks a voice from not in your head. It belongs to the checkout guy. Why is he talking to you? What kind of shady shit is he trying to pull? You should probably say something. Anything. But you feel like Ralphie when Santa asks him what he wants for Christmas. The whole situation is awkward, except that it’s not. It’s just you. You are awkward.You want to trek through virgin rainforest, visit indigenous peoples, and pretty much experience a way of life that no longer exits in the modern world. Who wouldn’t? It’s time travel without all that pressure of inadvertently fucking up the space-time continuum. I’ve had I once visited a hill tribe deep in the jungles of Thailand. There were satellite dishes attached to all the huts and native teenagers playing on smartphones. Our guide invited us, the huffy and puffy red-faced tourists, to take photos with some of the locals dressed in traditional costume over their traditional jeans, T-shirts, and Nikes. They kindly charged us for this privilege. Next a little girl approached me and tied a hand-woven (in China) friendship bracelet to my wrist. Aw, cute. She also wanted money. Then all her friends wanted money. Then a mob of child hustlers broke out, and they all knew the words to Kesha (previously known as Ke$ha.)Later over a lunch of green curry and sticky rice some jackass complained that the beer one of the local guys carried in on his back from the nearest village a thousand miles away wasn’t cold enough. Weren’t we there to embrace a traditional culture? We didn’t travel all this way for refrigeration and other modern day marvels. Seriously, what is wrong with people?Okay, that jackass was me.Except when it’s boring. I was bored in Borneo. If only I could’ve procured that orangutan sidekick. While it is true that Borneo has much in the way of adventure travel, from scaling the peak of Mt. Kinabalu to cruising the Kinabatangan in search of horny large-nosed monkeys, my time was mostly spent working in the “big” “Kota Kinabalu’s a great town!” travelers passing through would say en route to better places. Their time in KK — as us denizens called it — consisted of one night getting plastered off Tiger beers at the Irish pub on the waterfront. The next day they were gone, and I was back at the pub.

Heading out to sea with a Nicaraguan fishing crew at 4am.Building a yurt with a family of nomads on the Mongolian steppe.Cruising around town looking for grub with a Guatemalan mechanic.In the past year we’ve driven through over 25 countries. We have a lot of travel highs and a lot of travel lows, but wherever we are we really try to dig into the local scene. And we mean scene literally. We’re We used to think these amazing situations were happening because of our camera. But we’ve realized that there’s actually a formula to making deeply authentic experiences happen, and the camera isn’t part of it. You don’t need a video camera to travel like we do.Here’s how we approach any travel scenario:No excuses — whatever country you’re in, whatever language you’re speaking, the first word you learn is hello. No conversation starts without a hello, so let it come from you.We’ve always been amazed that “people in X country are so much friendlier and happier to talk to us than they would be in New York!” But that’s because we’re likely throwing out a lot more hellos than we would be in New York. Strangers don’t really say hi to us in NYC. If they did, we probably would say hi back!This is critically important. If you’re receiving a service, dealing with border guards, asking for something, anything — everyone has a name and you’ll rarely meet a person who won’t tell you theirs. This is the quickest way to turn any encounter from transactional to conversational, and get human to human with someone in very different shoes than you.By traveling you are inserting yourself into someone else’s world. You can get a surface idea of what they’re up to, but why not ask questions to get yourself a little deeper? How long have they been doing that thing they’re doing? How long have they lived here? How has the area changed in their time here? Do they have kids? What hopes do they have for their children?Politics, money and religion are generally off limits when you’re home, but if you’re having a good conversation, don’t be afraid to get out of your conversation comfort zone. Just don’t be surprised if they reverse the questions on you.A lot happens before and after you enter a scene. If you’re in a restaurant, why not ask where the food comes from? If you’re dealing with a mechanic, why not ask what he does in the evenings? Ask to see how they’re cooking your dish in the kitchen, or if you can visit the market with the chef in the morning. Don’t turn down an invitation to enter your new friend’s house to meet his or her family.People often think their day-to-day lives are boring. Be their most interested face of the day. Remind them that what they’re doing is the most fascinating thing in the world to you in that moment. Your attention is the greatest gift you can give someone, so pay attention to people like they’re telling you next week’s winning lottery numbers. Don’t take out your phone to take a picture until later.Laugh. It helps everyone relax, and brings out the kinder, more open side of people. Even if you can’t speak the same language, laughing is universal.There’s a common sentiment that you should give more than you take in life. You’ve made yourself more vulnerable than usual by venturing out into an unknown place and you’ve been rewarded with a truly authentic experience with some locals that had no real reason beyond basic goodness to give you the time of day. You know your host better than most visitors now — what small token or act would be most impactful to them? The answer is usually not money. Give it some thought. The more practical the better.You may by now have noticed something about all these tips — Out adventuring, come join! | Just figuring the best way to be you.

Before I left, a couple times it came up in convesations that I was coming to Greece for 3 weeks. Statistically people do not travel solo for that long, so the range of responses I got was very interesting to me. There were mainly 3 broad categories of responses:I’m most curious about this response, what specifically keeps people from it? Sometimes it’s logistics, sometimes it’s the expense, but it seems more often than not it’s fear. Fear of the unknown is one of the greatest hinderance to having what you want in life. Social fears can be especially crippling.We are (unfortunately?) social creatures, doomed to a lifetime of worrying about how we fit in to the world around us, how to be acceptable, our place in society, etc, etc blah blah blah. This has its uses evolutionarily, however beyond the common sense scenarios, it hinders more than helps these days.When traveling by myself, every once in awhile, there’s an amazing angle and I want to get my camera to capture it. The immediate response in my head is — “OMG I’m going to look SO stupid doing this!” After realizing thatApplying this principle to other situations is even more powerful and freeing. Walk up to random strangers in line and make new friends with interesting people. Start random conversations with random people at random events where you don’t know anyone.It’s the subjective, undue, self importance that drove us to think that anyone was even paying attention! The sooner we realize this innate self-centeredness and its ridiculousness, the more free we are to be ourselves and experience all the possibilities. I do believe that with this freedom I think as a woman, this reaction is especially prevalent. We are basically told that our value as a person is directly correlated with our relationship status.Relationships are a beautiful thing because within secure and healthy relationships, individuals are able to share some special bonds with another- whether it be friendship, romance, brainz-connect (yes it’s a thing!), or any combinations of which is amazing. They are very special moments that make us grow as individuals. Romantic relationship status evaluation, however, is overrated to be honest. This inexplicable need for social validation through relationship status is annoying at best, and oops-you-just-destroyed-your-life at worst.Relationships don’t make us whole, solitude does. I believe that it is only when we can be alone with ourselves that we can have genuine relationships with others and not just using people to “fix” the loneliness. We don’t fix loneliness by being with people, we fix loneliness by being comfortable with who we are, finding ourselves, and bringing that to who we connect with.Introverted — that word doesn’t mean what you think it does…most people use that word to mean “really shy”, “socially incompetent”, “hates people” — so no, none of the above. It actually just mean— you recharge by being not with people — which is true.Being introverted let you do things like: not talk to anyone for days and be completely happy and content, make friends with a couple locals immediately after you land, strike up random conversations with random people at random places because it’s interesting.Also, a bunch of smart people are saying Traveling alone lets you experience a type of social freedom most people never experience in their entire lifetime. Many of the things that you think is “normal” at home is really not, and it forces you to realize that not everything we’re used to is “the right way”. Conventions and preferences are just that — personal, subjective preferences and conventions.So get out there and give it a try! Not only will you experience a whole new type of traveling, you may end up seeing a whole new world when you come back too. 🎉VP of Engineering 

I’ve heard it so many times that I’ve lost count by now: “But that of course isn’t true.I’ve been traveling solo for a few years now (not because I dislike people or anything like that, but usually because I don’t want to wait around for someone to travel with me and because I kind of LIKE to be on my own and have the freedom to do what I want when I want) and I’m still here to tell you about it.Yes, traveling solo as a woman IS a different experience than traveling solo as a man — I won’t deny that fact. As a woman, you DO have to be more careful and more vigilant in some cases. You have to be more aware of how you’re dressed, who you trust, and how decisions you make could affect your safety.However, this doesn’t just apply to traveling. In a world where violence against women is a growing problem, being careful and vigilant is something women just DO. It’s certainly not confined to traveling.Which brings me to my point: I’ve already written about the So here are five of the main reasons why I’m NOT afraid to travel alone:One of the articles I was quoted in recently was a post about the “most dangerous” places for women to travel. But the article quoted crime/violence statistics for countries like India, Turkey, South Africa, and Mexico, and then tried to suggest that these same DOMESTIC violence numbers automatically made those destinations dangerous for women to travel to.Which is just silly.The United States has some of the highest violence rates in the world, and yet I wouldn’t consider it a dangerous place in which to be a tourist.We see so many movies and read so many sensationalized headlines that we’ve become conditioned to assume that the world “out there” is a scary, dangerous place. But guess what? It’s really not.As I mentioned earlier, you DO have to travel differently when you’re a woman. But my rule of thumb is this: This means that I’m not going to go wandering in an unfamiliar place on my own at night, or take rides with complete strangers, or go off without telling someone where I went, or get drunk or do drugs or do anything else that would put me in danger no matter where I am.I also have learned to be aware of my surroundings and to trust my gut. If I find myself in a situation where I feel uncomfortable, I do what I can to remove myself from it. When you travel solo, you are your own best defense.You should do this no matter how you’re traveling, but doing your homework about a new destination is especially useful when you’re traveling solo. Before every trip, I do a little Googling and read up on things like cultural norms, common scams, and how I should dress as a tourist.When traveling to more conservative countries, I make sure to pack more modest clothing. Not only does this make me feel more comfortable since I know I won’t be offending anyone with what I’m wearing, but it also tends to cut down on the catcalls and other unwanted attention.Reading up on common scams is also a must for me — it helps me pinpoint potential scammers before they have a chance to fool me, and it also makes me more confident when going somewhere new. For example, I read about the “bracelet scammers” that hang out near Sacre Coeur in Paris, and therefore knew to keep my wrists and arms out of reach whenever I walked by them.Doing my homework helps me fit in to new cultures better, and also makes it easier to be vigilant without being paranoid.Even though I wouldn’t advise you to wander off alone with a complete stranger, people you meet on your travels ARE, for the most part, going to be helpful rather than threatening. As a solo female traveler, I’ve had countless experiences where I’ve actually had complete strangers looking out for me on trains and subways, helping me stow my bag or making sure I knew which stop I needed to get off at.Just as the world isn’t an inherently dangerous place, people are not inherently evil. I spent a lot of time being very suspicious of anyone who would strike up a conversation with me for about the first year I was traveling alone. Until I realized that those people were just trying to be friendly.Yes, it’s important to be careful and to always trust your gut. But And, when you do, you’ll learn that, at the end of the day, people are more similar than different, no matter where they live, what they look like, or what they believe in.Lastly, if I ever DO find myself in a destination where I don’t feel completely comfortable on my own, I know that there are always ways to ensure that I’m NOT alone.I often book small group tours in places that I don’t feel confident about visiting solo. I go on day trips with other tourists. I stay in hostels or guest houses where it’s easy to meet other travelers and join in on group activities.There’s no need for me to be afraid, because I’ve learned that traveling solo doesn’t necessarily have to mean being alone all the time.I realize that solo travel will always be one of those things with a mysterious, often-misrepresented air about it. But hopefully this has helped reassure you at least a little bit!Im just a small-town Ohio girl trying to balance a normal life with an unquenchable lust for travel. See what adventures I get swept away in next!

Traveling AloneTraveling alone is a trip. I love being totally unfettered, going anywhere I want to, talking to anyone I care to, learning anything that catches my interest, or just sitting down by the grass, in any city I can possibly get myself to. So far I’ve been alone in London and Savannah, and I breathed those cities into my heart in a way that I wouldn’t have otherwise. But always when I travel alone, I miss my family and friends ridiculously, and I don’t fool myself — I know that it is only because I am lucky enough to have them in my life that I can go off and explore.Some people have odd reactions when they see that I am (apparently) normal, yet I actually choose to travel alone sometimes. It’s a writer thing, I try to explain as an excuse, embarrassed. Even in my own mind, I start listing my friends, the people I love that wanted to come this very weekend, just to assure myself. No, I’m not a loser. I’m an…Artiste. A cool loner. Like…John Wayne. Like Emily Dickinson. Like…like…the Unabomber? Oh shit. No, no, like Greta Garbo! Yes, that’s it. Beautiful (haha yeah right) and alone.Sitting alone in a crowded restaurant, I find waiters are overly kind. I get asked directions a lot by other normal tourists who assume I must live there, because why do I walk so fast, and anyway, where are my people? Some guys try to hit on me, while others think, “what’s wrong with you, then?”I become a safe person, an anonymous shoulder to cry on or to lie to, and I hear a life story that breaks my heart. It seems untrue, which breaks my heart even more. Please, I think. Please, please make the suffering stop. It’s hard to face that not everyone knows my kind life, or has the kind of tools of survival that I have been given.But I can do something about some part of it, no matter how big or small, I know this from my volunteer work with my church and other organizations. I find myself sitting by the river trying to offer assurance to a crying stranger, searching for the magic combination of words to pull her back from wherever she is.Then I realize it is not what I thought but still, some combination of forces in the world put that girl and me next to each other in the same city at the same time. I vow to train more when I get home so that I can effectively help. I feel like a wannabe guardian angel as I walk down uneven streets, trying to make sure the girl arrives safely in the dark, then laugh at myself when I realize there is no one in this strange city to make sure I get home safely, and that I am every bit as vulnerable as she is late at night, in this seedy part of town.But oddly, I don’t feel vulnerable. I feel invincible. Not stupidly so in a way that I would throw myself in the face of danger. Just accurately so. I feel like I can create my own world. I am even responsible for the people around me, and what they do or say to me. I can help. It concerns me if they are not doing well. I do as well or as poorly as I can create the world. And I know this is the truth. And not any other.I get the perspective of looking out at the world, and calling it mine. And I realize what I am doing when I travel: I am just going somewhere and looking and filling myself up — with sight, with beauty, with color, with people…with havingness. I feel such a relief. I came on this trip because my heart was broken in more ways than one; once again, I thought, not big enough to hold. I drive all this way and finally own the fact again that I can make my own heart.Heading to my hotel, I smile back at the unusually polite party guys that wish me a good evening, like they see something in me deserving respect, that leering would not do. I am not thinking I want to be alone, though. I am anxious to get on the phone and answer back the people that I like and love, even my heart-breaker who is more than that, so much a friend.I can’t wait to take my next trip — but not alone next time. :) Because….sharing is caring? Yes, seriously. Because all the beauty and juice of life are out there to experience, and I want everyone to experience it too.

Kicking off a series of stories from inspiring entrepreneurs and creatives in our community and beyond, we caught up with Ricardo, CEO of It all started when Ricardo quit his corporate job in 2014 to start freelancing and allowing more room for travel. Together with a few friends in similar situations, their first destination was set: South America. While working and travelling together, they started The One or two people are usually responsible for arranging the logistics to ensure business operations run smoothly.For the startup team to travel and work together harmoniously, a few rules are required! Not staying in the same hotel, or even the same neighbourhood, is the first. ‘We’re all friends, but it’s also important to have the option of private time.’ says Ricardo.With the team being very close, Mobipium has created a unique company culture but, sure, there are also conflicts. Like in any other company, those issues arise every now and then. Unlike many other companies, however, Ricardo pays very close attention to resolving them immediately.By being flexible and reflective about their actions, the team is learning how to make this lifestyle work as they go.How long Mobipium will continue to travel is unclear. ‘We’ll travel together as long as it is manageable for us’, says Ricardo. ‘We’re now tackling Southeast Asia, then we’ll see where the journey will take us.’What fascinated us about the Mobipium team is their passion to travel and discover the world, while maintaining a strong focus on pushing their business forward. Their story and experience demonstrate how, with determination and creativity, it is possible to combine the dream of working and travelling, even as a team of eight.To the Mobipium team we wish all the best, and are very much looking forward to seeing how their story continues.An easy way for startups and freelancers to find the right workspace.

I began my professional career in the Middle East. As a young female analyst traveling through Kuwait, Syria, and Afghanistan, there was no way to not feel very And I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. Men and women — in aggregate, not individuals — behave differently and want different things*. Whether these differences are innate or learned, whether they’re positive or divisive, they exist.With this in mind, earlier this summer we took a deep dive into We teamed up with data scientist Among US-based travelers, men disproportionately favor destinations in Asia. 40% of destinations that are more popular among men are Asian countries (vs 5% for women). Top countries for men are China, the Netherlands and Japan.Women have much more interest in Europe: of the cities more popular among women than men, 60% are in Europe (vs 20% for men). The top countries more preferred by women are Greece, Italy, and Indonesia (and by Indonesia we mean Bali).For the purposes of this post, we’re looking at a sample of 32,947 US-based users of Hitlist for whom we have travel data. While there are considerable more males (27% vs. 16%), the females tend to use the app a bit more actively. On average, women select 7.4 countries as potential destinations, while men only select 6.3. Interestingly, men and women claim to have been to approximately the same number of countries — 2.Among cities more popular with men than women, 43% are in the US, and they tend to be major domestic cities such as New York and Washington, DC. You can see the top 21 destinations for men Only 17% of the cities more preferred by women are in the US, and they tend to be less trafficked destinations like Nashville and San Jose. The top 24 cities female travelers prefer are visible The top 5 domestic cities more popular with men are New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Boston and Las Vegas. Women have more interest in Maui, New Orleans, Honolulu, Nashville and Kauai.Internationally, the top 5 cities more popular with men are Amsterdam, Hong Kong, London, Tokyo and Berlin. Women are setting their sights on Bali, Mykonos, Athens, Nice and Cancun.How are we using this data at Hitlist? Since we’ve noticed that women are more active users, we’re making an effort to introduce more content that caters to this demographic. We’ve added more coverage of off-the-beaten track highlights like this list of inspiring, slightly edgy Every Hitlist user receives personalized alerts that we think will appeal to him or her most. In the absence of any other data, we can factor gender into the equation, but as soon as we know a bit more about what you’ve done and where your interests lie that will take precedence.For users that haven’t given us gender data, we’re able to infer probable gender based on their user activity, and make an effort to tailor our alerts accordingly.We make no value judgments on who should go where, and don’t mean to imply that any of these cities are more girly or brotastic than any others. We love getting our users to their dream destinations, wherever they may be.For a fuller breakdown of the numbers, head over to Mike’s awesome Nomad, nerd, travel evangelist. Founder 

Mathias and myself have been working in Berlin for the last couple of years. Right between internet startup land and the border of web design agency country. We’ve both turned 30 in Berlin and were on a pretty good vibe with the city in and around our jobs.But something started to feel off after a while. Don’t get me wrong, I did love the jobs I’ve been working in and it was also not the hours or the mess that you’d have to put up with every day — in all honesty the startup chaos was one of my favorite battles to fight!Anyway, we started to lay out the possible options we had apart from working a day to day job. And of course we both loved the idea of starting our own business. Like every guy always wanted to buy his own bar … But even Berlin can get small after a while and you start to wonder what the real world outside the lets-invest-millions-in-every-ridiculous-startup-idea-bubble™ might be like. On the other hand, the idea of just permanently moving to another city didn’t instantly appeal to us either because of questions like:All pretty breathtaking … At least from our point of view.So in the last couple months of 2014 we had already decided to go traveling for a while in Australia. We even went that far to quit our places and jobs just to have the option to travel as long as we’d like to.I started to dig around for a bit to see what other people are doing to earn money while traveling and of course there’s stuff like work and travel especially in Australia. Picking fruit and working on farms and such. And even though that might be a good option for frustrated banking consultants who finally want to work with their hands or whatever, I continued to dig. And what I found was an apparently rapidly growing community of people who tag their Twitter posts with ’#nomads’ or ’#digitalnomads’.Well I guessed that there must be people traveling with their laptop and who work from everywhere, but what I didn’t see up to that point was that this whole movement is not only about freelancers or short time contractors. There were guys working for Airbnb in California, moving to Bali for a couple months because they had something to concentrate on and their employer did even support their choice — and in some cases even agreed to send a couple team members with them!That’s been the headline of a recent Of course there are situation in which you’d rather be sitting in front of your client so sort things out in person, but then again there’s also lengthy periods of time that require inspiration and concentration and those can basically happen anywhere in the world.We did go to Australia, to the far side of the planet and just traveled around. To start things off we came up with an In our case — and by all means that’s probably not the universal starting point for everyone else — we launched this website while visiting an old friend we hadn’t seen since Uni. He’s a photographer and could, as a matter of fact, use our help designing his corporate identity. I traveled to Bali for a couple weeks, ran into another friend from Berlin who set out to do the same thing as we were. He had been on a Bali just a couple weeks longer and met a guy from San Francisco who was running an online store, selling flip flops, made from re-purposed auto tires. He started working with us to re-design his storefront. Other random things can happen on the road too. Apart from online business we stumbled into this group of artists who were on the road for a full month, to run a series of community festivals and were keen to hire us as video projection crew. Through that Mathias even rediscovered his love for So we’re actually in business! And in our case all the pieces kind of just fell into order, because we were lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time. For now of course… We’re not too sure where this ship is going to turn next or if it might hit a rock, but then again, that’s the whole point of it.Apart from talking to people we knew personally, we also took a deep dive into the world of social media and tried our luck on In any way, we’re sure that talking to other people about your idea and sharing insights in the community can be very helpful to strengthen the remote work trend.We’re currently on our way to Karijini National Park in Western Australia which is quite a long drive inlands from the west coast. Just the other night we sat down in our van, opened up a beer from the 12V powered fridge and decided that we should try and see if anybody would maybe want to buy prints of the photos we’ve been shooting. Produced on high quality aluminum dibond, finished with a 3mm acrylic glass and shipped right to your home. I thought to myself: “I’d buy one if they’re pretty and not totally over priced!”. So we designed our store front, setup a stripe and PayPal business account and connected that to shopify. I for one was actually surprised how easy it is to launch an online business these days …No idea if we’re even going to sell just one picture (which was not bought by my mom ;) but if we do, we’ll be super happy to earn a few bucks with something we love doing.After the first half year we believe that our new business model can work and that we can create a business that is not bound to any locality and which can provide for our future.So again and to conclude: remote can be the future. Work on communication skills, get a couple solid first references from clients who are willing to pledge for you and most importantly, put everything you have in it and don’t stop before you reached your goal. It might get rough at times but I’m writing this post while Mathias is driving through an absolutely stunning landscape in the middle of Australia and I think to myself: “It’s definitely worth taking a risk!”This story is for the community of Digital Nomads because it might help someone — and for everybody else because it might inspire.Yukon ho!Communication Designer, Web Engineer - working and living on the road as a #digitalnomad.

How I managed to travel this much? That’s a question I’ve been asked more than once…Today I’m going to tell you a really wild story. Chronologically from where everything began — I promise.Traveling has always played a central role in my life. It was always something that deeply motivated and fulfilled me. But, traveling is only a puzzle piece in the game of life and traveling alone won’t make for a happy person, there’s actually a lot more to it — which is something I found out the old school way, called “learning by doing”.Part of the story is my “classical career path” which I completely threw over board in the end. But let’s start from the beginning.Today I’m going to let you in on how everything started and what I’ve learned along the way! I hope you’ve brought some time! Sit back and enjoy!I grew up in a small town in the Rhineland near Cologne-Bonn with my brother Daniel who is 7 years older than me and my two travel-crazed parents. I enjoyed an idyllic, happy childhood in the countryside. During my high school years I noticed that I was very hands-on oriented. I didn’t see the point in learning stuff that no one directly uses in everyday life. And that, in my opinion, applied to quite a few of my classes.Luckily my parents aren’t the kind of people who tell their kids: “You have to go to college if you ever want to get into a decent career”. So, after 10th grade I switched to a three year secondary school of economics where, after completion, I received something called a “Fachabitur”, a college-qualifying secondary-school diploma, while at the same time receiving training to be a Foreign Language Assistant in English and French. Not only was I much more successful here than at my previous school, I also gained a ton of confidence when it came to taking things into my own hands. My training was designed so that way I could enter the work force right after getting my diploma.At this point I took my first big individual trip with my then-boyfriend — to California! We took a car from Las Vegas through L.A. and San Francisco (along highway no.1) all the way to Sacramento in order to visit a friend of his who was doing a semester abroad at the German electronics and engineering giant “Siemens”.Nonetheless — I didn’t feel quite ready to get into the job. But I also didn’t want to do any more studying. I didn’t even know what to study at that point and was afraid to be forced to learn stuff again that I wasn’t going to use in real life. Organizing a trip, that’s something that I liked doing.My dad, who was an avid reader of the Cologne newspaper, one day showed me an employment ad — an international tradeshow corporation was looking for people to join their team at the “Koelnmesse”, a big German event company. Tradeshows  Events. Pretty cool, I thought, and thanks to my diploma in economics I sailed right through the hiring procedure.The “A year before I was supposed to finish my training they were already trying to get me to commit to a marketing team that I was supposed to join after my training was finished. I wasn’t exactly happy about that. There were still other departments I’d planned on getting to know. Worried that they wouldn’t offer me a job after I finished training with them, I surrendered.So, after my time as a trainee came to an end, I found myself holding down a permanent project assistant job at tradeshows and events concerning all things: “Home, Garden  Hobbies”.I was in my early 20’s, had my first permanent job and my first apartment. It didn’t take long for me to grow bored with what I had. Even though it’s nonsense, I thought that if I didn’t immediately go out and do something, I’d still be sitting here 40 years from now.Traveling. That’s what inspired me and made my eyes glow. One of my girlfriends, who I had known from my training, and I went to Egypt for a week. With a ship over the Nile river! What a landscape, I tell you…I found myself being inspired by our 26 year old travel guide on the ship. She had been cruising around the world on various ships. My friend and I started to have these crazy fantasies of traveling around the world.No sooner said than done. Hardly back, we in fact started planning for our trip and I can’t tell you enough how much I enjoyed doing so. Of course everybody in my down-to-earth environment thought I was crazy. After all, I had such a great job and surely a great future ahead of me.Goodbye party that my friends put together for meSo, I just easily dropped everything? Not quite! A small, cautious part deep inside of me said: Stop! What are you going to do when you get back? What if you can’t find another job?In order to calm myself and those around me I signed up for classes at a college in Düsseldorf upon my return — I was going to get an MBA, majoring in tourism. What a fabulous plan! If I was going to get an MBA, I thought to myself, then at least with an emphasis I could get excited about!But first we were off on our trip around the world. We had purchased an around the world ticket to Thailand, Australia, Chile and Argentinia. For Australia we applied for a working holiday visa and I found myself helping out with the tomato harvest at a vineyard and working at the bar at a backpacking hostel at Cape Tribulation. I have tons of real pictures from this whole trip but no digital ones.Nonetheless, here are a few of my favorites:Thailand — Hiking through the jungle in the northern part of ThailandAustralia — Amazing! The “easy going lifestyle” made quite a lasting impression on me!Argentina — since that was the „end“ of the trip, I unfortunately only have very few pictures. But who feels like taking non-stop pictures for 6 months anyway?After this trip I was of course even more so infected by the backpacking virus, and for the first time asked myself how to connect my passion for traveling with my job. Because traveling alone just wasn’t going to work… after all, it did require money.Maybe I could work on a cruise ship? I felt like I was slowly starting to go crazy, but eventually made a decision to go to college after all. It couldn’t hurt to get even smarter, right?!After college I found myself at the same crossroad as before: Go back to working? How can I find a fulfilling career that ties in with my passion for travel?In order to mull things over, I once again decided to set off, this time all by myself to Panama and Costa Rica. Where did I get the money from?Costa Rica — Did I really used to smoke? I can’t even remember …Escaping the Turtle-Camp in Costa Rica and driving to Panama — Bocas del ToroAfter my return one thing was for sure: I needed a job! This time I actually went through with it and sent my application as Shore Excursion Manager to several cruise ships. I thought that was way cooler than working in entertainment/events on the ship, after all I wanted to be able to go on land too.Fully committed I submitted my application and was able to land an interview.Of course I also I applied to other jobs at the same time. During this period of my life I spent a lot of time focusing on myself, trying to figure out what I liked, what I wanted to do and in what type of field I wanted to work in.Then, I specifically went looking for these types of companies and jobs trying to gather as much information as I could from people who were working in that field.Here I organized our appearances at tradeshows and events like the graduate convention, connecticum, academia, “Zukunft Personal” (a German tradeshow specializing in Human Resources) and other events as well as built up an online academy and hosted a series of seminars. The good part: I always got to be on-site.The job was extremely versatile, handling the events section also meant advertising the events online on the homepage and though banner advertisements, designing flyers, posters and brochures or sales material, copywriting emails, approving press releases, ordering advertising materials etc.The company also had a flat hierarchy and was pretty unconventional, so it was easy to bring in and implement your own ideas. It also helped that all of my colleagues were a little on the crazy side — and therefore a great fit for me.For a long time the job was perfect for me and also challenging. I was regularly on-the-go and most of all learned a lot about how an “online company” works. But of course I didn’t think 4 weeks of vacation was enough for my passion for adventurous LONG DISTANCE TRAVELS…At that time I was still living in my beloved 4 person shared apartment in Düsseldorf, the same one I had already lived in during my college years. We always had lots going on and participated in tons of activities in our spare time. It was an awesome time.I had some really great friends in Düsseldorf that I first had to find again in Berlin, an arduous task.Having a steady paycheck meant that I could of course keep saving money for my trips. During my yearly vacation, which I mostly took during the winter months, I’d spend 3–4 weeks traveling to South Africa, Vietnam, China, Florida, etc.Vietnam — A small hut like this was plenty for me. It’s only for sleeping anyway.South Africa — A really great country. Cape Town is one of my favorite cities worldwide.China — Oh man, what a rad trip …Florida! I’d brought along my inline skates from home just so I could skate through Key West.I lasted a whole 3.5 years at StepStone. The company was always moving forward — exactly my style! I also liked the field I was in. Uniting companies with job seekers. So far so good?Me winning 2nd place at a StepStone go-carting team event — as the only girl.My favorite colleague Simone and I at StepStone. We’re testing out the shirts for the tradeshow hostesses.After 3 years I slowly but surely started feeling the itch to once again spend some time traveling, longer and without feeling rushed. I also wanted to keep advancing myself professionally. But where would I go?After all, there are more aspects to life than just working or traveling. So where did I stand relationship-wise? Well, after having a relationship here and there I got to the point where I declared myself incapable of maintaining a relationship. How would I, — someone as restless as myself — ever be able to lead a traditional “Child-House-Job-Life”? I just didn’t think I could. Was there anybody out there willing to accept that?During my last year at StepStone I met We got along suspiciously well, but both agreed to not wanting to have a relationship. So, we just kind of did our thing… for six months. Only when our friends  colleagues started to doubt the whole no relationship thing, did we finally say — alright, if it makes you feel better, then I guess we’re together.Then, smash… Marcus gets a cool job offer in Berlin that he can’t turn down. Game over for us?I was doubtful, we hadn’t been together for very long. Would it really work out? I was struggling on the inside: Just the thought of leaving Düsseldorf, my apartment and friends as well as StepStone really hurt. These thoughts were joined by thoughts like “Well, after 3.5 years, it might be time to try something new anyway”.Then, a sign: I got a job offer in Berlin as well.I’m not lying here, only 3 weeks after Marcus left; I was also on my way to Berlin. A step that was pretty overwhelming at the time, but — in hindsight — it was the perfect move.Not a ship after all — but a new step in my career. Not a bad choice, I was still traveling a lot professionally and this time even internationally! Bingo. SEO- and Online Marketing, Conferences, Trade Shows  Events. The dmexco in Cologne, a rooftop event in New York or an online marketing conference in Seattle — I was there!Seachmetrics team building event in Berlin. I was always lucky when it came to my colleagues. I am a nice person, after all. Crap, am I the only one who’s not cooking but drinking champagne?My travel-crazed favorite colleague  friend, Natalie, who meanwhile works as an online marketing manager at the airline AirBerlin. No idea who gave us those silly glasses and hat.Thank God this company was anything but narrow-minded. Coming to work wearing flip flops or a hoodie? No problem!The thing here was that we were initially a very small marketing team, meaning that besides handling tons of events, I also took care of other marketing tasks.Oh yeah, in the meantime I logically spent my yearly vacation in Mongolia and Tanzania. Money? Not a problem! I mean, I was working.Mongolia — Steppe and Gobi desert. Something different for a change. Horseriding in Mongolia?Tanzania — my first big trip together with Marcus. We decided to take a Safari, successfully climbed the Kilimanjaro and hopped on a flight to Zanzibar afterwards. An intense trip.So, back to my job at Searchmetrics. Due to the multitude of tasks and the growth of the company we hired someone new and I was able to choose a field. In order to keep growing I gave up the event field and took over PR and the marketing campaigns via on- and offline channels and mailings.At the same time it meant I wasn’t able to be at as many events and spent more time in the office, obviously. Something was bothering me. But what? Only then did I finally get to the bottom of the real problem.It wasn’t that I didn’t feel like working and only wanted to lie at the beach, lazily basking in the sun all day. It wasn’t my job itself that bothered me but the general conditions. Every day the same office. The same people. The same hours. What I wanted was simply more autonomy. I was bored and felt myself being slowed down by the never changing working conditions. One day when we had a marketing meeting outside at a café, the ideas just poured right out of me. Coincidence? I think not.Any time the wish to travel popped up in me, my inner voice called out to me: You need some more freedom  autonomy in your life. This voice had been quiet for a long time but now started to grow louder and louder.Listening to my heart wasn’t easy. I had gotten so far in my career. I couldn’t just drop everything and start from zero, could I? No way. Could I really? It’s just not normal. I’m 30 years old now and have been at Searchmetrics for 2 years. More freedom? What the heck was I supposed to do?Luckily I’m very solution oriented and took a very practical approach to the problem — I just wrote down my ideas. Time to take some time off? I knew that traveling for a while might get me on the right track. So I asked for some unpaid leave — and got approved for 2 months.At the same time I tried following my heart. And since the only thing I could think of — you guessed it — was the cruise ship, I just sent out another application, just like that. This got the ball rolling.What I blended out, however, was another part of my „wheel of life“. My relationship with Marcus. Everything was going great between us, surely I couldn’t risk that, could I?I wanted everything. More freedom in my professional life, more traveling and of course, a relationship. One of my girlfriends from Berlin brought me back down to earth. Everything? Not possible. No matter what you decide on: There’ll be a price to pay. You have to get your priorities straight.I didn’t let up, mustered up all my courage and actually did end up signing a contract on the ship this time. At the same time I had no intention of making a decision and was trying to convince Marcus that he’d just have to wait for me for 6 months. After all, I did come to Berlin just for him.Summed up — I quit my job, signed a contract on the ship with just enough time to squeeze in a little “RR vacation” beforehand.Shortly after, it turned out that my courage had paid off. The whole thing also got something rolling within Marcus. The fact that he allowed himself to get into what came next, showed that I had the right guy with the right “mindset” by my side — always good for a surprise.For one, he got a little hooked on traveling himself after our trip to Tanzania. And secondly, he’d been itching for more autonomy himself for a while now. During our time in Berlin he had worked for several online companies like Daily Deal or Zanox and inspired by the startup scene in Berlin had always played around with the idea of self-employment and founding his own company.Marcus and I at an Online Marketing Event in CologneHe had his own business license and had worked on a few online marketing projects here and there on the side. I, for one, had never considered the option of self-employment.His idea was suddenly to quit his job, go into business for himself and just start out as a freelancer in online marketing.Learning #14:The story after that would honestly make for another super long blog article like this one. But let’s try to wrap it up for today.We took off to Southeast Asia and it didn’t take long for us to become completely engulfed by the idea of starting an online business together, meaning we would be able to live and work location-independently. We didn’t rest long but got started right away. And that was the beginning of our new life as Digital Nomads.Since then, we’ve been to Thailand, the Philippines, Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Italy, Spain, Brasil, Colombia, Curacao.Berlin does remain our home base. By now we’ve met tons of inspiring digital nomads from all around the world and have a 1000 ideas for new projects.Here you can see some pictures from a few of the countries we visited.Thailand — always a great place to visit. The best food in the world. Marcus working. The most beautiful islands?Philippines — My absolutely favorite country in Asia. Here you can see a cute Tazir monkey on Bohol islandIndonesia — Gili Islands  Bali are two popular hotspots for backpackers.Belize — Go Slow. Those who don’t know how to kick it back are definitely going to have a problem here. Caye Caulker Island.Mexico. Isla Holbox, Isla Mujeres. Iguanas or whale sharks, anyone?Guatemala. My favorite country in Middle America. A top spot for learning Spanish or admiring active volcanoes. Here you can see Marcus getting ready to jump in the saddle at a horse ranch.Honduras. Ever hear of Utila Island? It’s about time you did! Picture: A small turning maneuver on a quad.Italy. It took me more than 31 years to finally make it to Italy for the first time: Gargano, Liguria and Bologna. Fun helium filled balloons at a market.Feli and Marcus on the Carribean Island CuracaoAlright, I hope you have somewhat of an idea of my story now. Whoever thinks I’ve never worked and just spend all of my time lazily lying on the beach is wrong. All I’ve learned is the result of hard work. I’ve financed all of my trips myself and was always ready to more or less start fresh and redefine who I am.Something that I’ve never lost — thank god — is: My optimism and my zest for life. I never stopped believing in myself and in the good in people.My goal in life:Thank you for reading!You find more about me on Say hi on I am Blogger at my German Backpacking  Adventure Travel Blog #entrepreneurship #marketing #digitalnomad #founderdnx #travelblogger #kitesurfaddictedStories on life, work and travel as a digital nomad by 

Introversion and extroversion are pretty tricky things. It can be a sliding scale that leaves out shy extroverts and confident introverts in the minds of many. I’m not here to define your experience as a social (or not-so-social) traveller, but I can speak to the experiences of one shy and anxious introvert that’s dreamt of being an extrovert for, well, forever.Neither of those attributes mean that I dislike spending time with people, as introverts know, but that it takes a lot out of me to do so. My first long-term experience abroad came just after I graduated from university and decided to use my degree in biology to teach English in South Korea. Honestly, I can’t even remember the moment the decision came to me, it was something my boyfriend, A few things hit me when I lived in Korea: being an introvert is one thing, but being an introvert dealing with a language barrier is another type of existence. For a while, I retreated into my own head and was pretty miserable. Maybe it’s not the most inspiring experience, but I think it was one that was necessary for me. Eventually, I realized that I wouldn’t be here forever, and I needed to savour the experiences I had. I didn’t need to be like other travellers, but to find my own rewarding experiences.As someone who rarely expressed deep passion for fear of criticism and insecurity about opening up, I never received much encouragement to try something different–to stray from the traditional path of life. I suppose the lack of encouragement to do so meant I never really thought about it seriously, and thought I just wasn’t one of those people–even though I wanted desperately to be one of those spontaneous, adventurous, creative people.When I left Korea to go backpacking, I was terrified. Not of lack of safety and security, but by the thought that I am socially incompetent: I won’t meet people and create those lasting relationships that define many people’s highlight of travelling. Of course, this affected the way I interacted with people for a while. That is, until I realized that not everyone is that social butterfly, and that’s not how they expect you to be.To travel is to embrace curiosity about the world and people, and that’s something anyone can do. Over time, I realized that I’d never been happier in my life than when I was on the road and doing something different every day. It’s changed my whole perspective on what I want in my life, and it’s terrifying to think that it’s something I almost missed out on.(Not everyone follows the same path in life–travellers often exemplify this.)(You don’t have to party all night with people you just met. You can go out for a couple of drinks and then have an early night and an early morning if you want to.)(Sometimes it can seem like everyone is social and outgoing–this isn’t true. Travel will show you that everyone has their quiet moments.)(People don’t fit into boxes–OK, big boxes, I’ll give you that one. Having this type of independence really shows you the gravity of the control you have on your own life. Most of the time, it’s your mind that’s holding you back.)(Travel is filled with short-term friendships and relationships–whether a few days or just a few hours. Having such a defined period of time takes a lot of pressure off developing a lasting friendship. You’ll find yourself opening up more and bonding faster because of that lack of pressure.)So what if you’re not one to approach a stranger? The truth is that it can be much easier to meet people if you are travelling solo. Most people are more likely to approach an individual than a group of people. Just try to be comfortable and not worry about it. Hang out in a common room in your hostel, or some other area where people gather, and chill out. Someone will start up a conversation eventually.Most people have some degree of shyness or anxiety in social situations. The difference is that some people find it easier not to place so much importance on how other people perceive them. When I meet someone for the first time, I tend to look at it as if my whole reputation with them is at stake. The idea that you get one chance at a first impression can put a lot of pressure on you. The reality is that people forget if you say or doing something a little bit awkward, and it’s completely possible to change the image that someone else has of you. So, forget the high stakes, don’t worry about messing it up–we all do it.People love to talk about themselves and the things they care about. One of the best parts of travel is meeting people from all over the world who have experiences to share that differ so much from your own. I feel like I transform when someone mentions something that peaks my curiosity or catches my interest. Suddenly I could talk to them and ask questions forever. I just need to remind myself that everyone has something interesting to share, and things can take off from there.Would you really judge someone for being a bit more reserved or less social? Why would someone else? We’ve all heard it said that in these situations, most people are thinking about themselves. Why is this so hard to accept sometimes?I know it’s simple, but it makes a huge difference. It’s hard for me to spend time with people I don’t know when it’s in a group, but I’m not too bad one-on-one. I get lost in a big group–I’m not one to speak up or demand attention (not that I want it). But, I do like talking to people, learning about them, sharing stories. I’ve never had trouble connecting with people who completely understand this and are happy to hang out in a smaller group.There are plenty of introverts out there. It’s instantly comforting when you know someone else totally gets where you are coming from.I went on this pub crawl in New Zealand that began in the bar at my hostel. It was for Halloween. Throughout the night, the theme appeared to be zombies and vampires making out on a crowded dance floor, with guys in onesies crowded around the bar, and just crowds–you know, the sweaty, dark sort where personal space is nonexistent. I went along with it for a while, but at a certain point I was just spent. I left before the last couple of destinations, missing out on a free drink in each spot, in exchange for the comfort of street food and sneaking a flask into our hostel (I never understand the places that don’t allow alcohol in the rooms).The point is, no one judges you for leaving. And there’s no point in forcing yourself to stay somewhere if your mood is headed downhill. I ended up having a much more balanced and enjoyable night than I would have had I forced myself to stay in that atmosphere. It was fun for a time, but you can only take so much.Missing out happens when you are too busy stressing out about missing out than actual doing things you enjoy. So you might not be partying and boozing it up at a different club every night, but why worry about it if it’s not something you would enjoy anyway? My mindset is: give things a chance and if they don’t stick, don’t force it. The whole point of travel is to gain new experiences that are meaningful to you–it’s not the same for everyone.Travel Blogger. Explorer. Hiker. Sustainability advocate. Food enthusiast.

Je vais vous expliquer comment j’ai traversé l’Islande avec un ami durant le mois d’août 2013. Pour la plupart des gens et pour les agences de voyages, l’Islande c’est d’abord des volcans, des geysers, des glaciers, de grandes étendues d’herbe avec des moutons ou encore des traversées en bateau pour aller réveiller des baleines.Il est également possible de faire des excursions avec des gros 4x4 pour vivre une « grande aventure» : traverser des rivières, dormir dans des chalets et se baigner dans des sources d’eau chaudes. On peut aussi accélérer la fonte des glaciers en roulant dessus avec des énormes bus. Seulement, tout ça ne nous correspond pas du tout !Ce qui nous intéresse le plus, ce n’est pas forcément de voir de super paysages, mais surtout de relever un défi physique, se perdre au milieu de la nature en essayant d’échapper à tout le confort moderne. Concrètement, l’idée consiste à choisir un point de départ, une destination, ou une direction et de marcher le plus longtemps possible.On part avec le strict minimum, sans assistance avec comme seul abris nos tentes et les étoiles. On dépend donc uniquement de ce qu’on a emporté dans notre sac à dos. Idéalement, c’est le genre de voyage qu’on fait seul, mais après réflexion, on a trouvé ça un peu dangereux, alors on est parti à deux.Comme vous pouvez le voir sur les photos, l’Islande est parfaite pour faire ce genre de voyage puisqu’au milieu du pays, il n’y a strictement rien. Hormis deux ou trois refuges, il n’y a ni route, ni ville, ni personne. Finalement, quand on commence à marcher là-bas, on comprend qu’on ne va pouvoir eut compter que sur nous-même.On est parti de Akureyri, au Nord du pays pour suivre le 18 ème méridien, c’est à dire le trait bleu et descendre vers le Sud. Finalement, on a suivit le tracer en rouge, il représente 300 km parcouru en 15 jours. Je découvrirez à la fin des explications pourquoi on n’a pas pu continuer tout droit.Ça nous a pris environ 3 mois pour préparer tout ça sur notre temps libre. On a utilisé un tableur avec une formule mathématique pour calculer nos besoins énergétiques journalier et prévoir quelle quantité de nourriture on allait manger à chaque repas. Sachant qu’une fois la quantité de nourriture optimisée et avec tout le matériel on avait des sacs d’environ 30 kg.Une fois parti, après avoir grimpé une vallée complètement enneigée on a réussi à planter nos tentes sur une petite bande de terre perdue au milieu de la glace. Avec le coucher de soleil à l’horizon, c’était magnifique. Le lendemain un peu moins, puisque durant la nuit nos tentes et nos chaussures ont gelé.Une fois réchauffé, et après avoir marché pendant quelques temps, on s’est retrouvé au milieu d’un immense plateau. C’est ici que j’ai perçu deux sensations assez contradictoires. La première d’être totalement libre de faire tout ce que je voulais. Et la seconde, d’être effrayé de se sentir si insignifiant et si impuissant face à la nature.La météo qu’on a rencontré en Islande est assez simple : du vent, du vent et encore du vent. Du vent tellement fort que je marchais la plupart du temps courbé pour ne pas m’envoler. Avec un vent pareil, on avait beaucoup de mal à chauffer la moindre casserole d’eau. Donc bien souvent, on s’est contenté de manger les fruits secs ou les biscuits qu’on avait emporté en plus à la place des repas qu’on avait prévu.Cette source nous a sans doute sauvé notre voyage. Avant de partir on pensait que l’eau ne serait pas un problème car on croiserait régulièrement des rivières. Et après avoir passé une vingtaine d’heures sans boire, trouver cette source, perdue entre deux collines, indiquée sur aucune carte, était une vraie délivrance.Cette photo résume assez bien le paysage dans lequel on a évolué pendant deux semaines. C’est-à-dire des endroits composés de cailloux et de sable sans trace de vie : ni insecte, ni brindille d’herbe, aucun bruit. Pour ceux qui connaissent le Seigneur de Anneaux, on avait l’impression d’être Frodon et Sam au milieu du Mordor. Et à la longue, ce genre de paysage devient un peu déprimant.Au fond de cette vallée, on a trouvé un mur d’une cinquantaine de mètre de haut. On a alors compris qu’on rentrait dans une zone constituée de plein de vallées comme celle-là, impossible à traverser. C’est à cause de ce mur qu’on n’a pas pu poursuivre notre chemin sur le 18 ème méridien.Au début on manquait d’eau, à la fin, il en avait trop. Cette rivière était dangereuse à traverser puisqu’elle est large, une cinquantaine de mètres environ, et profonde, l’eau m’arrivait en haut des cuisses avec un courant assez fort. Imaginez-vous donc en caleçon, au milieu de la rivière, le sac sur le dos et les chaussures qui se balancent accrochées autour du coup. Heureusement, avec nos bâtons de marche, on pouvait se stabiliser assez facilement.Vu qu’on n’avait juste assez d’eau pour boire, on ne l’utilisait pas pour se laver. Après avoir marché dix jours sans se laver, les vêtements grattaient, on s’arrêtait régulièrement pour soulager nos démangeaisons. Avec cette petite rivière au soleil et à l’abri du vent, on a pu enfin se laver, seulement le lendemain, on a remis le même pantalon et t-shirt de la veille.À la fin du voyage, un peu par hasard, on a trouvé cette cascade. Elle est belle, même si elle n’a pas grand-chose d’extraordinaire, surtout comparée aux belles images qu’on peut voir de l’Islande. Mais voir cette cascade était une vraie récompense pour nous après avoir évolué pendant deux semaines au milieu du sable et des cailloux.Ce beignet est la première chose que j’ai mangé en retrouvant la civilisation. Objectivement il est infecte, trop gras et trop sucré. Seulement après avoir mangé principalement des fruits secs et des biscuits pendant deux semaines et perdu environ dix kg, j’ai trouvé ce beignet extraordinaire. Je l’ai dévoré, je m’en suis mis partout, en plein milieu d’une galerie commerciale.On est rentré en bonne santé, donc on peut dire qu’on a réussi le défi qu’on s’était lancé. Seulement, un de nos objectifs était de se passer du confort moderne et là je pense que c’est raté. Sans la tente ultra-légère, le drap de soie, la boussole et surtout le GPS, jamais on aurait pu revenir de ce voyage… Et pour notre prochain défi ? Y retourner pour traverser l’ile en poursuivant le 65ème parallèle !Traveler on Stage c’est le TED des voyageurs. 9 expériences exceptionnelles racontées par 9 voyageurs speakers pendant seulement 6 minutes de présentation .

I sold everything I owned, broke up with my girlfriend of 6 years, and quit my tech startup job. Typical 20-something thing to do these days.It’s really nothing special — I traveled non-stop for 4 years. I do it more slowly than most. I stay in the same place for weeks or months at a time rather than destination-hopping. There’s nothing wrong with doing it the other way, but to me it feels touristy and inauthentic. I like to soak in my surroundings and feel at home. Here’s how I did it:If you have a romantic partner with you, and you will eventually if this is your lifestyle, don’t expect to be able to stay in hostels or cheap places constantly. An arbitrary-ish average of alternating between all of the above options. Stagger between hostels, hotels, first and third world, and AirBnB. If you’re careful enough, you’ll be able to make your average around $30/night.The rest of the world has covered this topic better than I will here. For a lot of my travels, I’ve been unemployed. I saved up a frakton of money and just lived off of it for a long time. The rest of the time I was doing technology consulting. It’s a pain in the ass to do in the third world or in a place where you don’t have good internet.Oh yeah, I should mention that Yep, pretty much. But some people have better luck than I do with it. Particularly people who have long-term partners who work remotely as well. If your focus is your partner, then you’ll be able to maximize your time being in a different place because your focus is on being there with them. If you’re single, you’ll want to be social.You’ll probably get bored. And it takes way longer to save for that. If you’ve never done it before, just travel for a month and see what happens. A month is long enough to figure out if this lifestyle is really for you. You’ll also Speculative, often (ir)rational armchair philosophy and pragmatic life tips.

Earlier this year, I embarked on my first solo trip overseas, leaving home in Melbourne, Australia, to travel around Europe for five weeks.I struggled a bit with the concept being alone on the other side of the world, and as an anxiety sufferer I spend a fair bit of time worrying about what could potentially go wrong and how disastrous that would be. The trip was stressful and lonely at times, but ultimately an incredible experience that I wouldn’t take back for anything.So, from the words of a novice traveller/tourist/major scardey-cat, here are some things I learned about the world and about myself from travelling alone:(I wrote these notes in my phone when I was sitting having dinner by myself in Rome, about 3 weeks into my trip. I’d almost burst into tears trying to order from the waiter who knew no English, and was feeling very overwhelmed. By the time I’d finished writing my list (and consuming my pasta and 2 glasses of wine) I felt great and ready to take on the new city).(Photo: Dubrovnik, Croatia. Taken by Caitlin See)

I waited with baited breath on a warm summer day at the German embassy in Tbilisi, Georgia. Countless emails and phone calls later, I had passed over my stack of documents — confirmed flight and hotel bookings, bank statements for the past six months, income tax returns for the past three years and travel insurance — to the visa officer across the counter. The fate of my upcoming blogging trip to Germany and Switzerland, on invitation from the Council of Europe, rested in her hands. Four Schengen visas and four Euro trips later, I knew the drill by heart, but as an Indian passport holder applying for a Schengen visa outside of my home country, it meant one extra hurdle — obtaining special permission from the German consulate. Luckily for me, a visa was finally stamped on my passport.Tedious visa processes to enter most countries in the world is frustrating, but like with my fifth trip to Europe, doesn’t compare with the joy of losing myself on the charming European countryside. Truth is, if I had let visas curtail my freedom to travel, I would never have kayaked to the villages of Spreewald (Germany) which even in this modern age, are connected only by water; or experienced Sunday afternoons with pizzas fired up in traditional stone ovens, followed by a group siesta, in Umbria (Italy); or hitch-hiked with kind farmers through the rural countryside of Maramures (Romania).Four years ago, when I quit my cubicle-bound job for a life on the road, I knew the challenges of traveling with an Indian passport. I also knew that they are not an excuse for forfeiting a life of travel, for everyday on the road is an adventure and a lesson — and applying for visas, though it makes me long for a borderless world, has simply become a lesson in patience.According to the I remember being a nervous wreck one year ago, in the interview room of the United States embassy in India. I had heard numerous stories of how, more often than not, single women and freelancers were refused visas. I (proudly) fall into both categories, but perhaps I had filled up enough pages in my passport to prove that I didn’t intend to overstay my time in the country. I scored a ten-year, multiple-entry visa, which also opened my doors to several countries in Central and South America.In exchange for the long and trying visa process, I witnessed the magical fall colors of New York and California, lived with a Mayan family in a small countryside village in Guatemala, had a Robinson Crusoe adventure on the remote island of Guanaja in Honduras, got a rare glimpse into the secret lives of the Bribris — one of Costa Rica’s last surviving indigenous people, and found my own National Geographic set with playful dolphins and jumping sting rays in Panama! On the other side of the globe, I realized that despite the differences in our language, culture and appearance, our soul is the same — a realization that keeps me curious and traveling, fighting for my freedom to experience Visa-wise, things were no rosier from the other side of the lens — visitors traveling to India were subjected to tedious visa processes too — but in 2014, the Indian Ministry of Tourism started an e-visa facility for citizens of 43 countries, eliminating the need for in-person applications at the Indian embassy. I hope we will see reciprocity, for it is only when people can travel freely that we realize that despite the differences in our ethnicities, we are all citizens of the world — and isn’t that the single greatest lesson on the road?Shivya Nath is a 20-something travel blogger from India, who quit her corporate job and gave up her home to live a nomadic life.

I just spent the last few weeks of 2014 in Berlin and Amsterdam and wanted to jot down some thoughts. In no particular order.BerlinAmsterdamTransportationBut what about New York?Head of Product 

It doesn’t matter if it is a friend that tells them something or if they read it on the Internet, a humane traveler won’t believe in information or gossip without having hard proof. If there isn’t any proof, they take note of what is being said but, then, go out to find out the truth themselves.On the contrary to what your parents say, only a fraction of the events, people and things around you are of any kind of danger to your person. If you allow yourself to refrain from doing and steer clear of anything outside of your comfort zone, you’ll end up a very boring person. Even you will realize that. Passionate travelers aren’t naive — there are still things that would love to kill them. But they don’t let that fear prevent them from exploring and living.Think about it. If you have to wait for half an hour for your cake to bake, you’re totally fine with it. But when the plane is delayed and you have to spend another hour in the airport, it’s sixty minutes of trying not to curl up and die out of boredom. A passionate traveler will accept it as something that she can’t do anything about and use it to explore or create.We trust that people do things without having a hidden agenda. Selflessness is one of the most attractive traits in a potential friend. When you travel you encounter people that you’re able to help. It might just be showing the way to the best hostel or even being the last piece of the puzzle in a really cool business idea- the entire travel community is built on giving and receiving. That is how you find the coolest surf spots, the best restaurants and the weirdest experiences. When you give first, you will always get it back later.The first time I traveled by myself (I spent a few weeks in Albania), I spent every night feeling like the loneliest person on earth. During the days, I met new people and chatted with everyone. But every day, when I was back in whatever guesthouse I stayed at that day — I felt lonely. I just wasn’t used to traveling like that. But after a few more trips, I realized it wasn’t scary (or pathetic) at all.I’m not talking about materialistic things. The best way to learn is to consume as much inspirational material as humanly possible. Go to the weirdest events that you can find. Eat everything, even if it is from a street vendor. Don’t stock your iPad or laptop with TV-series — but bring books when you’re en route. I’m not saying I’ve succeeded yet, but I’m trying to refrain from killing time. That is a terrible way to spend any amount of minutes! Think about it — it basically means that you’re just waiting for something else, not using the time from now ’til then at all — it is just dead.It doesn’t matter in what way. Passionate travelers have too much knowledge and stories to keep it to themselves. They blog, photograph, write articles, teach or whatever it takes to get the experience out of their heads.What do you do when you are bored at home? My guess is that most of you (as well as me whenever I forget to think) pick up your phone to see if someone messaged you, uploaded a new picture or share another funny link. In the last decade we have slowly programmed ourselves to seek that kick of happiness from social media whenever we are bored or feel down. But the truth is, it is a fake feeling of happiness. It lasts for an extremely short period of time, then we are back in the same spot again. A passionate traveler learns to search for happiness where there are no screens.Instead, they know that in order to live out the stories that they will later tell their grandchildren, they need to close the computer and go out and explore.Jens Lennartsson: Travel photographer, minimalist.

INDONESIAN BORNEO — Borneo, the third largest island in the world, has captivated the hearts of explorers for centuries. The island is made up of three different countries — Malaysia, Indonesia, and the independent Sultanate of Brunei. I set out for Borneo as part of an around-the-world adventure. I had enough with being a regular tourist and decided it was time to take the road less traveled. For me, that meant journeying to developing countries and getting involved with different nonprofit organizations that offer volunteer projects to help humans, animals, and the environment.I joined a team of four volunteers in the small city of I signed up with The experience was so rewarding that I returned to Ketapang two years later to see how the orangutans were faring since our last visit. On the way, I stopped in the city of Our return to It was here that the team rescued A-Ul, a fully grown orangutan discovered on the fringe of a plantation. The giant male ape was in serious danger of being shot by local villagers, who were afraid of him being so close to their homes. The International Animal Rescue team worked quickly and efficiently to tranquilize A-Ul and bring him back to the center for a full health examination. Once he was determined healthy, the team released him deep into the forest, safely a full day’s drive and hike away from where he was rescued.Because of organizations like The Great Projects and the programs they facilitate to rescue endangered species, what is considered “a once in a lifetime” experience for a tourist is a regular occurrence for a rescued orphaned ape. And in my book, the orangutans are not the only ones being rescued. Working as a volunteer of The Great Orangutan Project finally led me down that road less-traveled I was searching for. I have the Bornean orangutans to thank for that.The population of Bornean orangutans has declined by half over the past 60 years. Over 50 percent of their habitat has been destroyed in the past two decades by deforestation, logging, and hunting. The northwestern subpopulation has been most dramatically affected, followed by the northeastern and central populations.Touching orangutans is forbidden for the ape’s protection. Compared to a human’s complex immune system, orangutans can succumb to even the mildest of human illnesses — even the common cold can prove fatal.Avoiding physical contact, especially with the babies, helps in the rehabilitation process. Infant orangutans form strong bonds with their mothers, staying by their sides for the first eight years of their lives. They suffer major emotional trauma when the adults are killed. Looking for a replacement, the infants instantly latch on to their human caretakers, both physically and emotionally. Volunteers stay at the project for a minimum of two to four weeks before flying home. Forming a bond with baby orangutans for shorter periods of time creates mental scars that cannot heal.Do your research and become familiar with the situation on the ground. Visit the local NGO’s website that you are working with (such as International Animal Rescue) to get an idea of their aims and what they are trying to achieve. Although The Great Project welcomes all volunteers, trade skills are invaluable. If you are good at carpentry, building, and especially welding, your talents are needed. Fundraising is also a major help — it costs over eight thousand dollars a month to feed all of the animals at the center. Hold events — balls, trivia nights, lectures or even bake sales. Every little bit helps.Check out The travel website reinvented: Get inspired. Plan your trip.

For some reason, I have always been a stickler for language and grammar, and in the past few years I have done some freelance editing for friends and acquaintances who have written novels. All of the above has somehow blended together to result in me travelling the world, taking on interior design clients from various cities, while simultaneously taking on the role of editor at Compass Cultura. It’s a strange mix of roles, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.I am the Editor — I scout for new writers and stories, proofread articles before publishing, and handle all the native conversion of our articles into e-book formats. Having said that, I don’t want to pretend that there hasn’t been the occasional difference of opinion, but we’ve always worked it out because in the end it’s obvious that we both want the best for Compass Cultura and are willing to overcome our own egos to see that decisions are made in the project’s best interest.Visit Interview credit: Nicole ChangConversations with people we find fascinating. 

When I look back at my four years of constant travel, my most memorable days are the ones I spent in the company of welcoming local hosts, experiencing a way of life very different from mine. Sustainable travel initiatives are cropping up all over the world, from rural Romania to the interiors of Guatemala, offering travellers a chance to immerse in a different culture, while also contributing economically towards the conservation of local traditions and ecologies.We looked in awe as our Sri Lankan hostess, Maulie, showed us old photos of And she not only achieved that harmony, but also decided to share it with travellers who want to taste life in a small Sri Lankan village — and hence sustain it financially. With a local architect, she set up the rustic With Maulie, we joined the village folk for an afternoon bath in the village tank, which is also the backbone of Sri Lanka’s irrigation system; we feasted on curries slow-cooked for hours over an open fire — traditional recipes on the brink of extinction; we lay for hours on our hammocks as butterflies and birds danced above our heads and the breeze lulled us to sleep. Sweet harmony indeed.By the shores of the stunning blue Lake Peten Itza, I swapped life stories with my 20-year-old Spanish teacher who didn’t speak a word of English — just like everyone else in the sleepy village of San Jose in northern Guatemala. Soon, we would say goodbye and I would walk up the hill, to my homestay with a Mayan Itza family; we would hand roll corn tortillas together and fill each other in on our day. I would meet their extended families and friends, learn about the once-worshipped Mayan gods (including Ixcacao, the goddess of chocolate!), see photos of their traditional fiestas, and consider myself very lucky for witnessing a fast disappearing culture and language.The Mayan Itza people, one of Guatemala’s 22 indigenous Mayan communities, settled on the shores of Peten Itza centuries ago, relying on the rainforest for food and natural medicine. Colonialism and dictatorship evaded the culture deeply, but the village elders came together to form Lush olive groves. Winding green valleys. Wild strawberry trees. Wild geese migration. Fields of pomegranate and fig. These are not images typically associated with the barren, stark, desertscapes of Jordan. But that’s exactly how the village of Orjan, in the Ajloun district of Jordan, welcomed us — thanks to a homestay project initiated in the region a few years ago.That’s how we met Maysoon, her husband Mohammad and their four children — friendships that blossomed over endless cups of mint tea, picking pomegranate and fig in their fields, hiking through the region’s olive groves, cooking lessons in Maysoon’s kitchen, and feasting family-style on the most delicious mezze I tasted in all of Jordan.I left convinced that when we choose to support sustainable travel initiatives, we are are doing ourselves the biggest favor — becauseTruth is, our travel choices determine not only how a place impacts us, but also how we impact a place. Choosing sustainable travel initiatives that involve the local community and take measures to protect the local ecology, heritage and culture ensure that at least part of our carbon footprint is offset, and that we leave a place no different, if not better, than we found it.

A story about my unplanned trip to JapanIf there is no one in a restaurant, it’s safe to assume that there are probably better places to eat. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule, but they are few and far between. 1 out of 1,000 empty restaurants may offer the best food in town. But right now, I am in one of the other 999. I’ve just lost a hand in a game of Traveler’s Poker.I shouldn’t be too surprised that I’ve ended up in an empty restaurant called Lover’s Time in Kyoto, Japan. I’m losing this game of Travelers Poker because I played such a great hand just 5 hours earlier.On this trip I have decided that I don’t want to plan things. I don’t have Lonely Planet’s guide to Kyoto in my pocket. I know of only a few attractions in a city with more World Heritage sites than any other place in the world. I’m here because I read a book two months earlier by a man I respect who said Kyoto was one of the most beautiful places on Earth. Spontaneous living, I guess. But spontaneity is inherently risky. Hence the name of this essay.After visiting one crowded tourist attraction in the morning with my friend, I’m reassured that I don’t want this trip to be an exercise in box checking. That is, I don’t want my itinerary to look like Trip Advisor’s Top 10 Attractions in Kyoto.I decide to take a train to a village just outside of the city in order to visit an Onsen: a traditional Japanese bathhouse. It’s cold and rainy and this sounds much better than being pushed and shoved by the hordes of tourists who, like me, have missed the Cherry Blossoms by a week.As I sit on the train, whose tracks wind and bend through the quaint Japanese suburbs, I watch as normal people live their normal lives. An old Japanese man sitting next to me reads his book, the only difference from an American counterpart is the vertical alignment of the text. We make a stop next to an elementary school. A dozen children get on the train and fill the car with energy and the ocassional annoying scream. They wear Jansport backpacks, Nike shoes and white collared shirts.The world is flat, I think to myself.After two train changes and 90 minutes of peacefully watching these people go about their day, the last train reaches it’s final stop. I arrive at Kurama, and along with two other locals, I get off and walk towards the town. I show the man behind the ticket window a flyer for Karuma Onsen Hot Spring and try to communicate with my body that I am lost. Being lost is my new normal on this trip so this is easy.I start walking up the one lane road into the mountains but I get sidetracked. I see a temple to my left and decide to take a detour. This particular detour lasts an hour and a half. I expect the ancient temple to be only a few buildings and maybe an acre in size. But every building has a pathway at the back leading further up the mountain, each one more beautiful and remote than the last. I reach what I think must be the top and walk around the deck exterior of a restored building that dates 770 AD. As I look over the fog blanketing the mountains, a door behind me opens. Like a scene out of a movie, a Buddhist monk welcomes me into the building.There’s something incredibly peaceful about being an alien limited to the phrases Hello and Thank you. I don’t realize it until that moment, but I have been meditating since my roommate and I parted ways earlier that day. I haven’t spoken to anyone in 6 hours. I am alone in my thoughts. And so I continue to meditate in that room overlooking the mountains with a monk as fascinated with me, as I am with him.I bow in respect and continue my journey.Minutes later I reach the top of the temple. I hold my umbrella awkwardly in between my neck and my shoulders as I try to take a photo of the scene. While I am able to snap a few shots, I accept that no camera in the world can capture this. In order to do so it would need to record the sound of that rain pattering on the rooftops. It would need to bottle the scent of incenses and cedar trees. And then it would need to somehow note all the emotions rushing through my blood.On my way down Mount Karuma I check my phone and realize how late it is. I hurry down the pathway that I ascended so slowly hoping that the Onsen is still open. I quickly snap pictures of the one lane road that leads to the hot springs.When I arrive I’m greeted by a middle aged Japanese woman who is trying to tell me something. I give her a puzzled look and say sorry with my words and my body. Then behind me I hear someone say, “What are you trying to do?” in perfect English. I turn around and see a white woman for the first time in hours.“Um. Uhhhh. I… I’m trying to understand what she’s saying.”“Take off your shoes, pay up at the counter and then put on these sandals and go to the changing room.”“Oh. Cool! Thank you.” I turn around and smile at the Japanese woman and follow the now obvious seeming instructions.It’s 9:30pm and I’m starving, jet-lagged and lost in Kyoto. The cobblestone streets and lantern-lined stone walls, in all their beauty are getting a bit redundant. I feel more like the characters in those In a city with hundreds of incredible restaurants, I’m bound to find something good. That’s what I thought when I left the hotel with no plan at least. But right now, I can’t even figure out which buildings are restaurants and which ones are homes. Every door is closed. I know there are incredible restaurants behind these walls, but I’m an outsider with no windows to look in.Finally, after fifteen minutes of walking in circles and not realizing it, I walk blindly into what seems like my best shot at a meal. I’m greeted by someone in the doorway, but can’t tell if there is anyone in the restaurant or even what it looks like. I follow her to my seat, sit down and realize my failure immediately. I look to my left. No one. I look to my right, no one.The server comes up to me and asks for my order. I think about abandoning the depressing atmosphere, but I’m too tired to musk up the courage. Even if I did, I’d probably end up walking in circles and awkwardly end up in the doorway of Lover’s Time once more.These are the realities of Travelers Poker. Sometimes a Japanese monk opens the wooden doors of an ancient temple. Other times, you end up with a plate of average tuna sashimi in a lonely restaurant. I’d have it no other way.Leave of absence from 

Back to 2012. We were fresh graduates. We were ready to start our professional lives, but craving for something new and different. Outside of the box, we said. That’s how it happened. Thomas  Brice, soon joined by Edgar, decided to create a non-profit organisation: Now, the three of us launched First reason, travelling the world gave us a positive mindset to start our own company.Both travelling and entrepreneurship keep you out of your comfort zone. You don’t get habits anywhere, anytime. And when you start feeling at home, you have to move forward to the next country or to the next idea. If you don’t, you are late regarding your schedule and your deadlines.Meanwhile, when exploring the world, you constantly adapt yourself to the country you visit. You get used to meeting and interacting with different kinds of people. You do not talk to a Brazilian person the same way you ask something to a Japanese one. In a startup, you will handle different kinds of conversation whether you speak to a lawyer, a customer or your developer. You are flexible. You feel comfortable in addressing different kinds of people.The trip will also give you a taste of freedom you will never be willing to loose. Of course, tasks and deadlines drove our project. Organizing meetings, editing videos and publishing content were part of the game. But it was our own choice, with both positive and negative aspects. We chose the way we managed it, giving the best out of us. We follow the exact same path creating Second reason. You will be glad you ran another project before you start your own company. You already know how to overcome many difficulties and the way you work is far more productive.When we created the The three of us also decided to keep on working together. It was a huge advantage to start again with the same founders: who is doing what and which tools we should use. We already knew all the processes to set up and the way we should interact. When you travel with someone, you discover both someone’s qualities and defaults. We had these cards in the hand when we started and took it as a huge competitive advantage.We decided to run a serious project while travelling the world and it might have been the best decision we took so far. Of course, it required some preparation before the journey and some work during the trip. On the other side, it gave us access to a large range of people in different countries.First, you get use to be in contact with people and feel more comfortable to ask for something: time, help and advice. And people usually agree to help a non-profit, young and entrepreneur-friendly project. This might be the first step in building a community around you and your ideas. And that’s what we did with Our community is also global. As W Project teams visited more than 30 countries today, we can rely on a huge and global network, but also target specific places if we need to.We were able to run a first project during two years. New people keep on running it every year. The community and the impact we have are far more meaningful. And people can see it. They feel more confident about our projects and even if they don’t believe in the idea, the team might be worth it after all. And you know how essential a team is in a startup project.Regarding Finally, being in contact with so many entrepreneurs gave us a really good panel of the different way we could start and run a company. People told us about both their mistakes and best practices. They shared their mindsets and beliefs with us. We felt the motivation and the inspiration while listening to all these amazing experiences. And we are more ready now than ever.Of course, travelling the world is not a requirement to set up a company. Let’s take it as a good way of opening minds, living thriving experiences and running your own projects. 

Australia and the US have a lot in common. As first world english speaking countries colonized by the United Kingdom, we share similarities in history and are close allies. So why is it that we have such different attitudes to international travel?60% of Australians have passports compared with 38% of Americans. Most travelers usually come across an Australian wherever they are in the world, which means that the roughly 18 million Aussies with passports are traveling Here goes:To me, it seems people are poorer for not traveling beyond their own continent and discovering the world. As someone who has traveled a lot and lived in 4 cities across 3 continents I feel travel has helped me to better understand the world and to learn more about myself as well. Travel can be confronting and challenging, but it brings me a richness in experience, friendships and knowledge that makes me a more well rounded human.Founding Partner of Funnel Ventures — making the world smaller for startups 

In the past five years I’ve ramped up my traveling big time. I’ve been between 60 and 90 days on the road every year, a journey that has taken me to Now, in a two-part series of posts I’ll explain how I manage to both to travel so much and thrive in my career at the same time.This time, I’ll focus on how you can travel more — specifically For much as I would like to, I don’t think this post can help everyone. I wrote it especially for people — both men and women — in their mid 20s to mid 30s without kids, who work for an international company and really have traveling as a top priority. It will help, but it’s not a deal-braker, that you’re from (or live in) a relatively rich country.This doesn’t mean that if you’re a 42 year old woman from Ecuador with two kids and working for a startup you can’t implement what I suggest here. Perhaps and hopefully you can. But bear in mind that the model and my experience will be mostly relevant to the people who are or could be in the group mentioned aboveIt appears that almost nobody has enough time and money at the same time. Only the retired and the “digital nomads” (more on them — the good and the bad — in the next post) do.The whole point of this post is to debunk this myth. Even if you have a “normal” job you can still have the time and money to at least travel 60 days a year, if not more.There’s really no secret to travel as much as I do. I’ve no crazy hacks, super systems, nor other fancy techniques. My solution is and has always been to think about time and money in a bit of a creative way.Specifically, it’s all an exercise of perspective and prioritization:- Let’s get into it.There are two ways to have more time to travel. First, you can ‘activate’ more days to travel. Second, you can increase the return on investment (ROI) on those days.We all have 24 hours in every day, 365 days a year. It’s the same for you, myself, Tim Cook, Barack Obama and the most hardcore traveler. The difference is how do we spend our time. This is obvious, but it’s a worth distinction nonetheless. You’ve the same 24 hours and 365 days as the most hardcore corporate CEOs and the most hardcore travelers.The key is to ‘activate’ as as much of this time for traveling as possible.The Travel-Possible Days are the days that you can travel. Obviously, the more Travel-Possible Days you’ve activated, the more you’ll be able to tour the world.- For most people the pre-set yearly holidays (anywhere from 3 to 6 weeks in Europe) are their only identified Travel-Possible DaysThing is, there are probably A LOT of Travel-Possible days you’re not aware you have.- The 3–6 weeks yearly holidaysIf you add up, these count as at least 20 + 10 + 100 = 130 Travel-Possible Days a year, even if you never work remotely. That’s a hell more than just 3–6 weeks.This is a bit unconventional, but again — perspective. It’s not your boss’ business what you do on a Sunday — if you’re in Korea or chilling at home shouldn’t matter to him, at all. You might probably ask “Who the hell goes to Korea for the weekend?” I did, actually, and it’s less crazy than it sounds.The main idea with “How to Maximize Time” is that you need to activate as many of those Travel-Possible days as possible. Activate as turning them from a “just one more Sunday” into part of a mini-holiday. A Sunday at home is not activated, while a Sunday in Korea is.There are five ways of activating Travel-Possible Days:You should always include weekends in your itineraries. Don’t travel out Mondays. If you’re flying off, do it on Saturday, or, better, on Friday night (as we’ll see soon). In the same way, don’t fly back on Friday or Saturday — fly to arrive late on Sunday or on Monday morning. This simple trick expands your holidays big time.Let’s say, for instance, that as the standard person, you take two weeks off in July when there are no calendar holidays, and you take them all in one long shot. If you take 10 days off, you would in the worst case have only 12 days holidays, while in the best case you could have up to 16.The difference is that in the second case you include three weekends off, while in the first you include just one. Four days on the road is a lot. And you got them for free.Per above, there’s power in activating weekends for traveling. To activate as many of these weekends, you can spread your holidays out.Instead of taking ten days off in a row, take two at a time. For example, take off Thursday and Friday (or Friday and Monday, or Monday and Tuesday) and see what happens for the same 10 days off from the above example:- Above best case scenario: Weekend-5 Days-Weekend-5 Days-Weekend. Total Travel-Possible Days: 16 days.So, by traveling more on weekends and spreading the holidays out you basically can DUPLICATE the number of travel days over the best case scenario of the longer holiday.I don’t expect you to ditch the longer holiday completely, or only travel the weekends. But this should give you a little bit of perspective. By being smart with dates, your 10 days off can yield 12 days or 30 days of traveling.To maximize this effect, use the calendar holidays as much as possible. Travel over Easter, travel when it’s Independence Day, Victory Day, or any other holiday. If you’ve a “long weekend” (when Friday or Monday is a holiday), you can add two holidays on top of it and you can activate five days as travel days at the cost of two days off only. This can be maximized over Easter or Christmas + New Years, when sometimes you can get up to eight travel days at the cost of only three days off.You don’t necessarily need to be at the office to work. If you’re not physically at the office, you’ve a potential Travel-Possible Day. Especially in advanced countries, it’s common for employees to have the chance to “work from home”. Take this opportunity wholeheartedly. But, instead of working from home, work from abroad. After all, if you’re not at the office, why would your boss care if you’re working from your house, or from Montenegro, Rome, or Dubai?I do this a lot. While my colleagues “work from home” once a week (or second week), I “work remotely” once a month or so. Often from a sunny, nice place as Greece or France. I normally won’t go Japan or Australia to work remotely, but for close-by places this is a fantastic way of activating more travel days. To make it work I would:- Work less hours than normal, ~6–7hrs maxSounds sneaky? It shouldn’t be so. If you’ve a good relationship your manager, ask him or her if you can try it out once. Then, over-deliver. If you get things done when you’re away, you’ll build trust and you’ll receive more opportunities to keep doing this.Going back to the big picture, just one day or working remotely — let’s say, a Monday — coupled with the Thursday and Friday of the week before off can give you five travel days at the cost of only two holidays. Do this four or five times a year and, again, you can activate many more travel days than you do now.There are jobs with a lot of traveling involved. If you’re a trader, a consultant or work at a head office you could expect to travel intensively. If you want to ramp up your milage, you might want to get one of those jobs.There’s an obvious upside: free flights, free hotel, free food. Also, if the opportunity allows, you can have holidays before and after the trip. This is especially good when you’re going to a farther away place, as what’s usually the biggest cost (flights) will be paid by the company.However, it’s not all roses. Traveling for work can also be a killer. More often than not, work trips will eat into your off-work time as holidays and weekends. You’ll normally work double as much you would do at the office as well.Don’t settle for a two week holiday. You can be bold and get more days off from your company. You can do this in the following ways:- Why would your managers let you take a day off every few weeks, let you work remotely and give you more holidays?Because you’re really, really good at what you do. You’re amazing and indispensable at the office, you’ve a great relationship with your manager and you keep your promises, always delivering on time and exceeding expectations. If you’re that good, you’ll get that extra credit. If you get that extra credit, you can use it to bargain for a bit more traveling. That’s what I’ve been doing.It’s hard to be so amazing. But hey, you can give it a try. When I’m at the office, I work my ass off big time. I work over hours, often on weekends and I’m the first to raise my hand and ask for more responsibility. I apply The 21 Laws of High Performance and live by them. You can do so as well.If you’re effective, you can manage a big team remotely — you might not be able to take three weeks off straight, but you can still do the shorter holidays. It’s all about communication. There are dozens of people I know that do this, including myself.But can’t you take short holidays, anyway? If not, get another job.… you work in an ultra-competitive environmentWhat’s your priority? If you work in i-banking you barely have time to sleep — or so my friends say. Thus, naturally, you won’t go world-touring big time. But it all comes down to your priorities. If you exit a job like this and land a job in corporate development or strategy, you can have a bit of both worlds, I guess.Once you’ve activated more days to travel, you need to make sure you get as much experience and value as possible out of them. Depending on how you travel, two full travel days to you might be less valuable than one full day for a hardcore traveler. You get more value out of your travel days in two ways: traveling smartly and traveling intensively.The biggest ‘time sink’ in traveling is transportation — including flights, train and bus rides, driving, commuting, etc. Thus, the best way to go increase your travel ROI is to either transport yourself less or transport yourself at better times.- Take faster trains when available and choose a 2hr flight over a 18hrs bus, if possible.This costs money, but it’s often not that much. It’s also money well invested.- Pros never check in luggage. Traveling with a cabin bag only will save you time, make your trip more flexible and also save you money. The benefits are worth it:- You can also increase your travel day ROI by traveling more intensively. If you’re serious about traveling, ramp it up — take it as a challenge, as a job. Wake up at 6.00 or 7.00, if not before, and hit the day with energy. Stay out until late, and only be at the hotel to shower and sleep. If you take traveling this way, you can do two-day itineraries often in one day, and this way see in one week what other people take two.While this tires me up, I always ask myself — do I travel to relax, or do I travel to see the world? 90% of the time I travel to see the world. If I’m Tunisia, I’m dying to see the ruins of Carthage, or the Ancient city of Dougga, and if I’ve only five days to see it all I take the tempo up. This doesn’t mean I rush through attractions — I don’t. Instead, I rush out of the hotel. I go all-in to see the places I flew in to see in the first place.I sometimes travel to Paris, Rome or Kyoto to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee or tea or to write the whole day. But it’s the exception, not the rule. If I’m in fucking Uzbekistan, I make sure that I make the most of it. God knows when I’ll have the chance of being there again! The ‘relaxed trip’ is not better or worse than the ‘intensive’ trip, but when it comes to increasing your travel ROI, being intense pays off.Travel more days and use those days better. That’s the main idea of this first part. Activate as many travel days as you can. Increase the ROI of these days by traveling smarter and more intensively. Do that and you’ve half of the puzzle solved.Time is one half of the puzzle. The other half is money. After all, if you don’t have money to travel, what’s the point of activating all those travel days?Thus, the purpose of this part of the essay is to give you perspective on how you could have more money to travel. This you can do by a) expanding your travel budget and b) increasing the ROI of your travel budget.I call the travel budget to a pre-set slice of your net income that you exclusively use for travel related expenses: flights, accommodation, excursions, gear, etc. The bigger this budget, the more money you’ll have to travel.For example, if your net income is 2.000 Euros a month (24.000 Euros a year) and you spend 5% of it traveling, your travel budget for the year is 1.200 Euros. You can make the budget bigger by having a higher income (3.000 Euros a month and 5% yields 1.800 Euros) or by spending a higher percentage traveling (2.000 Euros a month and 10% yields 2.400 Euros).There’s no better way to increase your travel budget than to make more money. “Don’t focus on saving pennies. To be a pro, work relentlessly to make more money”, or so people say. In order of effectiveness, these are the most popular five ways to increase your income:I moved from Argentina (low income) to Denmark (high income). I make something like 5X more in Denmark than I could make back home, and my disposable income (after taxes, rent, etc) is higher than almost all of my friends’ gross pay back home. Naturally I can travel more now than I did before.While I don’t think everyone can or wants to switch countries, moving to a high-income country tops the list of potential ways of increasing your income. Countries like Switzerland, Singapore, Norway, UAE, the US and Australia pay big sums for quality talent, much more than in, for instance, my native South America, Southern Europe, most of Africa and Asia.If you don’t know where to start, you can look into Numbeo or, if you would like to move to Europe, If you’re really good at what you do, get paid accordingly. Don’t settle for a 5% salary increase year-on-year. Be more ambitious.This is not an essay about negotiating your salary, but hey — if you get multiple job offers, you can play company vs. company and get a better deal. Make companies fight for you. Don’t cave in when your manager says there’s “no budget” to increase your salary. If you’re indispensable, put pressure on your company and negotiate a good contract.Your ‘day job’ doesn’t need to be your only source of income. You could build a side-business as well. For example, I ran a big dating advice network online for a few years and it single-handedly paid for all my travel expenses. These days, I write books and make presentations that give me extra cash.Don’t under appreciate the value of a side business. Even if you make only 100 Euros a month from your side business that sums up to 1.200 Euros by the end of the year. That’s a return ticket to basically anywhere in the globe.I’ve countless examples of people working within blue-chip companies that run successful side business. My girlfriend teaches a class in university. One of my old classmates invests in real estate. One friend runs his own investment fund and one other freelances as a designer after hours.The easiest and most popular way of making some extra income is to tap to the shared economy. Specifically, rent your flat on Airbnb when you’re away. If I’m off for more than two days I always put my apartment for rent. I get paid a decent amount per night, often much more than what I pay for a hotel in a developing country. If there’s anything like ‘effortless money’ in this world, that is renting your flat on Airbnb.You can assign 0%, 5%, 10%, or, if you’re intrepid like me, 20 to 30% of your net income for traveling. The bigger the slice, the more money you’ll have to travel. However, unlike the case above, now the extra money will come at the expense of something else. Just as with time, you’ll have a trade-off.If you travel as much as I do, you would be naive to expect to keep that millage and at the same time:a) live a fancy jet-set life — with a top apartment, the best car, etcYou just can’t do it all and you’ll need to prioritize. If you prioritize travel, something’s going to give. Perhaps you’ll still be able to save a big piece of money. But jet-setting, big savings, world touring, the newest gadgets and partying hard at the same time? For that, you’ll need to have quite some cash.If you’re not the very rich type, take these five big broad areas (traveling, jet-setting, partying, saving, buying stuff) and then prioritize them. If traveling is your number one or two, you could well spend 10% to 30%. It’s all cool as long as you consciously give up on a few of the others.It also helps if you budget — as per If you increase your travel budget, you’ll have more money to spend and more money to travel. But expanding the piggy-bank is not the only way to travel more. You can also have more money to travel by spending what you have better and smarter, thus increasing the ROI of your travel budget.Specifically, this means spending as little as possible in your travels without losing in quality of experience. There are multiple areas where you could increase ROI, but three stand out: flight tickets, accommodation and long excursions.I spend 35% to 40% of my travel budget on flights. Even in the low-fare times we live in, the tickets still sum up to a lot of money. While short haul routes are incredibly cheap, long-haul flights still cost a bunch. A flight back home to Argentina from Europe never costs me less than 800–1000 Euros. It’s big money. There are three ways to minimize how much you spend on flights:- Most top-ups on low-cost fares are useless. Don’t check in luggage. Don’t pay extra to select a seat. Bring your own food and drinks. By keeping it low cost you’ll save big time. If you need more than the bare minimum low cost airlines are a bad deal. If you need any of the above, fly with a “fancier” airline.Accommodation is, after flights, the biggest expense for the usual traveler. It’s usually expensive in developed countries and more accessible in the rest. Where to stay can range from hotels, to hostels, to camping sites, or to Airbnb or Couchsurfing. In all cases, I suggest you look for two critical things in any of your bookings:a) Make sure you’ll stay at a good location. This to save time, as mentioned above.The rest is up to you. But don’t kill yourself over free wifi or a continental breakfast. The only deal-brakers should be bad location and an unsafe environment. So, where can you actually stay?- If you’re on a budget, Couchsurfing, hostels and Airbnb have (usually) one critical point in common: they’ll have a kitchen where you can cook, usually. Cooking “home” saves you big money in the long run, especially if you’re traveling in Western Europe. Paying 15 Euros for a dish of pasta when you can cook it yourself for 2 Euros is a missed opportunity to improve your budget. This becomes less of a major issue in South East Asia, the Middle East and other places where eating out is good and cheap.- Then there’s good old hotels. Hotels get bad “press” from the digital nomad crowd, but in many cases are the best (or, in some cases, the only) deal available. If you’re planning to book for a hotel, look for discounts — apps such as Hotel Tonight can help (3-Day, 5-Day, 10-Day or longer excursions are expensive, but they’re also easy to negotiate. Even if the agency’s website says “1000 Euros, fixed — book online”, give the agency a call and discuss with the manager and tell her you can only pay 750 Euros. You’ll be surprised by how often they cave in or at least discount you a couple hundred Euros.If the agencies are proving tough, ask for a cost-breakdown sheet. Then you can negotiate on points that are over priced or even opt-out of activities you’re not interested. Usually, you can save by fighting back on transportation charges and opting out of lunch and dinner bundles (unless you’re staying at one of those all-inclusive places, where it’s a good deal).In all cases, NEGOTIATE! Don’t pay full price. Especially off-season you’ll get a discount with just by challenging a bit the first offer.I’ve been to 80+ countries using this exact framework. There’s really no hidden secrets — this is just a game of thinking about time and money in a creative and analytical way.Just remember — this is not for everyone. First, traveling needs to be high up in your priorities, as this entails sacrifices and opportunity costs. Second, it’s easier for young guys and girls in the richer world without many obligations at home.In an upcoming part two I’ll go deep into how your travels could benefit your career.If you liked this article, you’ll also like my book — You can also get a notification for when part two of this post is done (and a few free chapters of the book as well) if you go Strategist and business developer.

I spent a good amount of time reading and understanding how credit cards work when using them abroad. The most commonly mentioned topic was foreign transaction fees. However, I was more curious on the exchange rates that the cards operate on. Here’s what I found:You can save up to 1% by swapping between your credit cards day-to-day based on their exchange rates.The cards networks (e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover) pick the the rates that the cards operate on. The rates are defined per day and is usually derived from inter-bank rates. However, figuring out what the rates actually are is a painful process. Here are the conclusions I’ve made so far:On average I was getting a Your goal is to extract the 1% difference between the various card networks and their exchange rates. For this to work, you’ll first need to own more than 1 credit card and they need to be operating on different card networks. Now, in theory, all you’d need to do is compare the rates daily and pick the “cheapest” one. Unfortunately, it’s not (yet) 100% possible to get these rates at the same time. No worries though; we can approach this problem with another tactic until we find a permanent solution.If you follow the rates historically, you’ll notice a pattern. Let me setup an example to make the explanation a lot easier. Say we have 1 Visa and 1 MasterCard and we follow their rates for 5 days. According to our original dataset, the MasterCard card has a better rate on the first 2 days, followed by Visa leading the last 3 days.We’ll now make the assumption that in many (if not most) cases, once a network has taken the lead, it will likely stay in the lead for 2–3 days. We could now create some sort of algorithm that detects when a card network has taken the lead and continue to rank this network as the better choice until a change in rank is detected. At this point we would give the lead to the new choice. Now this approach will hurt us on the days where the change in rank occurs, as our algorithm won’t know until at least the day after. But this is ok! We’ll make up for it on all the other days we “estimated” correctly. In the specific example I’m using, we would still save 0.48% or $21.09.The app is called Mercez’s first tool is called iPhone and iPad users can This trick only works if the cards you’re comparing have the same foreign transaction fees (e.g. all 0 fees or all Web  Mobile Craftsman

Hey! I’m Tom Sennett, The first person I told about this plan was the guy I bought the van from. The second person I told was my boss, when I quit.Let’s cover some frequently asked questions.Yeah, I feel great! I mean, I’m a little hungover today, but it was my last night in NYC so what do you expect?But really. I have been frustrated with my life situation for a while. I had a very serious relationship end earlier this year, and that was tough… and when I got things back on track and stabilized, I started to realize that my life, while comfortable and by many measures successful, was not the life I wanted.I’d be lying if I told you I have my shit together right now. But I know I want to live a simpler life, I want to travel, I want to be outside more, take better care of myself, visit my friends and family, and control more of my time. Above all, I’ve always wanted to be a game designer. That’s about the only thing I’ve known my whole life, and this is one way to get there.I care deeply about what my friends and family think, and I value their opinions and take their guidance to heart. I didn’t want to be talked out of doing this. This is the first major transition in my life that was dictated entirely on my terms. Where I went and what I did always “made sense”, whether it was at Penn State, Scranton, or New York, and I found that wasn’t working for me. So I wanted to try something different.I’ll be joining a national 24 hour gym like Planet Fitness. I’ll also be staying with friends and family along the way. And, I dunno, I probably just won’t shower as much generally?I’m headed to my parents’ house in Pennsylvania to drop off some stuff and get organized, then making my way down to Atlanta to visit my brother. I will probably meander a bit getting down there. The only real plan at this point is to go south toward warm weather.Still figuring that out. I have one idea I’m excited about, but part of doing things differently now is making sure I’m working on the right stuff. I don’t want to put myself in a situation where I dump a ton of time and money into a game, it turns out great, and then nobody buys it (I’ve done that). I’ll be documenting how I want to approach this going forward.It’s not Play my games! If you want to support me right now the best way to do it is to To keep up with what I’m doing, the best thing is to See you on the road!I’m from Pennsylvania. I made RunMan and Deepak Fights Robots. I recently decided to quit my job and live in a van to travel and make games full time.

I consider myself an extrovert, as would most people who know me. If given a choice, I will almost always choose spending time with people over spending time alone. I usually move into houses with between 3 and 5 roommates, so social interaction only requires walking out of my bedroom. I became a teacher, so I could talk to people for a career, and being in front of a classroom is really the only thing about the job I like. I despise time spent alone writing reports at my desk, largely because there is no social component to that. I will sometimes double and triple book myself, because I hate the idea of refusing an opportunity to spend time with people. My love of people is probably the most defining characteristic of my personality.Only, there’s this one glaring exception. It’s a little confusing to my sense of self to admit, but I have this extremely introverted side that just wants to lock myself up and speak to no one for days at a time. I havent quite found a normal healthy way to balance these two sides of myself.I have, on two occasions so far, moved to a developing nation for months or years at a time.The first time I did this was also the first time in my adult life that I had seen this other side of myself. I moved to Africa, to a desert village in one of the least densely populated countries on Earth. I assumed making friends would be just as easy as it had been back home, and that in no time I would have a living room full of new best friends.But, it wasn’t that simple. My lack of knowledge of the culture made it difficult to understand how one even went about making friends, not to mention my less than stellar language skills.I avoided attempting to make friends with males at all. I don’t know what counts as flirting in my own culture, much less in a totally unfamiliar one. I did not want to have to navigate the social subtleties of nonverbally communicating that I am friendly, but in no way flirting, or at all interested in a romantic relationship. That eliminated half of my friend potentials right there.Work seemed like a logical place to start making friends, but my co-workers were teachers, and, to avoid corruption, all government employees were required to work outside their home villages. Which meant that at night and on weekends all of them left town. I had an office to myself at the school, so I didn’t really see them at work either. My house was on the compound of a pottery shop, between a church and a rock formation, so I didn’t have neighbors to hang out with. All of these things combined forced something that, up until that point in my life, my personality hadn’t really allowed for: alone time. Lots and lots of alone time.It might sound like this situation would be my worst nightmare. And, to be honest, for the first several months, it was. But, then something unexpected happened: I started to enjoy being alone.I had no obligations to other people. My time was all my own. I had time to listen to podcasts, to watch all the movies I wanted to see. I even started reading more, an activity which I had previously found far too solitary to waste my time with. For the first time in my life, I was on top of all my chores. Chores that had multiplied with my move — hand washing clothes and dishes, clearing cobwebs regularly, chasing lizards and other reptiles out of my house, cooking every single meal I ate, etc.Daydreaming has always been a problem for me. It frustrated my parents and teachers throughout my childhood. Even in adulthood it has been an impediment for me. In a fast-paced time oriented society, there is really no place for tuning out. But, there, all alone in my little pink house with the thatched roof, daydreaming was a strength, a way of entertaining myself, and now I had plenty of uninterrupted time to attend to it.As a result of having the space to daydream, I was more creative. Writing came easily in the absence of people to converse with (there was only so far I could take a one sided conversation with the lizard in my bathroom). I kept a journal. I composed long letters to old friends. I drew and painted. I rearranged furniture and found creative ways to decorate my concrete walls with maps, pictures and postcards. I knitted. I started experimenting with baking. I had one person dance parties on lonely Friday nights, turning up my laptop speakers as loud as they would go, and filling all the spaces of my empty house with my effervescent dancing.There was just something so refreshingly isolated about being single and living alone in a country where I was so obviously different from every other person. I had no one to impress. I could wear whatever I wanted. I could act as weird as I wanted. I was already a strange outsider, why not embrace it?About six months before I returned home, I started to get nervous that I had changed too much, that I wouldn’t fit in at home anymore. I had heard horror stories about reverse culture shock, that America would be difficult now that I had been away so long.But, when I got back, it wasn’t difficult. It was easy. Everything was easy. I blended in when I went out in public. Machines washed my laundry and did my dishes for me. If I didn’t want to cook, I didn’t have to. If I didn’t want to be alone, I didn’t have to. I knew how to make friends again.I couldn’t return to my old social self fast enough. I moved to Austin, the biggest city I have ever lived in. I joined clubs. I engaged in my community. I made lots of new friends. I got a job at a nonprofit teaching teenagers. I moved into a co-op with five other people. I could spend days at a time where I was only alone when I slept. I did this for almost three years, and I loved it.Then, strangely, and very abruptly in the middle of all this social bliss, I applied for another position in a developing nation in South America, quit my job, packed my things and said goodbye to my friends and family. It was so abrupt that it even surprised me. I know myself, and knew better than to give it too much thought. I might talk myself out of it. I didn’t know why, but I knew that I needed it. So, I moved without hardly any thought. I told myself and my friends ‘it was time for a change’, and ‘a good opportunity for me,’ and got on a plane.A few months before all this happened, I started to notice something in me. I’m not sure what to call it. Maybe it was that reverse culture shock setting in three years too late. Maybe it was itchy feet, or a restlessness deep inside.But, the real reason is much more absurd. I figured it out in the worst possible context for self-revelation: small talk with a stranger. In my first week in my new country, I was speaking to someone in my new organization. She asked why I had decided to move — a perfectly acceptable question for small talk, and unbeknownst to her, the one question I’d been avoiding thinking about for the past several months. Without considering my words, I blurted out the real truth, “America was so busy. I just needed some down time.” She made a puzzled face. “Can’t you have down time in the States?” I laughed awkwardly. For the next 20 minutes or so I said nothing, and contemplated what I had just learned about myself. I think I found two sides of myself: a social creature who loves the company of others, thrives in social situations and lives in America, and a creative introvert who is happy and productive in her alone time and lives in a developing nation. But, I only know how to acknowledge them in their specific contexts.Maybe I should have thought about my motivation a little before I left, but that’s not really my style. It occurred to me that I have never left the US without moving to a different continent (I also abruptly decided to study in Europe for a summer in college). None of these moves had any consideration behind them. It always goes something like this: Opportunity to move to another country presented. Opportunity accepted! No details needed. How soon can I leave?This time around I ended up in a busy capital city with lots of people around, and plenty of things to do, so I’m going to work on integrating social time and alone time while I’m here. These are a few ways I predict this could end: 1) It works! I come home totally well rounded, and have a happy rest of my life in the US. 2) It works, and I come to associate personal growth with abruptly moving out of the country. The cycle repeats itself. 3) It works, and I still leave the country to work abroad occasionally, because other countries are fun. 4) It doesn’t work. I come home, totally overexert myself socially, and find myself in a grass hut on some obscure Pacific Island in less than three years. 5) I come home with some exotic Amazonian parasite. Regardless of results, I swear off developing countries. Five years later, I find a loophole in my own plan, and move to Spain.Actually, upon further examination, maybe my raging case of wanderlust played a bigger role in this than I gave it credit for. I might have oversimplified the issue.I tell stories, write, take pictures, and teach. I am a day-dreamer and a traveler. I am usually suppressing the urge to dance.Here there is hope, humor, and help as you deepen your connection to others, yourself, and to your work.

Something strange happens when we travel.We experience sights, sounds, and smells that are unfamiliar.Splashes of color excite the psyche.We encounter all types of landscapes. Desert juxtaposed with lakes reminds us of how our lives are so diverse and often contradicting.Height brings reflection and reminds us how small we are.A slow river that crescendos into a cascading waterfall reminds us of how we feel when we return.

Shannon O’Donnell began her journey as a ‘digital nomad’ directly after graduating college. She moved away from her hometown, and quickly realized her ability to work online presented her with a unique opportunity: the ability to work remotely. Which meant, she could work anywhere in the world.We sat down with Shannon and asked about I have worked on the Internet for web-based businesses since my senior year of college. Once I graduated, I realized I could take my job anywhere and use that independence to pursue my acting dreams. I upended my life in Florida and drove to Los Angeles.

Do you remember those Tamagotchi toys that kids used to have in elementary school? They were handheld digital pets whose personal well being was directly correlated to the attention you gave them. The goal was to boost your pet’s health and morale by feeding it meals, giving it snacks or playing games with it. If you kept the Tamagotchi happy, fed, and full of love, then you were the best parent a digital pet could ever ask for.I’ve come to realize that traveling around South America with my wife is very much like raising a Tamagotchi. You need to have meticulous attention to detail. You need to be caring. You need to provide meals. The last five months have made my wife and I closer than ever before — but what’s it really like to spend all day, everyday, with your significant other? I want to tell that story. I want to tell you what it’s like to travel with a Tamagotchi.Early on in our travels we were adjusting to a lot of new life experiences and we were having more disagreements than usual. After careful analysis, we found the root cause: food (or lack thereof). I wasn’t “feeding the bear.”On our first day in a new city, we’d move into a new apartment, check out the area and find a cool spot to eat. The next morning we’d wait until we were starving to figure out our food situation. The problem was that finding a grocery store in a new country takes longer than you’d think. There are unfamiliar products, long lines and language barriers. By the time we came back to cook breakfast we’d be at each other’s throats.Something needed to change. We figured out that we always had to plan out our meals ahead of time. From there, life got better. In order to remind myself of the importance of this newly acquired knowledge, I’d repeat my own version of the Serenity Prayer kneeling before my bedside every night:“God, grant me the foresight to know when my wife will be hungry,You … gotta … feed … the … bear.Studies have shown that women speak up to 20,000 words per day and men speak roughly 7,000 words per day. This is neither good nor bad, but it’s reality. Early on in our travels, we both had to quickly learn what a lot of retired couples have to learn: I’d find myself getting frustrated by the barrage of random questions:It was like she was spinning a Wheel of Fortune wheel over and over, but rather than landing on a monetary value or a trip to My wife would get equally as frustrated that I wouldn’t reply to these seemingly harmless questions. She needed to ramp up her word count and I wasn’t helping. It was a game of mental tug of war. Sometimes, I’d respond to fulfill my “response duties,” but I had zero desire to answer the question(s). My word count was being pushed to the upper echelons of my capabilities.We’ve learned that we both need some “me time.” I’ll do my physical therapy on my knee, listen to music or read. She’ll chat on the phone with her mom, sister or friends. We both come back from our “me time” feeling much more refreshed.When traveling, the script doesn’t always play out exactly how you had planned it. I’ve learned that even when I completely blow it, Michelle will forgive me.There was that time in Mexico that I bought a connecting flight for 9:00When traveling, shit like this happens all of the time. It’s par for the course. However, you have to learn how to work through these mini-crises together as a team. You have to be forgiving.Tamagotchi’s are amazing co-pilots, but they need food and attention. Once we figured that out, we laugh and smile all day long. I’ve taught her that we should always carry an apple, banana or Power Bar for “emergencies.” She’s taught me how to ask more questions and how to ask the right questions. But for now, we’re off to dinner at a hip Brazilian steakhouse that’ll provide us with great food and the perfect setting to increase our word count.

Many of us love to travel and after consulting with numerous travel bloggers, we’ve pulled together some tips for safeguarding your travels.It’s easy to get carried away by bringing along too many clothes, electronics and valuables when traveling. Most experienced travelers can be away for months with just a carry on bag. In that bag, they normally carry enough clothes for a week, a small laptop for travel blogging and their toiletries. Think about it, you can wash clothes while traveling and you can use your smartphone for pictures. Another advantage to this is that you won’t have to check your bags or pay a luggage fee.When traveling, it’s a good idea to replace expensive wedding rings with a low cost ring — this deters theft.

For a lot of mortgage professionals, regular traveling is a lifestyle. A large issue of regular travelers is the best way to stay productive without accessibility to the resources that are standard. Occasionally, that first excursion leaves you feeling like a fish out of water. Particularly if you did not expect your customer’s needs. But with each new journey, you’ll learn more strategies to work economically. With a tiny bit of preparation, you are able to make your time away see-through to those you communicate with daily. Here are a couple of ideas to allow it to be occur:Change up your shirt/blouse with a fundamental pair of pants/skirt. Take travel size toiletries instead of full size ones to make more room in you bag. And for the women: leave some of your hair artillery, perfumes, and cosmetics at home. This items can take up a complete piece of baggage. You will look just as great with the simple essentials.When you organize your business trip you’ll feel discouragement and much less pressure. It lets you concentrate on the actual goal of your journey. You might get the chance to get the rest and relaxation you find hard to squeeze in at home. Thus, do not fret about your next excursion. Believe more about the way that it’s going to improve your business and rejuvenate body and your mind.This is my personal blog. I like to blog about things that matter to me. There are two such things; People and Traveling :)

While vacations can be a moment to relax and unwind, travel is a time to fully engage, explore and see everything as new, invigorating and possible.A friend recently raised an interesting point: that there is a profound difference between a vacation and travel.A vacation is a chance to relax and unwind, to go to a beach resort and clock out for a while, or perhaps to spend some quality time with your family. And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.But vacations should not be confused with travel. Travel is both exhilarating and exhausting. Travel is about throwing yourself far out of your comfort zone, digging out some unique experiences and immersing yourself wholly into the situations in which you find yourself. Traveling demands that delicate balance between copious amounts of prior research and that slightly maverick attitude of just seeing what happens when you get there. Because when you’re truly sidestepping the beaten track, there will always an element of unpredictability. And if you’re an itinerant wayfarer, it’s exactly that intriguing notion of the unknown which drives you forward.That’s what makes traveling all the more rewarding. It engages your mind, stretches your horizons and challenges your preconceived notions of what the world is like.Often the highlights of a trip, those tales with which you regale your friends and family upon your return, are those unexpected chance encounters with strangers who shared with you some unique insight on that country, introduced you to something that tourists on the well-beaten track never get to see, or invited you to lift the curtain back on a snapshot of their life. In the same way that it’s always that small, shoddy-looking, family-run restaurant you stumbled upon by a roadside which served up the best food you tasted the whole trip.Business guru Tony Schwartz phrases it well, “Let go of certainty. The opposite isn’t uncertainty. It’s openness, curiosity and a willingness to embrace paradox, rather than choose up sides. The ultimate challenge is to accept ourselves exactly as we are, but never stop trying to learn and grow.” This applies to traveling as much as it does to daily life. When we are in that mode of openness, then boundless opportunities are simply waiting to be seized.Curiosity is what drives you out of your front door in the first place, but it’s also that persistent itch that keeps you hunting around for new stimulus when you’re out in the world, surrounded by unfamiliar faces, sights, smells and sounds, and the desire to understand, to string different strands of information into a coherent picture of the place you’re in. And in the meantime, it subtly starts shaping your worldview and loads you up with a heavy dosage of compassion for your fellow human beings.One simple but powerful life lesson bestowed upon me from an early age was the value of being able to strike up a conversation with anyone. A shy child and awkward teenager, it’s only in my independent adult life that I have started to put this into action, but it’s taken me farther than I ever could have imagined.I learned this skill from my mother, who will habitually start asking questions the minute she lands in a new country; with the taxi drivers, with people on the same bus, the hotel clerk or the restaurant waiter. To be honest, she does this at home, too, with the local butcher and greengrocer, or any builder or plumber who comes to the door — she’ll always have an eager question, a smile and a laugh at the ready. When traveling, it doesn’t matter who they are, she will always approach people with a totally open mind and try to delve deeper into some aspect of their life: their family perhaps, or their religion, their country’s history, politics or economic system, maybe the impact of tourism on that area. Or she’d dig out their recommendations of places to go and things to eat, freewheeling us away from the usual tourist honey traps and landing us straight into the lives of the locals.She’d always manage to find out something completely unexpected within five minutes of meeting somebody. It helped us to build up a broader understanding of that particular place and its people. It also meant we’d get stuck in conversations with the occasional droning bore who liked the sound of their own voice far too much, but the payoff was worth it for those wonderful conversation with other like-minded, open and engaging people who were willing to share their stories.When I started traveling alone, venturing halfway across the planet to Asia, I took the same curious attitude with me and realized it wasn’t all that difficult. It just takes a certain measure of courage and receptiveness, the bravery of that first step to start engaging with somebody on a human level, regardless of your assumed station of privileged tourist. I realized that you learn so much more when you’re the one doing the listening. On a personal level, this adventure has seen me land a job in a start-up company halfway around the planet from my quaint English countryside hometown in a country whose culture I delight in exploring every single day.Contemplating the notion of living a life that is as human as possible (#AHAP) has led me to believe that we must allow ourselves to be driven by our curiosity and guided by our gratitude in equal measure. Courage must be balanced with deliberation, so each step towards fulfilling your grand project (whatever that may be) is bold without being reckless. Asia’s favourite maverick philosopher and one of the fathers of Daoism, Zhuangzi, writing 2400 years ago The most invigorating thing of all about traveling with curiosity as your sidekick is that you’ll never run out of things to see and learn, niche little pockets of subculture and history to dive into, beautiful architecture and art, the endlessly astounding permutations of the natural world. As Zhuangzi once said, “A frog in a well cannot conceive of the ocean.” The world is endlessly complex, and far bigger than you can imagine from the small, safe corner of the world you normally occupy.And upon your return, the new perspectives you take back with you enable you to see your own home in a new light. The phenomenon of reverse culture shock is no longer alien to me, and I have spent weeks walking around my own town in a state of wonder, feeling like a covert anthropologist as I watch familiar people going about their daily lives in a place that feels like home.Holstee exists to encourage mindful living.

Hello again. I’ve made it to Paris. The travel gods blessed me with on-time flights and friendly faces along the way. I clocked ~20 hours of travel time including a bus ride from CDG to Paris Opera, and a calm sea of subway commuters to carry me to my Montmartre Airbnb. Just a quick stop into the cafe for espresso, croissants, and a WiFi password kept me from my temporary home.I entered the 6th floor studio, and breathed a heavy sigh. The apartment is aged and a little worn, and remarkably tiny. The hardwood is swollen and imperfect; it’s an earthy walnut color with white paint splatters strewn about. One little twin bed, one desk, one chair, one bookcase, one guitar. How lovely. Most notably, there is one window. Through this window, I see a postcard view of Sacre Coeur, a lush tree-lined boulevard, and striking French architecture that would take your breath away. I also see the ethereal dream of a little girl, the hopeless desire of a broke college kid, and the focused goal of a determined young lady.About 10 years ago, I made a Bucket List. I saved it in a Word Doc (Youths — this is a Pre-Cloud Era writing medium) and quickly forgot about it. I recently rediscovered this list, and I’ll share it with you now, dear reader, if you promise not to laugh:Well, will you look at that. My inner compass kept me honest. 4/5 isn’t too shabby, especially for someone like me. I am not rich. I couldn’t afford to study abroad in Paris, no matter how much I wanted to. I’m not one for extravagant spending, and I try to live within my means as much as possible You just don’t get shaken up by petty grievances after having an experience like this as an anchor point. You are reminded that the reality you’ve constructed around yourself is paper-thin. It can rip and tear at any point. What’s most extraordinary, though, is that you can destroy it too.

The greatest secret of life, I think, is that you can exist without In short, getting diagnosed with an autoimmune condition at an early age helped me realize that we have no time to waste. I travel because I can walk. I travel because I am breathing and capable of doing this. I realize not everyone wants to, or is able to, travel this way. But through this blog, I hope to share with you a glimpse of the way I see the world — through a lens of unyielding (read: often annoying) gratitude for life’s simplicities and details.Anyway, this post has been all over the place, and I’m not sure I’m even getting my point across. In fact, I know I haven’t. This post was going to be about my goals for this trip, and instead I’ve word-vomited my life mission statement and past motivations. It’s a good practice, to remember the past, but I’m working on moving forward. Always move forward.For another time, then.I’ve always enjoyed my bread sans butter — not realizing it was the secret to a rich  flavorful life. Lifestyle/travel writer celebrating minimalism.

When you are young with dreams of going somewhere or doing something for the first time, grown-ups — be they mentors, parents, or mere passerby — have an immense power to encourage, embolden, and enable those dreams.Keith Bellows, Editor-in-Chief Emeritus of This weekend, after months of battling protracted illness, Keith passed away.I remember the first time I spoke with Keith by phone in 2012, when I was seeking partnerships to validate a far-fetched idea of using crowd-funded train journeys across the United States as a platform for building next generation leaders.The call only lasted 10 minutes.That’s how long it took for Keith to cut off my breathless pitch: “This is a great idea. We’re going to partner with you and help you get this idea off the ground. Let’s schedule a time for you to come in and meet with staff here at Keith followed through. He brought me in to present the idea of what would become the Millennial Trains Project to the magazine’s editorial staff in a small conference room at the National Geographic Society on 17th street in Washington, DC.At the time, I was 25 years old. I remember struggling to constrain my embarrassment as Keith introduced me to the discerning staff of the world’s most circulated travel magazine as a young “visionary” that he wanted everyone to get behind.That was Keith’s way. When he believed in a person, a place, or an idea, he didn’t mince words, pull punches, or waste time. He used his powerful, gravely voice, sharp wit, and immense stature to get others to fall in line.In this way, he championed little things into big things.I later learned that Keith brought people into the Geographic with such frequency that a shorthand acronym was used by staff to refer to the motley, ever-expanding band of pioneering upstarts he ushered into the Yellow Border: FOK (“Friends of Keith”).He was a friend to many people and places, and the intensity of his charisma made each one feel utterly unique and encouraged.In no small part thanks to the publicity and reputation that Keith helped build for the Millennial Trains Project, we were able to launch our first cross-country journey in August 2013 — less than a year after that first, brusque, deeply encouraging 10-minute phone call.The journey was as much a monument to his mentorship and vision for how purposeful travel could change the world as it was to the initiative of the millennial entrepreneurs and broad coalition of partners that made it happen. It was a monument to all our aspirations.Traveling from San Francisco, CA to Washington, DC on a caravan of vintage rail cars, Keith joined us in Pittsburgh for the final leg of our trip and arranged for an elegant dinner for two-hundred guests at the National Geographic Society upon our arrival in DC.Because of poor coordination and communication on my part, Keith was made to wait alone for two hours outside the beautiful beaux-arts train station in Pittsburgh before I met him to welcome him on board our train.Picture that: The Editor-in-Chief of the world’s greatest travel magazine, arbiter of global taste and hospitality, waiting outside a train station for two hours in the heat of August.Needless to say, I was mortified.Keith knew it and didn’t say a word. To be sure, he had endured worse in his many year of traveling to far-flung locales, but more importantly: he wasn’t one to critique high-aspiring amateurs. He was one to champion them.In his Editor’s Letter to That night at the station, Keith spoke to our community of millennial artists, changemakers, and entrepreneurs in the glass atrium of our crowded dome car. He urged us to see the world “not as it is, but as it could be.”“Travel is about who we are,” he said, “it can teach us, it can surprise us, it can move us, but most important: what it does is transform us.”We were spellbound by his ability to contextualize our journey as being exemplary of the sort of purposeful travel that he thought the world need more of: travel that taught lessons, positively engaged local communities, and turned wet-behind-the-ears dreamers in culturally-aware global citizens.Keith was healthy at the time. The sage, inspiring wisdom of his remarks, his shoulder-length white hair, a freshly pressed blue Oxford shirt, and a tan that evidenced recent travels to some enviable destination: he looked like a movie star, spoke like a philosopher, and exuded a rugged allure that captivated the entire train.He understood, appreciated, and could communicate the wonders, angst, and rewards of youth and travel better than anyone I have ever met.Keith was titanic to the end — both the ship and its captain, a vessel for the dreams and imaginations of upstarts in the great world of travel.Now that he is sunk, Friends of Keith the world over float frigid and crying in an arctic night, clinging to the debris of beautiful magazines and memories he leaves behind, shakily longing for smaller boats and lesser captains to hoist us from the cold.While on board the inaugural journey of the Millennial Trains Project, Keith sat for an interview with one of our participants, a then 19 year-old college student named Ann Yang who had come on board to explore how it might be possible to follow an unconventional career path, which she has since done by launching a pioneering social enterprise.Ann recorded Keith’s advice on the meaning of travel and creative living that she and I edited into a video that now serves as a testament to Keith’s powerful vision, love of the world, and commitment to enabling life-changing experiences for amateur and expert travelers and dreamers the world over.I invite you to watch this video in remembrance of Keith, and do whatever you can to support the fledgling amateurs in your midst as a tribute to his inspiring life.Founder + CEO, Millennial Trains Project // Editor-at-Large, National Geographic Traveler // Fulbright + Georgetown Alum

I was in Bali for my honeymoon last year. Me and my wife spent the first couple of days lazying around in Seminyak, where our hotel was, during the day and heading to nearby Kuta for crazy parties in the night. After doing that for the first couple of days, the plan was to go scubadiving but I had caught a cold which would have made diving difficult.So we decided to look up TripAdvisor and figure out what else could we do in the couple of days we had. Ubud came highly recommended with its art galleries and Fire Dance. The Fire Dance especially, the reviews said, will leave you spellbound. Even though Ubud was pretty far away from where we were staying, we decided to head there.And at the end of the day, after all the traveling, we were very disappointed. It turns out that all the reviews we had read were from Westerners for whom the Asian culture is very different and exotic. Bali is a Hindu island and both the paintings and the Fire Dance (I thought someone dancing with fire was supposed to leave me spellbound) bring out its history, something I have growth up with in India. I could have used that time so much better, just lazying around in Seminyak.Similar stories happened when we went to Nepal to bring in the new year. A pub called Sam’s Pub came in highly recommended in Kathmandu’s Thamel area, and the food everywhere in Nepal was praised as fresh and organic. Neither of them turned out to be the way people described it for me. I as an Indian, love my snacks with my drinks, and finally I have dinner to end the night. Europeans, on the other hand, finish their dinner and then come in to drink. Sam’s Pub came recommended from Europeans. And the highly praised organic food in Nepal turned out to be dal bhat (rice, pulses and veggies) — again something I can have anytime I want in India, and arguably better than the dal bhat there.We had planned both these trips the usual way — google the heck out of the place to get an overview, find places to stay and things to do on TripAdvisor and quickly scan through some travel diaries of people. So when me and my wife were talking about how to plan our trips better for the future — where to go, where to stay, which mountain do we climb, what beach do we chill by, where do we eat, drink, party — we realized that most of the experiences that have turned out to be bad are the ones where we just read reviews and suggestions from people at large and headed there. We thought we There are so many other questions that need to be answered to understand whether you and the person whose suggestions you are going to take have similar tastes.Why don’t you just ask your friends and relatives before you head somewhere, I hear your ask? I do and I would love to do more, except there are two problems with that too. First, unless you know the person and their tastes really well, asking them is as good as reading a generic review on TripAdvisor. A friend I thought would make for good company made me spend half my trip in Gokarna looking for a hotel in town with an air conditioner and a pot without a single bacteria on it. With another friend, I had to eat at Burger King 5 times during a 5-day trip to Thailand. Second, when you decide to head somewhere, it’s not exactly easy to find someone who’s been there unless the person is someone you talk to on a regular basis and you happen to mention it. Or you have a part of your brain dedicated to remembering people’s travel stories, every detail of it. Most people’s aren’t.I have a rough idea of how this could be solved, and travel planning made better on the whole, but first I wanted to put this out and get your thoughts. Do you face a similar problem or is it just me? How do you go around it? Think you need a better way to plan your travel?Oh, and I would love a things not to do list.Growth at 

For the past three years I’ve lived a lifestyle often described as, “Digital Nomad,” traveling through multiple countries in a year, staying nowhere more than 3 months, and performing the majority of my work online. There are multiple articles to be found featuring images of laptops and beers on the beach, promising that one can get rich quick while living their dreams. There are certainly some people who do attain this hyped-up fantasy, but like anything, the lifestyles of perpetual travelers depend on the people who are living them, and mine has been something different from the stereotype.That’s not to say that I don’t, from time to time, relish Instagraming a picture of my toes poking out of a beachside hammock, aiming for maximum jealousy-inducement from my 9–5ers back home. But in the real world, that’s the exception rather than the rule, because no one likes sand in their laptop, where do you expect to find a power outlet between the palm trees, and don’t even bother trying to find wifi on an island. Besides, as Florian, my pragmatic German I had to ask myself what it is that I get out of my travel lifestyle after Florian was interviewed in an Unfortunately, as is usually the case whenever I get mad at Florian for saying something direct and unflattering — essentially expressing his Germanness, like the time I complained that learning his language was hard and I didn’t want to do it because I was so bad at it, and his form of encouragement was, “You suck at most things you do; do it anyway” — is that he was right. After my first year of romanticized vagabonding, I now regard most of the world as, “same same, but different,” and am not infinitely interested in the various expressions of the same human condition. I’m such a “I [bought a ticket, sat in a moving chair, and] was delivered from [Location A],” would be more accurate than, “Yeah bro, I was just traveling through Cambodia, it was wicked, hanging out with the people. So much culture. Then I traveled to Myanmar, then I traveled through Thailand …”I’m such a travel grouch, I think that Songkran, Thailand’s water-fight festival, is — and I can say this with some authority — the most annoying holiday in the world. Even though Thailand is generally Flo’s and my favorite place in the whole world, from now on we try to be anywhere but Bangkok around Songkran time.So, accepting that I am indeed The Grinch Who Still Travels, what is it that I get out of the Digital Nomad lifestyle?Perpetual travel has allowed me to whittle my life down to the baseline of what I want in order to be optimally happy, and let go of everything else.When I first left the United States five years ago, I thought I’d be back in 3 months. I boxed up all of my possessions, put them in my friend’s garage, and told everyone I’d see them soon. But even sooner, I found that I much preferred my new life. I was only making $300 a month, but my expenses were even lower than that, and I was happy. So the following year, I accepted another position in another country, this time with 30% raise at a whopping $400 a month. I was still happy, and making so much more money than I spent that I was able to stop working and spend that savings on 3 months biking through Bolivia. This was the first big trip Flo and I ever took together, and the official beginning of my nomadic lifestyle.Soon after, I started organizing my years around working briefly in the United States and slowly spending my time and money abroad. I entered a distance education program at a college near my hometown to earn legitimate teaching credentials. Additionally, in my spare time, my first year I researched and I wouldn’t have had time for any of this if I had stayed home, and had continued to struggle for my spot in the rat race.That’s not to say that every moment has been some kind of In January of 2015 I was in the Singapore Changi airport — my favorite, and winner of the Fuck. Why? Fuck.After over an hour on the phone with the airline I found out that the reason for the cancellation was that the Manila airport was going to be shut down for most of the day, as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of Pope Francis, who would be arriving in Manila that day as a part of his Mercy and Compassion tour.I did eventually get us on another flight, one of the last to be received at the airport, serendipitously gifting Flo and me with what was easily the most unique sightseeing event Manila has featured in decades. The main roads were closed, allowing children to scatter and jump on old mattresses in the street, people sold all kinds of pope paraphernalia (Flo and I each got a pope t-shirt), giant TV screens were erected on street corners to televise his arrival, and the streets for miles from the airport were lined with Filipino women holding signs professing their love, like inexplicably wrinkled tweens converging at a boy-band concert. It was a great day to wander around Manila.Unfortunately, it was not a great day to find accommodations in Manila. After what felt like hours, Flo and I finally found a local place with vacancy, significantly more expensive and also drastically more decrepit than our usual dingy fare, but what are you gonna do on Pope Day? We took the room.Later on that night, after missing our chance to wave at The Pope by a mere one block and 5 minutes, we came home to find that, paradoxically, what looked only somewhat disappointing in the daylight was downright repulsive in the darkness. The hallway leading to the shared bathroom, dim and shadowed in the day, was pitch black at night, lacking any form of lighting. The worst part about peering down the dark hallway to the bathroom was: I needed to use it. Begrudgingly, I returned to our room, grabbed my flashlight, and crept down the hall.When I found the bathroom, I paused in the doorway to contemplate the shit-covered toilet seat, and how that affected my immediate plans — just long enough for a furry little monster to scamper out from inside the bowl to investigate the commotion I was causing. In all fairness, it’s probably a little bit of an exaggeration to say that a giant rat crawled out of the shit-covered toilet and chased me down the hallway. After all, I don’t know for sure that he was pursuing me, I don’t know his intentions. For the record, the indisputable facts are as follows:Most of the time I feel like my minimalist, nomadic lifestyle is the right choice for me, but that event represented rock-bottom, where I found myself in a position that no reasonable person would choose to be in, and no material or lifestyle sacrifices justified it. Owning no baubles and only a few articles of clothing, in exchange for seldom having to sell my time, is a fair trade for me. But if my lifestyle only allowed me to afford living conditions like this — that’s not freedom, just a different type of bondage. It represents the opposite end of the spectrum from which I believe most privileged people (a class to which I belong) find themselves, working whatever job they can find, and buying as much as they can afford, with little cognizance of what they actually want or need in their lives in order to optimize their happiness.I can’t say that my experience is any kind of prerequisite to a truly self-actualized life, but I’m happy to have continued to travel since, unafraid and secure in the knowledge that, at the end of the day, my needs are only somewhat loftier than a safe place to sleep and a rat-free toilet. It makes it hard to fear defeat by life’s other surprises.At the point of this writing, I’m in the United States, for the longest period of time (4 months, so far) in five years, working among wonderful people I’d be lucky to call my colleagues — you know, if I were into that kind of thing. I’m not completely without appreciation for the air conditioning and vermin-free sit-toilets, but I don’t like the way staying in the same place makes me feel like trivialities matter, or that I need to accumulate possessions to try to fill the emptiness inside — I’m talking about my barren apartment, but sure, you can get metaphorical about it, if you like hippie bullshit.I’d rather travel.I travel a lot. Sometimes I write about it.

Travel is a blessing — connecting to different places, cultures, and people has no equivalent and it is hard to explain to anyone who doesn’t have the travel bug.Today, we take travel for granted. Yet, just a few centuries ago it used to take ages to go from one place to another or to explore lands not seen and conquered before. Today’s technology allows us to connect, plan, purchase, and experience travel at an unprecedented speed.However, the magic that happens behind the beautiful interfaces is mind-blowing and hard to fathom — it is one of the most complex technology problems you can imagine. Let me explain.Let’s start with something simple — purchasing a book. You go to Amazon, type in your choice of reading material (these days I am reading The inventory system is binary (available or out of stock), while the pricing one is straightforward — it doesn’t matter whether you buy the book on Monday morning or Tuesday night, you have it with a Saturday delivery (maybe a bit more expensive, but fixed price) or via Prime by noon the next day. In just a few simple clicks you can get your desired title shipped to you or put in a queue.The seller could be one or a few, but the product is the same. So is the quality.Now let’s take a look at travel.Imagine you want to fly from your closest airport (say Sofia) to TechCrunch (San Francisco). While there are four (maybe a bit more) inputs, in essence you play with Origin (SOF), Destination (SFO), Date Out / Date In, Class of service (Economy, Business, First) and number of passengers. Now the fun starts after you hit search.To deliver a set of results, there’s no real inventory system you can call via an API. In fact, you need to call multiple ones and in a way, multiply exponentially the complexity. See below:SOF — FRA — SFO connecting Lufthansa (LH) with United (UA), with Return SFO — JFK — FRA — SOF on JetBlue (B6) connecting to United (UA) and then Lufthansa (LH). That’s one possible combination. But you can connect in almost any airport (Milan (MXP), London (LHR), Copenhagen (CPH), etc). On almost any airline or even create your own (Low Cost + Scheduled Carrier — or easyJet to London and BA to SFO).Now add to this more than 1,000 agencies and carriers that sell these tickets and you are starting to get to the core of the problem.That’s without even going into the product (seat, food, in-flight entertainment)…Returning that in less than a few seconds is a small miracle of smart algorithmic architecture, API optimization, logical caching that ensures availability. Oh yeah, and also you need to ensure that millions of people can do that at scale, at any point in time, without jeopardazing the systems that support these APIs or push partners to incur hefty costs (yes, that search is actually costly).Now that was a simple Origin/Destination search on two specific dates. Imagine if you need to show a price to any destination for any given length of stay in any month of the year. This is the kind of stuff that keeps us busy in what we do on daily basis and we love it.If we manage to get the flight buying to a state that it is as simple as buying a book, then we have not only solved a massive tech challenge. We have also allowed millions of people to find their destination at a price point that gives them the chance to experience the magic of travel.To Be Continued… [product], [business development and operations].P.S.

You’ve just had the journey of a lifetime. It’s a bittersweet feeling that washes over you on the flight back. The trip is over, but you’ll finally reconnect with all your buddies, eat again at your favorite restaurants, take a crap on your own toilet, and sleep in your own bed. But a week later a funk suddenly drops over you. The welcome back get-togethers are over and the refreshed impression of home has dulled back to its normal tint. Regular life has resumed and, in light of your recent adventures, it’s hum drum bubblegum.Here are a few tips to buck up your spirits as you blast through the common phenomena of the Post Traveling Blues:When a memorable trip ends the momentum of the journey is guaranteed to be swinging back with some force. Without the right plan it could drop you right into a puddle of funk, but channel that energy the right way and it will take you Tarzan style to the next vine of adventure.Host, Writer, Producer of travel, adventure, and food shows.

Trillions of dollars are spent on tourism annually. This begs the question: Where does this massive amount of money go and how can we as travelers take control?According to the Think about the multi trillion dollar tourism industry. 4 to 8 trillion (depending on what exactly you are measuring) is an enormous number. How many zeros? 4,000,000,000 … not there yet … add three more zeros: 4,000,000,000,000. Wow that is a crap load of mula. Currently a large portion of this goes to big travel companies and canned tours.The sliding scale of travelers range from the wall street banker who wants nothing but luxury, the guy who travels for business, to the millennial who is looking for romanticism or adventure. The one thing all of these travelers have in common is they want an authentic experience. Truly authentic experiences come from locals.Sustainable travel is compassion for the places we visit. Also, compassion for our fellow man. A genuinely empathetic society will be able to perpetuate the resources we have to create a worldwide community.Imagine the possibilities if we, as travelers commit to responsible traveling. Imagine the lives that can be pushed in a positive direction if we are able to equip travelers with an easy way engage cultures. This will result in direct impact to local economies. One of the zero’s in the trillion dollars could end up in the pockets of locals rather than big corporate travel companies.Traveling has moved me to become an involved citizen of the world. This has led me to yearn to create something that sponsors connection across oceans and phone screens. This is why Seekr was created.Seekr connects travelers to locals who offer experiences that cannot be found in guidebooks. Young travelers the world over crave off the beaten path experiences. With Seekr these travelers now have an incentive to on-board locals they have a meaningful experience with.We connected a group of African ladies who are passionate about cooking and sharing their culture to a group of adventurous travelers here in Denver, Colorado. Seekr invested in the meal. Travelers came with the knowledge they were having a cultural meal in exchange for a donation.We tested the assumption that travelers would be inclined to give more money if the experience was labeled as a donation. The test yielded interesting results. Each traveler brought up the importance of expectations. Labeling the experience as a donation completely changed their thought process. Very interesting insights that will help us build a product that has impact baked-in.The meal was incredible. Jemimah and her talented chef’s provided savory dishes. Travelers tasted an African home-cooked meal and engaged with another culture.Travelers told us the experience yielded a new appreciation for other cultures, a rejuvenated perspective on their own values and excitement to seek out similar experiences in the future.The test validated Seekr’s hypothesis and mission: Enabling cultural and authentic experiences will give travelers a new appreciation and providers will gain a new sense of pride from sharing their culture and knowledge.This is one small example of how travel is local. Connecting to local people is the best way to truly experience a location. Watching money go directly into the pockets of locals is even better.Before the meal, Jemimah gave a great talk about how the world is one person. It doesn’t matter if we are from Kenya, Congo or The United States we all are one because we are all connected.I have traveled around the world twice. Discovering cultural enrichment thourghout my travels and in my own backyard tells me the world is flat. Technology has enabled forces to converge resulting in an even playing field around the world.

So, some people can be inarticulate, glib or pretentious about world travel. They make a pretty easy, lazy target. There are plenty of glib, lazy, pretentious people who don’t travel as well.Many more find travel rewarding, giving them perspective on their own lives.

First of all, I’m not trying to make you jealous, Bold statement alert! Haha sorry this is my naive way of thinking, but please bare with me because I can explain how toRiding a different route to work, brushing your teeth with your other arm, that’s not going to cut it, What I often did was A disparate combination of AirBnB and venture capital(ism) systematically dismantled the whole Couchsurfing movement. Some things just can’t by sustained forever. It was once a thriving ‘gift economy’, powered by a non-profit team, where hosts kept on giving travelers a great experience in their home town. AirBnB made hosting very lucrative, so many stopped hosting for free, and venture capital invested in CS that forced the once passionated altruistic people behind the community to push for more users (read: abusers). Basically I’m making the same hours as anywhere, but then in another place and if bit sized chunks spread of the day.You, my friends and colleagues often ask me why I go on a holiday or vacation all the time. To be totally clear, I’m not taking weeks off, I travel to another place and keep working every day because for me…“Yeah I think if you’re reading this there’s a high chance you being a knowledge worker, that means you sit at a desk all day with some people around you that interrupt you all the time. For exampleJust look at one my connections Liza Jansen doing this exactly: If you’re reading this and you still think you can’t work online from anywhere. “With for example Couchsurfing you can actually I stay with friends that I mostly met through Couchsurfing, hosting them in Amsterdam or while traveling. Also from the By If I had a house, and In 2014 I still had a home to host people from and get karma, now I’m using AirBnB and my social networks to travel, get around and stay in lovely places, which are not cheap but not at all expensive relative to what you’re paying in cities like London, Amsterdam and New York.Currently I am repeatedly To share these travel adventures with someone is one of my dreams come true. Together with my lovely companion Loes, she also learning to share the useful tool to travel haha, like I do with my blog:Not only is a travel companion so incredibly indescribably great. Other friends of mine doing the same in New Zealand, Mexico anywhere can acknowledge that;Being on the Virgin Island, it’s better to show the exciting stuff like sailing, driving, (hitch)hiking and what not. Since sitting behind my macbook is not exciting to film, I left that out and only put in the fun parts:making technology come alive 〰 initiating 

I was brought to my knees by the natural beauty of the Japanese landscape; from the rivers and valleys to the smattering of tiny islands along the Seto Inland sea. And in the two weeks alone, I immersed myself in the beauty of the language, the delicate flavours of the food, their tireless dedication to tradition, and all the cultural nuances in between.This is my fourth time in Japan and every time I go, I get more and more from this country. To me, Japan is intoxicating and strangely reminiscent of home for me.One of my core desired feelings (It can be both exhilarating as well as scary in that you come face to face with all the things that cannot be controlled. And in a way, perhaps that is the lesson we really need.Arriving at a place that I have never been before; it feels like a clean slate, a new beginning, a fresh notebook ready to be written in. It gave me the gentle nudge I needed to to connect back with myself and get comfortable with being in my own skin.As a result, I was more open to meeting people and embracing opportunities whenever they came up. And for some reason, I found that I connected so much deeper with people like this instead of when I am caught up in my own little day to day routine. As a result, I met some truly amazing people on my travels; people who are marching to the beat of their own drum, people who have a beautiful curiousity for the world, people who have stirred my soul in so many ways.The weeks leading up to my trip overseas, I was anxiously filling every moment of my day with a never-ending checklist of to dos. I was all swept up in a flurry of procrastination mixed with inspiration and struggled to find time to sit still for even a moment. It was a frustrating combo of emotions.I chose to spend my days strolling around towns with a slower pace and indulged in nature hikes. I felt time slow and it felt like there was space again. It was a like a breath of fresh air. I revelled in watching the cityscape blur on train rides and enjoyed long mornings sitting in cafes. In the end, it helped me declutter all the unnecessary things that was filling up my life and allowed me to refocus, and distill out that which I was seeking. And most importantly, it gave me the time to heal from things that I had been holding on to.In our day to day lives, it is so easy to get caught up in an automatic state of being. We forget to truly appreciate the moment. Travelling by myself has definitely helped me rediscover how precious each fleeting moment is.I believe that when we exist outside our comfort zone or experience something for the first time, our emotions and sensations are heightened. I remember being awestruck by the texture of tofu, mesmerised by the way the rain falls onto the cobbled streets of Kyoto alleyways and being overcome with emotion on my train ride as it pulled away from Hiroshima station. I learned to embrace every emotion to its core, to feel it and to release it.During my travels, I realised how much I came to trust my intuition and instinct. I was regularly checking in with myself on so many occasions to see how I was feeling. There is a sense of stillness when you are travelling on your own in that you spend a lot of time with your thoughts as your guide. I became very observant of my thoughts in that it felt almost meditative. And now that I am back in my hometown, I am reminded to enjoy the stillness of my observations.Travelling solo has definitely taught me how to enjoy my own company. And it remains one of the main reasons why I crave travelling on my own. In Melbourne, I became so accustomed to relying on the company of others that I sometimes struggled with the idea of spending my evenings or weekends alone. In Japan, I learned to love the experience of dining by myself, taking myself on hikes and experiencing the cities by myself. And oddly enough, I no longer felt compelled to share it with someone. In some ways, the experience was sacred in that it was mine.For more blog posts | I am a happy yogi, herbal tea enthusiast, early morning riser and creator of TheMindfulMorning.com | NarrowRoadWithin

I want to tell a short story about small but very proud country Georgia.We spend there three wonderful month and saw almost everything. But the hardest part was to find this amazing places. So I decided to create one TOP 10 list of Georgian Nature best of the best places to visit.1000 miles. 5 days. 4 people. 1 Toyota Prius. We made it!These caves are very close to Kutaisi. It’s a huge tunnels of dozen caves with wonderful lights inside. I would recommend you to take underground River trip option in your excursion plan. It’s short but worse it! When you will have such chance again? ;)This place is not very popular destination in Georgia. But for me it was the best one! Fairytale on Earth. You are expecting elfs and trolls to jump outside of every second bush! Water is falling from 9 meters with incredible noise! Breathtaking!I would recommend going there for few hours. Maybe even have picnic there. You should definitely rent the boat (it’s cheap) and go up the river to see the main Canyon, the old bridges, waterfall and maybe even swim in emerald water.It’s an ancient city basedJust best sights ever! Marvelous valleys, peaceful ships, small villages and nice people.Pictures are saying more than I can. 2.2 km altitude. Sometimes even hard to breath. But I would do that again! Try staing in Tsar Bani hotel — wonderful place.Kazbek is a potentially active volcano, built up of trachyte and sheathed with lava, and has the shape of a double cone. Just go “russian” road farther Gudauri and you will find it! Great mountain with snow peak.4 hours drive from Batumi. Nice and quiet places. You also can find storage reservoir worth visiting there.This photo cant represent the beauty of this place. Waterfall is high and has place to swim. So if you are near Batumi just spend 40 minutes and visit this place. You can also go to Adjaria Vine House on the same road.The most wet place in all Europe. You will find a few waterfalls and 50 shades of green there! Beatiful flowers and trees. If you like hiking — this is the place!This trip should better be made by car and during minimum 5–7 days. Have a nice journey friends!CEO, founder 

There are hundreds of articles of photographers switching from Canon to Nikon, or from DSLR to mirrorless or from mirrorless to a smartphone. This is not one of them. While I My last trip to Russia-Germany-Iceland I packed a combined 60 Kg of stuff — promo swag, things for the family, and also photo-equipment. In total, I was hauling around a 20kg photo bag, and another 7kg photo bag with a drone.Carrying around Nikon D810, a bunch of lenses, adaptors, battery packs, big RRS tripod, DJI Phantom drone is not something anyone can honestly enjoy, so when I got home, I reevaluated what I needed for my travel.As the result, I put together this lightweight set:There are a few similar mirrorless systems on the market, but I choose Fujifilm for two practical purposes — organically, a lot of our team has bought or switched to Fujifilm, so there’s a chance to share lenses or accessories, and as Fujifilm is a title sponsor of the global photowalk, I got myself a loaner for a month, which I plan to replace with my hard-earned set when the loaner is due for a return.Basically, I looked into what I usually shoot, and discovered that most of my landscape photos are wide-angle. Anything that I shoot in the city is around 35mm and most portraits are obviously in 70–135mm range, so 85mm is a sweet spot.Now, for my last two trips, 4 and 12 days, everything I have is in a carry-on, as opposed to multiple bags, where tripod alone was so massive, it only fit in a big check-in luggage.Travelling with such a kit makes me way more mobile. I feel less lazy carrying around a lighter, but still sturdy tripod with me, and I feel that having a camera that doesn’t hurt my back or neck is a Founder of Thoughts on photo business, photo-sharing and the future of photography.

It’s a simple, yet significant thought.In all our research about Travel  Tourism, we talk about the importance of the sector to global GDP and employment. Travel  Tourism is one of the largest employers in the world and contributes nearly 10% to the world’s GDP. But what about the people factor in all of this? Countless travellers speak of the marvels of far off places; of the eye-opening experiences they’ve had in culturally opposite countries; the mind-expanding benefits of leaving their comfort zones and speaking to new people; and the palette-challenging excitement of devouring new types of cuisines.Don’t we all deserve that right? Yet people born in certain countries enjoy more travel freedom than others. And while there are many political reasons for this, our idea is simple: our common desire for travel is a great equalizer. Of course, there are a few good reasons for visa processes (which you can read more about So, say it with us: WE ALL WANT THE RIGHT FOR TRAVEL FREEDOM.You can learn more about our strategic mission for the Freedom to Travel one our We’d love to hear your travel stories.

Food is such an important part of travelling. I promise I’m not saying that because I’m French. I also promise I’m not going to boast about French food. I hate it when French people do that when they’re abroad (actually they even do that when they’re at home, surrounded by French people — I guess good boasting requires training).I remember that time on Okstindan glacier in Norway. We left the car (a I could tell you about that tiny sobaya (noodle house) in the Asakusa district of Tokyo, more precisely on a street corner nextdoor to Nakamise-dori. I went to Japan in 2007, and randomly sat there to have dinner. What can I say? Seven years later, I go back to Japan with my wife, we land in Tokyo, we drop our bags in our hostel and head out right away in the evening sun to fight the jet lag. The first thing that came to my mind upon reaching Nakamise-dori again, was that sobaya. That, and also the anko (red bean paste) pastries that they bake all day long on Nakamise-dori and sell — still hot — in paper bags. The Ok, just one last and then I let you go and prepare dinner (or lunch) (or, come to think of it, breakfast: I learned from experience that breakfast is the one meal of the day that can be had anytime during the day, several times a day).Tetsa River. Did you hear of that place? Nope? I’m surprised. On the highway leading there, there are road signs that clearly say: “World Famous Cinnamon Buns”.So of course we stopped there and installed our tent.(My wife and I love these road signs. We don’t have them in France. Do you imagine a sign that’d say: “World Famous What can I say about Tetsa River Provincial Park? That it’s the best we ever had.

I blinked myself out of a hazy snooze and squinted at my vibrating phone. It was the call I had been waiting for, but secretly dreading. I had applied for the job of my dreams, but contrary to everything I had been working toward, I found myself praying that I wouldn’t get it.Counterintuitively, the job that I wanted was actually the job I was hoping not to get. I was about to make a major life decision, and I didn’t know what to do.Six months ago, in the scorching heat of summer, I arrived in New York City with nothing more than a backpack. I had just completed a six-month stint in Asheville, NC, where I spent the strangest time of my life So off I went.Within a week of touching down in NYC, I hit the streets with my CV, stopping in at all the best cocktail bars in the city. It took a solid month, but I landed a job at one of the city’s most notable speakeasies. I was beside myself. I found my way to New York and I landed on my feet.Five months later, I received an offer to bartend at a luxury hotel in Beijing. Though The offer was for six months, and the money was better than good. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that taking this offer would allow me to visit the places that I wanted. I could work for a pre-determined amount of time and then take off with a bulging wallet to anywhere else in the world. This was shaping up to be a pretty spectacular plan.Until one particular email caught my attention…It was a message from the manager at another one of New York City’s best cocktail bars. One of those places that release those bespoke coffee table books. One of those places that is an industry leader and that everybody knows by name. One of those places with “street cred” and invaluable industry perks.I responded with no hesitation, and two days later I was sitting down for an interview. Our dialogue quickly turned into an in-depth character analysis. They wanted to be sure that whomever they brought on board would be the type of person they could grow with. They were serious about finding the right talent with the right personality and the right attitude. They were looking for someone to be a part of their family.And they were looking for a 1–2 year commitment.A little bit of dribble had caked itself onto the corner of my mouth as my head hung backwards onto the headrest. I was dead asleep in the backseat of an undersized VW “Hi, this is Jeremy,” I mumbled, still not fully in control of my vocal chords. To be honest, all I wanted to do was ignore the call. I never wanted to know the answer because, as soon as I did, and as soon as I heard the words “good news” through the speakerphone, I realized that I was going to have to make the hardest decision of my lifeThe offer was, indeed, a good one. I would make mediocre money but I would be doing something I loved. I would be living in New York City and I would be learning and working with some of the best in the industry. I could have been a relative success story — the type you hear about where you show up homeless in New York and actually make something half-decent of yourself. I could envision the next two years of my life and I could see them taking me to some very exciting places in my career.On the other hand, Beijing was calling. I would be living in a luxury hotel, expenses covered, working at a brand new bar with an up-and-coming consulting group. It was a six-month contract and I would get to travel.And I would make enough money to be able to travel even more extensively after that.I was given three days to decide, but before I had even hung up the phone, I already knew my answer. Despite that, I banged my head against the wall for the next 72 hours. I wrote pros and cons lists. I talked incessantly about my options. By the time the second day rolled around, I was convinced everybody had stopped listening to me.The job in New York would be difficult to walk away from. Both were excellent opportunities and I was incredibly lucky to have them. I could have taken either and done well for myself. Neither one of them was wrong.This was the first time in my life that I was presented with two open doors and I would be the one who got to decide which to walk through. But up until this point, I don’t think I knew Should I stay in New York, pursue a career and make a name for myself? Or should I fly to a different continent, travel, and pursue my personal goals and a less traditional career path? It was a classic case of having to choose between long-term and short-term benefits.I did a lot of reflection and, what I concluded was that, down the line, some late night at work, when my head begins to wander, it won’t be New York that I’m dreaming of. It will be the bright hues of Palawan, yurts in Mongolia, and Yacht Week in Croatia. It will be bowls of Indian curries, French cheeses, and Peruvian ceviche. It will be the sleepy mornings in crowded airports and the sweaty chicken buses in Mexico.It will be the adventures that were never had.Travel writer, photographer, and professional adventurer.

The day I quit, I decided I wanted an obvious sign and the first song on the album, “The first part of the song is a recording of a woman speaking, and the part that completely made me well up with tears in my cubicle (because I knew what it meant), was the following:About 30 minutes later, one of supervisors called me into their office to chat about some issues that had come up the weekend prior on one of the social media channels I was in charge of. Details aren’t important, just know that being a social media manager is a insanely difficult job — a delicate dance, if you will,  most people you work with won’t understand everything you do.The next thing I know, the following words released from my heart to my brain, and then came to life in my tear-choked voice:“Well, here’s the thing — I’m giving you my notice today. My last day will be February 28th.”And that was that. A month later, I left an incredibly secure job, I left a secure paycheck, secure healthcare, a secure 401k — but I was 100% ok to leave it.My first $20 after being self-employed!Security is comfort, and comfort make us lazy and complacent.I have no desire to have a secure, comfortable life. I want the challenging, gritty, curse-worthy, life — because, damn, I feel alive when I’m having a hard time.Which brings me to another thing that needs to be mentioned:I realize I could be calling myself out here, and yes, a couple years ago when working with influencers was fairly new, I worked with many brands, for free. Now, I don’t. If you see me promoting a brand, it’s because I really believe in 1) that brand as a company  love their product, 2) they are paying me, 3) I have an incredible relationship with them and am happy to promote. It’s not because I am greedy, it is because I simply don’t have the time to talk about random brands who send me things if they are not paying me, or I just won’t use or wear what they have sent me, even if they paid me.Social media is amazing (hello, it’s how I pay the bills), but like I said: the bubble is bursting and you really have to stand out and have more to offer than photos and the ability to hashtag. (Ok, back to how I am making things happen in my life:I get a lot of people are asking me, Chicago 2015Tokyo 2014Bali 2014Grand Canyon 2014San Francisco 2013It’s actually very simple, now that I’ve been doing it for a couple of months. In addition to being entirely independent — 29 with no family to care for (yet), here’s how I’ve been managing:Living paycheck to paycheck for my entire life, I never learned how to budget, because I never had enough money TO budget. I just paid whatever bills I could pay with each paycheck and then spent the rest.Now that I am being paid more and taxes are not taken out, I have to be incredibly careful with my money, but not in a worrisome way. I just plan better. I have to consider the fact that I need to pay taxes every quarter. I also have to consider that I might not have enough work in a few months, yet the bills will still need to be paid.I bank with You can also setup goals with future dates, and it will pull money each day from you “safe-to-spend,” balance, until that goal is fulfilled.

To Marius and Fleur, wherever you are now, I can’t thank you enough for what you did. The awesome couple you see pictured above found a GoPro I accidentally left in my rental car in Denmark. I was on a flight halfway to Oslo before I realized it was missing.In mid July I set out on a solo two week trip through England, Denmark and Norway for summer vacation. A friend let me borrow his GoPro so I could capture highlights of my trip and share it with friends when I got home in the U.S. Just 4 days into my trip and that plan was squashed when I arrived in Norway without the video camera.Weeks later I get an email from Enterprise Rent A Car in Copenhagen saying my GoPro turned up and they would ship it to Virginia where I live.Excited to see what footage I was able to capture before it was left behind in Denmark, I plugged the GoPro into my computer as soon as it arrived. The first thing I found was this note:Turns out the couple who turned the GoPro in to Enterprise, Marius and Fleur, used it to capture their Scandinavian road! While I was grateful for their integrity and stoked that they returned it, I was also pumped to hear that the camera made their trip that much more awesome. I e-mailed Marius and Fleur and thanked them for turning the GoPro in. I also left a similar note:There are still very awesome people in this world. Experiences like this remind me to keep paying it forward.Thank you Marius and Fleur. I hope you’re out there right now enjoying whatever adventure comes your way.Musician, Veteran, photojournalist, runner, wanderer

Dear Airbnb:I recently had the pleasure of getting to know you better through my travels in Southern Italy, and had some thoughts on how you could make your services better.First, can I give you some well-deserved kudos? This was the first time when we relied exclusively on Airbnb for the entire trip. We traveled for 1.5 weeks through Southern Italy which entailed tasting the BEST pizza we’ve ever had in Naples, wine tasting in the authentic, undiscovered Puglia region, and taking in the breathtaking views of the Amalfi coast.We were continually impressed by the hospitality of your hosts, lower price points with more geographic coverage, and the localness of the lodging that transported us to authentic Southern Italian living. Only through your platform could we experience hanging our laundry within an Italian family home and sleeping in Italian hobbit-houses (aka Trulli houses) distinct to the region.And all this wrapped up in hundreds of details that resulted in a delightful UX. Keep up the good work!Here was our use case: small group of friends traveling in an unfamiliar international location, with average length of 1–4 nights per place. In thinking about features that would’ve made our travel experience better, I group them into meeting at least one of these 2 goals:This goes to the heart of why a user chooses your services over others’. What pain points does Airbnb uniquely solve that other lodging services do not?This addresses reasons why a user would NOT choose your services over other substitutes. What pain points does a traveler incur because she chose Airbnb? If you truly want to disrupt hotels, there are aspects of your travel experience that needs to be brought on par with competitors’.The rest of this post will be dedicated to dissecting Goal #1 of enhancing the Airbnb experience, specifically thinking about the unique characteristics and ideas on how to build features for them. Goal #2 will be analyzed in all its glory in a subsequent post.There are many aspects of what makes Airbnb so unique compared to hotels. In adding up all these little details, one high-level theme emerged; the Airbnb experience is For starters, every place that we stayed at felt like a local could live there. Even comparing against vacation rental apartments or suites, the Airbnb units felt more local and full of character (both in good and bad ways :). Every unit had a different combination of amenities, location, and even neighbor considerations.Furthermore, even though all of the places that we stayed at were standalone units (not shared-with-host units), we had frequent interactions with the hosts throughout the entire trip lifecycle. Whereas with hotels you are dealing with a corporate entity, with Airbnb we were dealing with actual people with names and faces which made the experience more personal and fun.So how to enhance the social and personal nature of the Airbnb experience? Here are some thoughts.In the pre-trip phase, we found ourselves communicating frequently with the host and also within the travel group. Host communications consisted of a brief intro on ourselves followed by a back-and-forth on more info on the place and key handoff logistics. This experience felt relatively seamless on the Airbnb platform; communicating within the travel group was another story.Because each housing unit was different, we found ourselves with a bigger need for pre-planning coordination as decision-making was more complex. For example, place A = bigger and cheaper, but darker, older bathroom, and pets are allowed which means it might trigger our allergies vs. place B = light and airy with a nice bathroom, but smaller and the bed didn’t look comfortable. Contrast this against booking a room at a hotel or bb; the delta between room-to-room UX is narrower.We were using long email threads and text messaging for the purpose of coordinating all this. Instead, a collaboration tool to streamline the lodging decisions and purchases between the traveling group would’ve helped tremendously. Think TripIt for lodging planning, uniquely tailored for Airbnb:Once on the road, we found the Airbnb messaging tool to be indispensable for light concierge-esque requests like requesting a taxi and getting local pizzeria recommendations. If this messaging feature was a group chat between all travelers and the host, it would’ve been even more powerful for these reasons:You get the idea. Features that facilitate communication between all parties would make the Airbnb experience less stressful and more fun.To be honest, I think you have nailed this part of the experience. The double-rating, gentle prompting with a concrete 2-week time window, and controls for private and public feedback all result in giving useful and honest yet positive feel-good feedback for all.Currently living the #startuplife as a #femalefounder.

During the first Republican presidential candidates’ debate, It got me wondering: do people who have traveled more make better leaders? Do we, or should we, view a leader’s foreign policy differently if he or she has spent more time abroad?Since we couldn’t find a reliable data source for where the leading candidates have been, we set about collecting our own. We created a simple database using A picture started to emerge, and it wasn’t quite what we were expecting. You can see the full interactive maps The Donald trails the Jeb significantly in terms of countries visited. Bush has been to 43 countries compared to Trump’s 27. The next closest was Perry (24), Huckabee (23), Fiorina (16), Cruz (14), Christie (14), Kasich (14), Rubio (13), Walker (9), Paul (4), and Carson (2). (interactive map We thought Mexico or Canada was a safe bet. Instead Israel is the country that the most candidates have visited, with touchdowns from all except Trump and Kasich. Notably, it was the only country we could find that Ben Carson has been to outside of the US. (We haven’t heard back from our request for fact checking from Carson, so it’s entirely possible we’re missing something, please reach out if you have more info). (Perhaps because the candidates grew up during the height of the Cold War, almost none have been to the former USSR. Bush visited Armenia when it was part of the Soviet Union as part of a relief mission after a devastating earthquake in 1988. Kasich is the only candidate to have visited Russia proper. (China, our second largest trading partner after Canada, has had visits from five candidates: Bush, Fiorina, Rubio, Trump, and Walker. But every candidate has spent at least some time in the Middle East. Huckabee is the real standout here, with visits to nearly every country in the region. (At At the end of the day, travel experience is one of many, many things on which a candidate’s experience can be judged. There’s no guarantee that traveling improves a candidate’s fitness to lead our country. But thanks to this dataset, we can start to track what effect it may have — and perhaps encourage everyone, from the candidates to you who are reading this, to travel more.Nomad, nerd, travel evangelist.

The long term travel dream came first. “I want to travel; I want to see the world,” I said repeatedly to anyone who was within earshot. Every month or so I would play around on the websites of airlines that offered round the world (RTW) tickets. And each month my list of destinations grew. Buenos Aires to Patagonia, then to South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Kenya. Then I’d zip up to Iceland and over to Croatia before heading down to Southeast Asia where I’d go between Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. And then finally to Australia and New Zealand. The next month I’d see a picture of Machu Picchu and be reminded that I should add Peru to my list of destinations. And each month, as my list of destinations grew longer, the price of my dream RTW ticket would climb higher and higher. Which would reminded me, I’m dying to see the peaks of Mt. Everest and Mt. Kilimanjaro, so I should probably add Nepal and Tanzania to my itinerary.Do you see my problem?! Once you open yourself up the possibility of long term travel it is really easy to let the dream run away from you. At the rate I was going I’d be shelling out $15,000+ on plane tickets and boarding a plane to a new country every few weeks. I’d be broke before I departed and living at the mercy of my itinerary. And finally, after many months of dreaming this dream it hit me: I Instead, what I really value about traveling is settling in. Plop me down in the middle of a foreign country and let me learn something for myself. Let me learn that I’m pleasantly surprised by Bangkok’s public transit systems. Let me learn that a $12/night bungalow on a beach isn’t worth the spectacular views and the bragging rights if I don’t have running water (while I can tolerate mosquito netting and the lack of a fan, sometimes a girl just wants to flush the toilet and wash off the day’s sunscreen and the night’s bug spray in a cool shower). I love having the time to get lost in a new city and to enjoy a two-hour long cup of coffee. I like to travel slow — with great intention, but not an itinerary.So my plans evolved. What began as a round the world trip to check dream destinations off of a list evolved into a trip to travel slow  absorb countries and cultures as deeply as possible.To fully absorb a place — its people and its culture — I decided that I would need to stay in locations (be it a city or a country) for 3-5 weeks. But when I started to break those months down into weeks, weeks into days, and days into hours, I began to realize just how much time I would really have. Realize, but not truly fathom; not conceptualize.Like most people, I was used to having 10-15 hours of my day filled with “mandatory” activities. Whether it was the combination of school, soccer practice, then homework while in high school or simply just my full-time job in my adult life — the idea of having 9-12No job means that my time is mine and only mine.I have my savings, yes, but the money that leaves my bank account is no longer being replaced on a bi-weekly period (this is a thought that still terrifies me when I think about it for too long). And while I’ve mentally prepared myself to spend x amount of my savings, I’d like for that money to last as long as possible. Therefore, I won’t be checking 20 destinations off of my list, nor will I be filling my days with expensive activities and excursions.No friends that I’m traveling with, at least. And no friends means no commitments and no competing agendas. If I decide I want to stay someplace for three months, no problem! If I can’t stand the bungalow without running water, no problem — I’ll leave three days early! But traveling solo doesn’t mean I’m alone. Traveling solo means you open yourself up to small conversations that you might not otherwise. It means that you make friends while you go, but that you often find yourself leaving them behind for opposite destinations all too soon.No job. No income. No friends. An abundance of time.But I knew I could only be a tourist for so long. Following guide books and maps from one attraction to the next quickly becomes tiresome and expensive. And activities like scuba diving and island hopping are activities that I could perhaps participate in once every month or so, but certainly not five days a week. There are always personal hobbies that I could use to fill my days. One hobby that I have been excited to invest more time into is photography, but it is still not enough to fill my days and give me a sense of purpose. There was also reading to consider, but that’s not very social. I needed something more.Volunteering was something that I had previously looked into in passing, but the more I thought about it, volunteering became something that I wanted and needed to do. Volunteering would provide several benefits for me:When I talk about volunteering in developing countries it is important for me to state that my goal isn’t to save the world or even to save lives. My goals are far more selfish than that (and I believe that there is nothing wrong with being selfish if it also means I’m being realistic). My goals are to broaden my perspectives on the world and to continue my education outside of the classroom. My goal is to pursue passions and to open myself up to discover new ones. My goals are to experience the struggles around improving education in Laos or bringing clean water into homes in Ethiopia first-hand. My goals are to say that I’ve been there; I’ve experienced it and seen the struggles with my own eyes. I am of course hoping to make an impact, but I’m prepared for it to be a small one — as long as it’s positive and sustainable, I’ll consider it a victory.I’m not so naive as to think I’ll be the one who ends hunger in Africa or solves for clean water in India. But if I can feel someone’s struggles then I can empathize with their pain and I can advocate on their behalf and I can make a choice to live my life differently. And just like that, volunteering became something that I knew would define my trip.Traveling slowly around the world.

This week we had the pleasure of interviewing Chris Stevens of Before I hit the road I had just finished a degree in photography and ran my own wedding photography company. After I came back from my first year of traveling in Australia I worked for STA Travel UK for a year and then quit and hit the road long term!Indeed, I’ve juggled heaps of stuff! Challenge wise I think diving was the most difficult — being a dive master isn’t the easiest job in the world but it is heaps of fun! As for memorable being paid to be an extra in a nudist movie is always a good drinking story.I went to Ecuador to shoot an eco surfing piece in my final year of university and it was my first real long haul solo trip — I barely even knew where the country was before jumping on the plane! I met so many epic people during that trip and had such a blast that it certainly planted the seed to bounce out of the UK I guess I just want to show people the world and inspire them to go out and explore it for themselves. Tips wise people have heaps of reasons of why they think they can’t travel — but I want to show people that it doesn’t cost millions of pounds, it isn’t super difficult and help answer some of the questions they may have about planning a trip.I’m a huge advocate of technology and if that allows me to work from a beach in Peru over an office in the UK then I’m totally going to make the lifestyle adjustments to make it happen! I have such a better lifestyle balance on the road and I’m far happier for it.Getting a stable income was always a major worry and to be honest I didn’t set out to do what I did, I just kind of stumbled into it! There was no business plan, just a blog and an adventure which was meant to involve a working holiday visa in New Zealand…which STILL hasn’t happened!I think the biggest learning curve was self-discipline on juggling work and play. I still haven’t got it right and surfing and exploring certainly wins out most of the time…but I’m getting there!The biggest advantage is the flexibility — I work when I want but more importantly FROM where I want — if I fancy a few months in Asia I don’t need to book time off, as long as I have wi-fi its life as normalAgain it’s finding the balance — there are some days where I have to force myself to sit down in front of my laptop for the entire day to catch up! One of my most productive times is on long haul flights and trains though — I guess they’re almost like my office space now!Launching my online travel agency — If you can see a way of earning on the road take the leap — worse comes to worst you go home and start again!Live the AdventureLife Unleashed: Connect, live, work … Anywhere.

What my favourite film director taught me about my job.I have had ”writing a screenplay” on my bucket-list for quite a while. And directing the actual movie, but let’s take it one step at a time… When someone asks me who my favorite photographer is, I get reminded of how little I know about other photographers and their work. For some reason, i don’t read too much about them, I don’t look at too many photo books. I tend to find inspiration in other places — like movies!And I have a few favorites in that area. Whenever Wes Anderson releases a new film, I know it is going to be extremely entertaining. And here’s what Wes Anderson taught me about travel photography:If you would cut out the part where the three brothers in the movie Darjeeling Limited were traveling, you would end up with a very short — and extremely uninteresting — flick. But when most of us are moving from point A to point B, we forget to actually experience and explore during this time. It is just dead time, that we have to endure. Dude! Every person you meet has been through as much as you have, and has thousands of stories and tips to tell you. Every second your train or bus is passing new places- so don’t miss out!Next time you find yourself doing nothing on a bus, turn to the guy next to you and say hello. You don’t even need to know the same language; communication and conversation is always an option. (Extra points for traveling in a suit and tie.)You remember the angry chief steward in Darjeeling Limited? Or Zero, the lobby boy in Grand Budapest Hotel? You will always run into their likes when traveling. Make sure to be nice to them, they deserve it and reply in kind. They are the ones able to upgrade your hotel room, hook you up with the right people and point you in the right direction. They live at the place you are visiting and they tend to know a lot of people (much better than you do).A few years ago, I was staying in a guest house in Pushkar, a holy city in the west of India. Being a holy city also means that both meat and alcohol is forbidden (apparently, pot is totally ok — special chocolate balls anyone?). I don’t have to have meat in my food, but it is hard to manage the amazing sunset on top of the house without at least one cold Kingfisher beer. Thanks to the hotel manager, I found out that just a few meters outside the city borders — there’s quite a few places where you can stock up on the forbidden items. He even lent me his moped as a get-away (and get-back) vehicle.Besides the train train steward and Zero, do you remember the scout leader in Moonlight Kingdom? Steve Zissou in Life Aquatic? And Max Fisher in Rushmore? If you have seen the movie, you will most certainly remember. And even if you haven’t there is a big chance that you will. Anderson puts huge efforts into building his characters (even though he says that he’s not particularly bothered or concerned with details- yeah right) to make them unique. For him, the most important part in a movie is the characters — not the plot.Each person is a story. Getting close to people is very hard, even frightening. If you manage to understand how to do that, you will be able to tell their story to everyone that is looking at your shots.That is part of an actual quote from Wes (yeah, we’re on first name basis now).Adapt that mind set, wherever you go. The brain is a funny thing. You know when you try to force yourself to remember a certain word (“I’ve got it on the tip of my tongue..”) you never manage. But when you stop trying, it will suddenly pop up. The same goes for taking photos. If you are dashing out of the hotel like a predator with a camera, you’ll end up having to go back a few hours later with your tail between your legs — if you are trying too hard, you’ll block your own creativity.Here’s an alternative: Instead, let IT come to YOU. Learn to recognize the small lightbulb that goes of in your head whenever something interesting pops up in your periphery vision. THIS is when you should remember that you are actually carrying a camera.Anderson is well-known for casting his movies out of a small pool of actors that he’s been working with over and over again. The Wilsons, Bill Murray and Anjelica Huston appear in several of his motion pictures. This goes against the common misconception that when you’ve done something once, you’ll need to do it vastly different the next time.Today, everyone is trying to go viral — and to do that you need to do something never seen before. I’m not saying you shouldn’t try to go viral and be seen by doing some supercool marketing stunt- but in order to make people stay with you after the tweets and reposts start fading, you need a genuine body of work. You could probably show me any still from any of Wes Anderson’s movies and I’d be able to recognize that it is his. His characters, his way of shooting (a lot of shots where the motif is perfectly centered — take that, Rule Of Thirds!), the music and most of all — the colors. In a time when everyone is doing everything and all the time, the more you’ll be able to tie a specific kind of style to your work — the more people will remember you.Whenever Anderson releases a new movie, he knows that there will be a few really bad reviews. Once he claimed that he never ever received a great review, just fifty shades of good and bad. But nevertheless, millions of people still love his films; so how do a few bad reviews from a few people make a difference? The funny thing is, for someone to really hate something you did, he’ll have to let it in. He’ll have to become affected by it. And isn’t that what art and photography is all about? Making an impact? Learn to take criticism and turn it to something good.Don’t take yourself too seriously. Don’t take other people too seriously. We tend to forget that every person we meet is just that: a person. Same as you. Make people laugh, and they will trust you.Jens Lennartsson: Travel photographer, minimalist. Co-founder of the Scandinavian Publishing house New Heroes  Pioneers.

Traveling doesn’t feel like it used to. I remember visiting Mexico or Hong Kong on family vacations as a child and having a sense of wonder and newness, but now they feel like rather similar places with different food. Some of this may be growing up, but a lot of it is how I’ve started experiencing travel in the always-connected, staring-at-my-phone world. So much of my day has the same routine as home (checking email, Facebook, the news, messaging the same people, and thinking about my future) that no wonder I feel like not much has changed. I’ve been experimenting with ways to fix this and fully be present when traveling. Here are some techniques I’ve found —The first step is disconnecting from the world. I’ve banned myself from using all non-messaging, maps, and journaling apps anytime during the day (i.e. social networks, email, shopping — anything I would stare at in downtime to escape my so-called boring situation). After I wake up and before bed, I’m allowed to use my phone with abandon. This has gone a long way to keeping myself from following the same routine I do at home.I recently finished Dr. Rick Hanson’s fantastic Remembering and invoking these techniques throughout the day has further helped me experience each moment of my travel, and perhaps more importantly, helped create and cement very vivid and positive memories.NYU CS, CTO at Branch, engineering at Facebook, now roaming the world.

Solo travel might seem like a fearsome idea to many women travelers, but with so many countries and safe destinations out there, the world is not as scary as one might think.Travelling safe is mostly about being cautious and taking some smart safety measures. Solo travelers, both women and men, must accept the reality that there are places all over the world where one might face the risk of thieves, pickpockets and burglars.But for those who want an extra bit of assurance, the World Economic Forum has published a Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index report, in which countries are ranked on the basis of their economy, tourism and safety of the tourists. To add to this, there is also the rankings made by the Global Peace Index report which ranks the nations of the world according to their level of peacefulness.Keeping in the ranking report in mind, we’ve listed the top six safest places for women to travel around the world:Famous for its art-filled cities like Helsinki and Turku, Finland is ranked number one for safety and security in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness index. The capital city of Helsinki, which is widely known for its architectural buildings, art-galleries and museums is the main point of visit for many travelers. Some of the other places to visit in Finland are Hameenlinna, Jyväskylä, Lemmenjoki National Park, Archipelago National Park, Lake Saimaa and Savonlinna.Iceland is ranked number one in the Global Peace Index of 2015. A land of natural wonders, Iceland is known for its amazing scenic beauty. It is popular for Europe’s largest national park — the Vatnajolkull National Park with a huge glacier inside it. Reykjavik, Lake Myvatn Geo-thermal Area, Skaftafell Park, Asbyrgi Canyon and Hornstrandir Nature Reserve are the places you shouldn’t miss in Iceland.Denmark is the fifth best country in the world for gender equality according to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap 2014 report. It is also ranked second according in the Global Peace Index 2015. Both these rankings prove that Denmark is a great place to travel solo and enjoy the enjoy this beautiful Nordic country. Historic attractions like Tivoli Gardens, Gefion Fountain and Kronborg Castle in the capital city of Copenhagen are some of the best places to visit in the country.The next country on our list, New Zealand, is one of the leading nations in the Safety and Security in Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index and has ranked fourth in the Global Peace Index report of 2015. It provides accommodations to cater to solo woman travelers and women travel groups. The country is one of the hotspots for adventurous sports like water rafting, lugging, jet boating, heli-skiing, skydiving, and mountain biking. Auckland, Lake Taupo, Tongariro National Park, Queenstown, Abel Tasman National Park, Abel Tasman Coast Track and Rotorua are some of the places in New Zealand that are worth a visit.Famous for its multiculturalism, the people of Canada have the reputation of being one of the most friendliest in the world. It is also among the top ten countries in the Global Peace Index. Niagra Falls, Quebec City, Banff National Park and the Rocky Mountains, Bay of Fundy, Gros Morne National Park, Victoria’s Inner Harbour and Old Montreal are some of the best attractions of the country.A land of charming sceneries, scenic Alps, beautiful blue lake valleys and glaciers, Switzerland ranks fifth in the Global Peace Index and number two in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness index. This European country is also famous for its historic buildings, galleries, renowned music festivals and excellent museums like Rietberg Museum, Kunst Fine Arts Museum and Swiss National Museum. Well known for skiing, forests, castles, mountain resorts, chocolates, cheese, clocks, modern and ancient architecture, Switzerland has a low crime rate and is one of the safest countries in the world. Mount Pilatus, The Jungfrau Region, Chillon Castle, Swiss Natural Park and the Rhine Falls are places and sites one must definitely see.Limitless is here to spread knowledge into the information age, because information may provide data, but knowledge can free your mind.Curated Writings where Information becomes Knowledge.

There’s far too much to see.Sometimes, there’s an innate feeling of knowing what you’re born to do. Here’s why some are born to travel.You know this person — they always want to go somewhere, see some place, eat somewhere, go to this hill station, visit that lake. People who are born to travel are characteristically restless because there’s always more to do, more to see and more to be for them in this life. The clock is ticking and they just have to make the most of their time, even it means one-way flights.People who are born to travel have the nagging sense of knowing that where they are is not enough, even if it’s one of the greatest cities in the world. They are aware of how little they know about the world and they are focused on wanting to learn and understand the world that exists beyond theirs.They want it all — the sights, the food, the people, everything. They know that every place in the world retains its own individual authenticity, that eating Korean fried chicken in New York is not the same as eating it in Korea. And when do go to Korea for that fried chicken, you’ll be sure to see a slew of pictures with friends they made there, completely out of the blue.People who are born to travel don’t ‘plan’ a trip.

My wife, son and I just returned from a 5-month trip. We spent most of this time sailing a boat from Grenada to the Virgin Islands. Just the three of us — it was an amazing, inspiring, awesomely fun I had several I read a book recently called “I’m an entrepreneur. I’ve been able to make a great career, despite the fact that I didn’t go to school to study to be an entrepreneur or even learn about business (secret: my math skills weren’t good enough to get into business school). I learned most everything I know about my profession by jumping in and muddling through.And although my 20 years of traditional education taught me a great deal, I actually had to unlearn a couple of things from school that would have held me back from success. I wrote about these lessons Thus, we looked at the opportunity to take Jimmy out of his 7th grade classroom for a semester as a challenge. How could we best compliment his ongoing public education? How could we develop those non-cognitive skills and provide him with the best opportunity for adult success?I’m not an expert in education and I don’t pretend to know all of the answers. But here are a few things that we experimented with that seemed to work.What do you want to learn? Pick a few things that really interest you. Jimmy picked fishing. He picked learning about sharks and the other creatures that live in the Ocean and on the islands of the Caribbean. He picked investing and the stock market. And we also encouraged him to ask questions about the world around him and we would help him figure out how to answer those questions.Hidden lesson: don’t wait for others to tell you what is important. Go out and do what interests you. Find out stuff that you have a “knack” for doing. And do more that stuff.We have a box of old encyclopedias in the room above our garage. That’s where I was forced to go for answers when I was thirteen. Today, we have the Internet. Anything you want to learn, you can. Never in the history of the world has it been easier to follow your interests to become an expert in something.Throughout our trip, we researched questions that came up, like tides and weather and Communism and Darwin’s Theory of Evolution. Why does Apple make so much money? Why is the Ocean blue? Why do my ears pop underwater? Those are great questions Jimmy. Let’s figure them out. And we also tried to be proactive in certain subjects rather than just reactive to specific questions. We subscribed to podcasts. Jimmy learned the ukulele from YouTube videos. We signed up for online courses on physics and computer programming. And although we didn’t get around to doing ½ of the stuff I’d hoped to accomplish (like learning to program), I think all of this demonstrated to Jimmy that there is a big, amazing world out there that he can dive into anytime he wants.Before this trip, Jimmy’s life was organized into pretty tight segments. School time, homework time, and all that other time when he didn’t have to learn anything and was free to actually have fun. We turned this upside down on our trip. Sure, we had a few set school tasks to keep Jimmy up on his cognitive skills like math, reading comprehension and writing, but we kept scheduled school time to a minimum.Instead, we tried to weave learning into just a normal part of each day. A great example of this is something that we did for entertainment. Because we didn’t have T.V. or Internet often, I downloaded A lot of the things that I’ve achieved in life have been the result of calculated, thoughtful risk taking. I bet you can say the same. Yet why is it that in the U.S. we work so hard to completely take our kids out of managing any risk in their lives? Many of us would put our kid in a giant protective bubble if we could. I think it’s a big mistake. Kids are capable of much more than we sometimes give them credit.We saw this first hand during our time on the Island of Dominica. Dominican kids are treated like little adults. For example, many of these kids receive a machete before they turn 10. A big, sharp machete. Yet, we didn’t see a single kid missing a finger or hand or worse from this responsibility. They step up to the responsibility and they become very confident in the process. Jimmy took a lot of To be exceptional at something you must, by definition, be outside the norm. Yet, as social creatures, we feel a tremendous obligation to fit in. To go along. In most professions, just fitting in isn’t going to get you very far. And finding true happiness in life often involves having the guts to write your own script. Our trip was a bit crazy and atypical. It was really different. And not only did it show Jimmy how big the world is, I think it has also given him the permission and freedom to be different when he so chooses. To put another way, I listened to a We didn’t explicitly set out to try to teach Jimmy empathy on our trip — it just sort of happened. Looking back it makes sense. We met people from all walks of life: All sorts of different ages, income levels, nationalities, ethnic backgrounds, and cultural backgrounds. We ate and I don’t want to paint too rosy of a picture here. Not everything we did worked. Hardly. The best example of this is probably my efforts to instill in Jimmy the value of deferred gratification (doesn’t it feel better to play on your phone It hasn’t turned out that way. Left to his own devices, I’m pretty sure he would play video games and binge watch Netflix all day. Perhaps I had too high of expectations for a 13 year old. Perhaps I just need to give him the control to be a slacker for a week or two and miss accomplishing things. I’m not sure of the answer, but I wanted to point out that we don’t have one yet. All of this is a work in progress.Parents can be divided up many different ways, but here let’s divide them into two groups: those who continually work to become better at the job of parenting, and those who do not. My guess is that any parent reading this post falls into the former camp. And I hope that I’ve inspired you and perhaps given you some new things to try in your quest to give your kid the best chance of being a success.To that end, here are a few specific ideas.Go out and do something with your kid in the real world. Sign up for a volunteer experience. Road trip to a new town for the day. Visit a museum (yawn). Get outside of your day-to-day routine together. Doing this has two huge benefits: a) it shows your child that you care about them with your actions; and, b) it enables them to learn how I just finished an inspiring book about death. That might sound impossible, but Peter Barton, the former CEO of Liberty Media pulled it off in “Resist the temptation to put your child in bubble wrap. Seriously. Financial risk, bodily risk, emotional risk. Let them quit something. Buy them a lottery ticket with their piggy bank money if that’s what they want. Do something physically challenging that takes courage. Give them something that they view as dangerous. Take We watched an amazing movie the other night called “Just what does that mean, an intellectual household? To me, it means that as a parent you remain relentlessly curious about the world and that you share this curiousness and what you learn with your kids. Ironically, that is what I was trying to do while watching Here’s an easy way to get started. On your way home from work ask yourself, what did I learn today? And then share that with your kids at dinner.One thing I’m going to do this summer — paint one of our kitchen walls with In closing, I’ll respond to what many of you are thinking — I don’t have the luxury of time to do all of this stuff. And some of you may not. But I’d challenge you to really think about how you spend the hours of each day. Here’s a personal example. If you are like me, you’ve probably invested a great deal in your kid’s athletic career. You’ve paid for camps. You’ve driven everywhere, even across state lines. You’ve sat on the sidelines. Hours and hours and hours of time. Don’t get me wrong, I love sports and I think they have a lot to teach kids. Athletics and exercise are a huge part of my life. But think about this time and whether you could take just a small portion of it to do some of the things you’ve come up with from this post. And then ask yourself which set of hours will have a bigger long-term impact.Bottom line, even if everything you try fails miserably, your child will be left with the most important belief of all — that you care deeply about them and tried your best. Anything else is really just extra.*Caveats:I apologize for doing a When I criticize our educational system, I’m talking about the Entrepreneur.

We LOVE traveling. For our It obviously crossed our minds to bring a family member or close friend but we needed to bring someone who we could “boss around”. We didn’t want to feel bad each time we asked them to stay home with the kids or help us pick up around the house.Garrett grew up with a nanny. I did not. And I was Our plan was to pay for all travel expenses, food and housing. That’s it. I didn’t think we’d have much response. Garrett had reached out to a gal we both followed on Instagram who was a great photographer from Hawaii — That next Sunday was SO… let me tell you a little about how this is working. Bree and Seek are both great with kids and come from huge families. The extra hands and protection make me feel so much more confident traveling with kids. They are super kind, generous and laid back. No one has anything bad to say about them. Their little boy Sylver is the same age as Dorothy and is her new BFF. The first time they met they each had ring pops and gummies to gift each other (just to make sure things started on the right foot ;) I will love having someone for Dorothy to play with and need to share with to keep her from being spoiled. I think they will both push each other to learn, swim and be more adventurous. For me, the benefits of having an extra toddler by far outweigh the disadvantages. Bree is a great photographer and Seek is a skilled videographer. With that combo, our trip will be so well documented! Lastly, we love traveling with friends. More people to share the adventure with! :)Worst comes to worst we have set things up and both agreed before hand that if it isn’t a good fit then no worries, we can part ways at anytime. If it is a good fit, GOOD TIMES AHEAD!! Life’s blessings are always best when shared with others.This situation is new and different. It doesn’t make much sense but it also makes perfect sense. I believe God put both of our families on the same path for the next few months and we are SO excited to see what’s in store.Sincerely,Adventure Journalist traveling the world with my 

I can’t go travelling — I’ve got no one to go with.Bullshit! This common excuse of cancelling the plans of seeing the world is the worst. Two of the best things about travelling are adventure and freedom. By travelling alone, you will not have to compromise either. No one can replace you. You are the best partner you will ever have! So, go SOLO instead of postponing a trip because you can’t find a travelling partner.We are all surrounded by people in our day to day lives who work with us, socialise with us daily. We also need a break from them and travelling solo is the perfect way to go. You can know yourself better, leave your comfort zone and go into the wild, get to know other people, hike, dance, smile, talk to strangers, eat new food, learn a lot of things and maybe even see the sunrise on the beach.I planned on going for a vacation after a very long time and had to take a really tough decision of whether to go alone or not. Thanks to one of my friends who motivated me enough to go solo, as he had done the same just a week or two before me, and according to him it was the most amazing experience.Goa was the place I travelled to. Even though this place is known for it’s party culture, I decided to go there alone because —So, if you plan to travel to India anytime in future, Goa needs to be on the top of your list.I had already booked a room in I reached the hostel at around 7:00 am. Chilled out place, nice location, cheerful and helpful staff and best of all, affordable! The room was pretty decent with clean beds, a bathroom and a personal locker. There were three people already there sleeping as it was early in the morning. It was really weird at the beginning, as the thought of sharing a room with three people who I have never met or spoken to was making me uncomfortable. I knew most of them were solo travellers just like me, which eventually made me talk to them. This is the best part about travelling alone, you get to meet people just like you and this leads to some of them becoming very good friends also.I got ready and went down to the living area of the hostel where mostly people just chill with a pint of beer, watch TV, talk or play with the pet cat they have. Living area was the place where interaction with other guests in the hostel used to happen. I myself got the chance to interact with a lot of people from different countries. You get to know a lot actually — different cultures around you, exposure to new ideas, increased knowledge, better understanding of life and much more. As it was my first solo trip, for me this was something really fascinating and exciting. I enjoyed each and every bit of it! Eventually, I made some friends and spent a lot of time with them.We all used to take off individually during the day to explore different places in Goa. Later in the evening we all used to get together to tell our tales of the day, over drinks obviously.The first thing I learned about solo travelling is that, wherever you go, get yourself a room in a hostel. They are fun and affordable places to live where people from different parts of the world can interact, bond, learn and inspire each other. A solo trip in particular is sure shot to have amazing and lasting benefits. Travelling solo forces you to step out of your comfort zone, make decisions and most importantly, independent. This will never happen if you are travelling in a group. Here are some of the benefits of travelling alone —You are able to whatever you want. No need to coordinate with a companion and devote time to another persons needs before you. Wake up early, or sleep till noon; Dine in with linen and china, or eat at a corner greasy spoon; Go to an art gallery, or visit the market instead. When you travel solo, you can make the most out of your journey by reflecting your style and preferences.There will be lots of alone time for yourself, but you will never feel alone. This would be the time to reflect and test yourself. You will have a lot of time to dedicate to the things you actually enjoy. Whether it’s relaxing with a book, photography, listening to music, playing the guitar or even running. For me it’s more time to write my journal and try out my luck in photography. It’s good to have time for yourself specially when you are working and interacting with your colleagues and friends daily. Alone time is When you are in a group, you are not that approachable. Other travellers will be reluctant to come up and talk to you, because you look…mmm, kind of busy. Travelling alone means being away from your normal group of friends. You will definitely be more eager to meet and talk to locals or other travellers. You will probably find that more backpackers will strike up conversation with you. All you have to do is wander into a hostel common room and start a conversation with someone — it really is that easy!This obviously depends on person to person. When I travel alone, I spend less money. I have no problem in eating street food, I live in hostels and instead of buying expensive beer from the pubs, I prefer buying cheap beer from the wine and beer shops. Same can be the case with you. But travelling alone can save a lot of money as compared to travelling in a group as you can spend your money exactly the way you want. You are also more likely to buy less souvenirs and useless gadgets.You will start understanding yourself on a level you probably didn’t even know existed. Once you set off on a solo trip to an unknown place, you are on your own, all the decisions are up to you, and hence, you start listening to your heart. You will start discovering things about yourself that you probably weren’t even aware of before stepping out of your comfort zone. I, for one, had no idea that I could spend hours staring at the sea, writing stuff and just relax. I always thought of me as a person who needs to do something or the other to pass time. I never realised how much I enjoy my own company! God damn it! I am awesome!!If you take the decision of travelling alone, you have no excuse at all! Find a world map, spin a globe, open your atlas. I don’t care how you do it! It can be anywhere, maybe it’s somewhere you’ve always wanted to go. Maybe it’s somewhere obscure you’ve never heard of. Whatever your choice, choose a destination. There can never be a wrong answer to this. Do some research. Book your ticket. Just do it! Because Just do yourself a favour — Go Solo!!!Dreaming…

On a recent trip to a few European cities I dramatically improved my experience by leveraging location-based apps. In this post, I’ll share the best travel app use cases I discovered to help you get more value out of your next trip.Finding quality places to eat, drink, and sightsee multiple times a day in a new city can be a hassle. To solve that problem, I made Using my Foursquare list, I visited places located in the same area of a city in a single outing. I would typically start the day by picking a closely located An important part of my trip was learning about how people live in other cities. Using As a music nerd, I love seeing concerts by artists that I listen to, so I included the cities I was visiting in the To save money on costly roaming data and locate where I was, even without cellular data access, I created offline maps of the regions I was visiting using Google Maps.I also found it helpful to “save” my Airbnb host’s address (as well as other points of interest) for quick access within the app.It sucks to unexpectedly get caught in bad weather in a new city, so I used the Yahoo Weather iOS App to set up “Daily Notifications” in the morning and evening to stay informed. It’s also possible to add upcoming cities if you want to keep track of the weather a few days in advance of your visit.While out drinking, I used I hope you found some of these tips useful for travelling to a new city with a smartphone!

It’s about finding your own way to enjoy the journey no matter what happensI am a backpacking junky.In my last trip, I thought I should just skip planning and go with the flow since I’d always diverged from plans in my past experience.Knowing only the hostel I would be heading and nothing beyond that, I was a bit nervous when I embarked on the journey. However, it was quickly overpowered by burning excitement deep inside that couldn’t wait to unfold upcoming adventures.In a hind sight, having no plan is actually a pretty awesome plan.When you have no plan, your priority is to gather information so that you are able to make informed decision for your next move. What’s better way than asking people with first hand information?Ditch ‘Lonely Planet’ and talk to people.The first friend I make is usually cab driver from airport transfer or hotel receptionist. I would get tips from them about best local foods, hang out spot and also how to get around without getting conned.The other good source is fellow travellers who would share with you their travel itinerary. A simple act of asking often leads to sharing of personal stories or even meeting travel partners for part of your journey.It was amazing how no plan had lead to fun experience with people I met at different places.When you travel to a new place, all you want to do is to explore and hope that you see the most authentic DNA of the city.Some days, you just walk out and let your guts navigate you around. You experience the smell in the air, the sound, the surrounding, the language, the interaction between people with all your senses.The excitement in discovering new things around you makes you feel alive and present.It’s refreshing to break free from your usual routine and be in the state where you would ask yourself,’ what do I feel like doing right now?’ And then you do just that.A travel guide is created by someone who has explored a place. We could choose to repeat what people have done, or we could create our own footprint in a new place.What if you choose to take the longer route to reach a place? Purposely make a wrong turn? Or go into a shop just because it looks interesting?You will come to realise that you have full mastery of your life when you are in charge of every single decision throughout the journey. Sometimes you might end up in a dead end or tried some really horrible food but you know what? You learn and you move on.Travelling without a plan enables you to craft your own unique story when you travel.Without any preplanning and pre booking, it is almost impossible to be stuck in a bad plan.I love how I can literally make decision based on random factors such as mood and weather.If the accommodation sucked, you can always switch to a new one on second night. If you came across an exciting exhibition or concert that wasn’t mentioned in your guidebook, you can choose to extend your stay and check it out.Without a fixed schedule, your journey can be fluid and dynamic. You are constantly absorbing new information and adjusting your to-do or to-go list.You can always pivot until you get the best experience out of it.When there is no plan, you could observe how you reach a decision and the pattern of your thought process.It is common for travellers to face difficulties while in a place where you have no contact or resources. But it is not the plan that matters; it’s about finding your own way to enjoy the journey no matter what happens.Whatever the outcome is, you know you make your own choice and you embrace it with gratefulness. In the end, you are going to learn as much about yourself as the new place you were in.It is a breakaway from old environment where we could learn to appreciate abundance in life and broaden our perspective. It is about turning things around when shit happens.The bigger the world we see, the bigger our heart is, the more we can give.Co-founder @This is a collection for general writing, thinking, and opinions.

Yep, it’s been one year. One crazy year. I left Latin America. I’m back home in France. And I’m thinking about 9 things I didn’t know this time last year.I spent the first 3 months of my trip arriving each week in a new town with my shiny backpack, smiling to everyone and taking pictures of old churches. Like a tourist. But I was no tourist. Hell no. I was a traveler. I hitchhiked, I tried to talk to people in their language, I hanged out with locals.Then I met travelers. Real ones. Hardcore travelers. And I understood I was no traveler. Compared to them, I was just a long-term tourist moving around on low budget trying to blend into the local culture. But I also understood what a traveler really was.It’s a mindset.I left San Francisco for this Latin America trip with this idea in mind: I have one year. I’ll reach the southernmost tip of South America in one year, then I’ll go back home to my real life to finish my studies.And that’s a tourist mindset. After those 3 months I started questioning myself about that “real” life. Was I obligated to go back? Does “go back” even make any sense? I like my current lifestyle on the road, could that actually be my “real” life?And things started to change. I stopped traveling for the sole purpose of traveling — discovering new places, meeting interesting people, having new experiences. I stopped thinking that I was actually And that’s the traveler mindset. Your new lifestyle is called the road, and you embrace it.I’ll never forget During this year of travel I’ve met a lot of people, to be honest only one particular type of people, called strangers, but a whole bunch of them. And I discovered that with these people, it’s either there or it’s not, whatever “it” is.And when it’s there, it’s momentary and magical, it’s impossible to explain, but you both just know. It’s a hug that lasts longer than it should. It’s a 4-second eye contact. It’s a conversation that flows easily and naturally. It just happens.We have friends who remain, friends who come in our lives but then leave and friends who just pass by our daily lives. I recently read a quote that went something like “People come into your life for a reason, a season, or a lifetime.” Sometimes we are welcomed by friendships that aren’t meant to last forever. We know you won’t see some of them again forever. It’s sad, but it’s just life. Appreciate the magical moment you had with this friend, and keep the special memory of it in your mind.I went to a fair amount of dangerous shit holes in Central America. And what I found out is that the majority of people are good people, even in the most dangerous places. Most of the people I’ve met are extremely polite and helpful. They are generally interested in why I chose to visit their home. They are eager to assist if it’s obvious I’m lost or in trouble. They’ll go out of their way to try to make sure I have a good stay in their country.So go out, travel, and talk to people. Ask them questions like a 4-year-old would, get to know them. Everybody has a path, a story to tell, a beautiful smile to offer, an emotional moment to share. Open your mind and get ready to receive it. There’s little to no downside and can have huge impacts for the rest of your life.When you live your daily routine, you get the unrealistic impression that all of the little things matter. If you accidentally piss off a coworker, you’ll be nervous each time you see him, and it’ll be awkward, and he’ll notice the awkwardness which will make him hate you more, and that’ll just make it more awkward, and because of that he’ll hate you even more and it will be horrible, and please, let me stay in bed and watch TV shows forever.But when you travel, you can’t avoid embarrassing yourself. I once told my French friend that our Mexican Couchsurfer host’s house didn’t smell good, when our host suddenly said that he spoke French too. Oops.These things happen. But the world moves on. What may seem like a suicide-inducing embarrassment for you is nothing but a non-relevant incident for the people around you. Or as David Foster Wallace put it, “You’ll stop worrying what others think about you when you realize how seldom they do.” It’s a lesson that’s hard to learn sitting comfortably at home, and spending your life shuttling between the same three or four locations every day.And this is extremely liberating. It means you don’t need to be afraid to do something you think will seem stupid, because people forgive and people forget. It means that there’s absolutely no reason to not be the person that you want to be. There is no one to please. There is no one to impress. There is no one to be afraid of. Most of the time, it’s just you, yourself and the stories you invent in your mind.Our society is pretty into the words “To-Do”. They indicate action and an end goal. They indicate we get shit done. Even while traveling, we talk about our “bucket list”: doing the Great Wall, finishing that book, getting the stamp in the passport… It’s a never-ending list to To-Dos. And we think we are productive like this.Well, I learned how to be unproductive. I learned how to spend time not “doing something”, but simply “being”. I once traveled with this Mexican hippie dude, and, even though we weren’t stressed or anything, we meditated every single night, just sitting there and trying to feel all we can around us with our 5 senses. The last time before this trip I drew something was at age 14, and this time I bought a drawing book and sketched many times without purpose. I spent a lot of time in nature.And I tried to find a balance between being and doing. Ironically, I’ve never accomplished more in my life.Before I started traveling, I was a picky eater. My mom would tell me I was too meticulous and I wouldn’t care. Anytime someone asked me to give something a shot, I would tell them “No, I don’t like that”, even though I had never tried it.I went out on this trip with this too famous “life begins at the end of your comfort zone” quote in mind. I was up to try just about anything. I experimented with living in new places, hanging out with new people, imbibing new substances, and playing with new people’s orifices.And today, I wouldn’t mind eating any kind of food. According to my mom, that’s the biggest change she sees in me after one year traveling.I also changed my opinion about bisexuality, the Russian government and my career. I changed my lifestyle (see point #7). I changed the way I think about Latin people. I changed a couple of other things.And there’s no good or bad in the changes I made. It’s not worse before and better now. It’s just different. The only good thing happening is the Go to school, get a job, meet your future partner, get a dog, get married, buy a house, and have a baby or three. That’s all you need to do in order to lead a happy and successful life.Good thing is nobody believes this shit. Bad thing is everyone is living it. Yeah, including you. Which step are you at?Conformists are brought up by conformists who were brought up by conformists. If you dare to stray off that path and start your own trail, people will question you frowning their eyebrows: “Are you sure you want to invest all your time and money to build a startup? Are you crazy to go travel the world?”Once you start going down that trail, you’ll meet other non-conformists. In essence, they’re just like you. Working, living their little life. They are happy and successful, but based upon their own definition, not the one I gave 3 paragraphs above.Being a non-conformist doesn’t mean you can’t have a 9–5 job, a cute little garden and a family of 5, and this message isn’t intended to encourage you to So decide for yourself what you want to get out of life. Because if you don’t decide for yourself, someone else will end up deciding for you.Okay, chances are you might not know exactly what you want in life. In this case,This blog post is about things long-term traveling taught me. Well, one of these things is that long-term traveling teaches you things.Mine taught me the 9 points on this list. You may or may not agree with what I say, I don’t mind. I’m only telling you that you will have your own list of 9 things.Because traveling gives you a higher perspective on life. You ask things about yourself. You discover things about yourself. You realize things about yourself.And that’s priceless.That’s why I would advice anyone who’s asking herself what she should do with her life to take the plunge and go traveling, especially if she’s still young and lack the major responsibilities that come along with life. Go do that 4-month humanitarian project in Nepal you’ve always kept in a corner of your head. Buy a one-way ticket to Rio de Janeiro, settle yourself there and see how you turn out after 3 months. Buy a van and make a road trip across Australia.At the end of the day, what’s the worst that can happen? You don’t like it? No problem, just come home knowing that you gave it a shot.Or you love it. You discover things about yourself. You realize things about yourself. And you’re forever changed.Take that risk.You wouldn’t believe it, but out of all challenges I’ve encountered on the road, the most difficult one was the fact I was coming home. Not because it represents an end to all fun and freedom, not because I’m leaving the Latin America I fell in love with. It’s a weird and unsettling sensation. It looks like nothing’s changed, but it feels like everything’s changed.On the road I discovered and rediscovered different parts of myself. But once I came home, the same process started all over again…Roaming across the world with $10/d. Blogger, thinker, life enthusiast.

First and foremost, avoid being that person with the wheelie, bulky and impractical suitcase.With a backpack, you’ll be the first one out of the airport, quickest to get on the local metro and first one into the hostel.When packing, look at what you have and pack half of it.A real traveller will only have the essentials.Hours and hours of old school games to be enjoyed. No internet, no TV, maybe no electricity? Cards are always there for you.A great way to pass the day, alone, with your friends or new travel buddies.A few of my personal favourites: No heavy guidebook needed. No point lugging the books hundreds of kilometres around with you.The genius alternative… Save all the useful webpages you find when you have an internet connection. You will then have access to all these articles and their up to date tips A phone is a heck of a lot lighter than a book and gives you the chance to follow the advice of fellow travellers and to explore new places discovered through your own research.Leave the hair gel, the overnight skin cream, general bathroom cupboard crap at home.Instead pack the important stuff: hand sanitizer, ear plugs, Travelling is an adventure, and you never know where you might end up sleeping.Star gazing on a mountain, listening to the waves on the beach or, slightly less exotic, at the airport.Pack a travel sleeping bag for a comfy night sleep.There’ll be many a moment waiting for a connecting flight, 12 hour bus journey or chill out at the beach, these moment don’t seem right without a good book.Travelling with a In case you don’t have a Kindle, If you fancy something a little more personal, take an actual Even if you are going to the equator or somewhere hot, no travellers backpack is complete without a hoodie.So handy, you never know when you might need it.It’s like a mini safety blanket, cosy and reminds you of home.Useful for noting down great new restaurants, cool streets, local vocabulary, travel hangman, your new fellow travellers contact details (not everyone is on Facebook!)… so small but so many uses.Bottle opener for an icy cold beer you buy in a local store.

It’s been an interesting experience letting people know that I’m dipping out for two months. Most people get this bug-eyed look of shock that’s quickly tailed by an under-the-breath “Oh my god, I hate you…” Well, that sucks, but luckily I’m confident that at least 85% of those exclamations of hate were joking (meaning 15% were real, which is the exact ratio I want making up the company I keep). This was surely a big decision, but not as big as you might think. In fact, it’s very much achievable. I’d like to share how I’m making this happen, including costs along the way, my intended route, type of accommodation, and what I’m bringing.The trip begins in my 2nd favorite city, Paris. I’ll stay in When that ends in early October, I’ll spend a couple days The most popular question I’ve received so far is how the hell I’m fitting my life into one I always start by making a list. After I pull those items from my closet, I wash everything. Then I roll everything up and shove it in my pack. Done, right? NO. Then I take everything out, and pare it down. Take stuff out. Pack the bag. Do it again, empty that sucker. Take a few more things out.Also, roll everything. Do not fold. Roll your pants, shirts, dresses, etc. into little clothing burritos and then stack, stack, stack. It’s also best to group things together for easier access and pack navigation later on.Makeup bag, meds, face washies, Laptop/iPhone/Mophie + chargers, 3 BooksAnd that’s about it! In fact, this still might be overkill. But I like having options and it’s still only about a 40 lbs. pack so for me, this is worth it.I’ve always enjoyed my bread sans butter — not realizing it was the secret to a rich  flavorful life.

Until a day before the journey, I thought it was a loony idea to leave your phone behind and vanish from your routine for more than a day. What if I miss a big interview? What if I need to send a document immediately? What if somebody tries to reach me on an emergency? I wondered.The day after, when I reached Dindigul, tugging the phone in one hand and a luggage in another, a sneer my cousin often attempted crossed my mind. “Are you in charge of the switch to launch the rocket?”That moment, I switched off my smartphone, tucked it into my backpack and quietly told myself; At 8 A.M. that morning, resting my head on the car’s window sill, I drank in the view of the town that swept past my eyes. The town reminded me of Malgudi. I wondered if I would find a Sampath the Printer or a Raman the Painter, the talkative man or Selvi the musician. I looked at the children in school uniforms and wondered which one had a glint of mischief that Swamy carried in his stories. My eyes searched for houses with a “Why don’t we stop at Meenakshi Bhavan for breakfast?” suggested Pazhani, our driver.As we entered, a tall, bulky man, clad in a white “He is the owner. You see, this is a small town and everybody knows everybody else,” whispered Pazhani to me.I nodded, my eyes scanning the elaborate paper menu.“I’ll have In an hour, we were back on the road (Kodai Road), making our way into the mountainous terrains of Kodaikanal.Then, like we drove through an invisible bubble, the scene turned into a paradise. Like a painting on a sheet of canvas, the road ahead of us stretched into an infinity, thronged by an army of soaring pine and eucalyptus trees on either side. The pollution and dust gave way to an almost surreal breeze of piercing, cold air. If you closed your eyes and leaned out just a little, you could smell the soil, the grass and the fragrance from the swarm of trees surrounding you. As the road swayed left and right and rose at hairpin bends, I sang;Along the way up, we made several stops. First, to have dollops of juicy By that afternoon, we reached our destination: Mount Pleasant on Observatory Road. This was our home stay for the next two nights. Set between a top slide and bottom slide of lush green mountainous land, the place with its vast open space, French windows, marble flooring, a bookshelf and a telescope facing the terrains, set the pace for a relaxed weekend. Taking out a copy of Khaled Hosseini’s The Kite Runner, I sat at the steps outside the house, lost in the story for the next few hours.It was season time at Kodai, which meant, the place would be swarmed with tourists and loud music owing to the summer festival. So, I spent the next three days leaving aside the tourist spots and exploring the unexplored.I did what I would hardly think of doing back home. Every day, a seven kilometre walk downhill to the Bryant Park and a 13 kilometre cycling expedition around the lake. Every morning, I would lose myself in the swarm of tourists and Tibetian shops on one side and a soothing, thinly populated stretch of road on the other, where the only noise would come from the creaking of my pedal. Then, I would go exploring into the backwoods near the home stay, climbing trees, jumping rocks, and making my way up to the nearest ray of light. When I did, I’d feel like a child waiting to be applauded.This was worth the effort, for it built an appetite for warm homemade None of these were fancy restaurants. The hotels were set on the first floor of a dilapidated building and the parlour was located in an unnoticeable corner of a crowded shopping centre. But, what made them worth a memory (apart from the food being delicious, of course) was the subtle ambience and air of freedom that the place offered. With Moby, Billy Joel or Mohammad Rafi crooning on the recorder, the people lounged around for hours, reading a book, strumming a guitar or just watching the Chef slide a plate of raw dough into the wood fire oven.Here’s a confession. We did end up visiting a tourist spot — The Coaker’s Walk, a 30-minute walk along a trail of road with a view of Kodai from high above. The locals say was that if there is no mist, you can spot Madurai and probably even the Vaigai dam.Did we? No. But the vastness of the view was such that for long, I leaned against the railing and drank in the greenery that lay ahead of me. I felt small. I felt insignificant. I let my mind wander into the meaning of our existence. I wondered what we fight every day for. I hardly remember how much time passed by. But, I do remember this. As I walked out of the gate, I felt a sense of innocent happiness from within. I was humbled. The rest of the day, I remained quiet.In no time, the journey came to an end. As we drove back down the terrain, I remembered my phone for the first time in three days. But, until I was back home, it remained tucked between a pile of clothes…I prefer to look at life through rose tinted glasses.

I have always thought what Goa is to India, Fort Kochi is to Kerala. It is one of the most visited destinations in the state. Tourists from all over the world flock its timeless streets. Each of them amazed at the mosaic of cultures that make the port town what it is.My relationship with Kochi isn’t that of an awestruck tourist, but it might as well be. I have been visiting Kochi ever since I can remember. Fortunate enough to have an ancestral home here, I return back every year. And not once does its collective charm fail to impress me.Hundreds of years ago, the Dutch and Portuguese came to this town and capitalized on the flourishing spice trade. So to say Kochi feels like it could be anywhere in the world thanks to its multicultural look, is not a stretch of words. And that is exactly why you should head there, if you haven’t already.Kochi is probably most famous for being the burial town of Vasco Da Gama, but as someone who has had the luxury of time to explore the nooks and crannies of this place, I’d like to speak about the lesser known wonders it has to offer.A striking feature of Fort Kochi is its architecture. Portuguese houses that dot the streets date back to a few hundred years. Characteristic features of them are the tiled roofs, wooden ceilings and wooden floors. Like any amalgamation of cultures, these houses incorporate a significant amount of Kerala architectural traits too.Only here will you have the privilege of cruising around in a Rolls Royce for an hour for under a dollar. Don’t believe me? Look closer at the photo above.If you ever venture to Fort Kochi, you can be rest assured that finding a place to stay is a walk in the park. Many heritage houses have been converted to home stays. They render an old world charm which tourists love. It’s a part of the collective Fort Kochi experience. My favourite of all these home stays has to be the Koder house though.The Koder house is a boutique hotel. Not long ago it belonged to Satu and Gladys Koder, an illustrious Jewish couple from Iraq. Friday nights at the Koder house hold was called the Open House. Ambassadors from various parts of the world, celebrities and politicians were frequent guests at this event, which was one of the most looked forward evenings is Fort Kochi.Having visited Aunty Gladys as a child, I distinctly remember the scale of grandeur in this house. Wooden floors with a luster that could bear a reflection, chess checkered tiles and beautiful French bay windows made of Belgian glass, all made it seem like it was a part of a Disney fairytale. Butlers paced around the house quietly adding to the surreal experience that was an evening at Koder house.Jew town in Mattancherry has one of the oldest synagogues in the country. A few roads away from Fort Kochi, Mattancherry is a must visit for any traveler addicted to the rich history of colonial India.Kochi has a very strong cafe culture. The streets are spotted with colorful little food establishments that serve the tastiest of chocolate cakes, waffles, omelettes and iced teas. Every corner of each street is bound to be decorated with a quaint café that most often than not doubles as an art gallery.Book stores are not an uncommon site either. To any lover of peaceful cafes, a good book and rainy weather, Kochi serves as the ideal location. Also it throws in the added advantage of having a beach around the bend.If I have to be honest, the one aspect of Kochi that may have lost its charm is the beach. The encroaching waters have engulfed the sand. So the luxury of sitting by the waves has sunken away with the missing shore. However, if you are a seafood junkie then maybe you will be comforted by all the fresh catch of the day. Right next to most stalls are tiny shacks that cook your buy for you. Delicious to put it modestly!Some nights I like to go to a sea facing hotel, sit on the sides and stare at the passing ships at the dock. If you are lucky, you even see a dolphin or two bound up and slink back into the waters.Due to the many canals in and around Kochi, it’s often referred to as the Venice of The East. A short drive away from Kochi can take you to Alleppey where houseboats can be rented for a few hours. Popular sites on such a journey through the backwaters are -elephants getting bathed by their mahouts and local Toddy bars.I can never get enough of Kochi. The salty smell of the sea, the beauty of the heritage buildings that the locals are so oblivious to, the bells of the Basilica that ring every day and the diversity of people than stroll the streets, all of which and whom are stuck in time. It’s the best break you can get, from anything.Discover. Connect. DoActivities, Interests, People Passions and Possibilities.

Stuck in a job that you half-like and eager to see the world? It’s a huge misconception that you need a high-paying, 9–5 job at a massive corporation to fund your travel dreams.Those of us who have lived on the road for a few months are here to tell you that it’s not as hard as it looks.We’ve met people who have worked in mines in Australia, driven tractors in Thailand, and worked as nannies in Croatia. While those jobs aren’t for everyone, luckily for you, our friends at I’m sure you’ve heard about your friend’s-cousin’s-sister who taught English abroad. Teaching jobs can range from formal, salaried appointments at American, British or International schools to showing up in a country and offering your services as a tutor via Craigslist or similar. In many cases you can find jobs where you’ll receive free housing and get paid a stipend for your living expenses. And in places like South Korea, English teachers are in high demand. While teaching you’ll also get to meet other fellow travelers and make lifelong friends in your new city. Check out This is easily one of the best ways to meet people while traveling, PLUS you get free accommodation. What’s better than free housing? Because of the high turnover of hostel employees, these jobs aren’t too difficult to get either. At a popular hostel bar in La Paz, I spoke with an 18-year-old Brit who had never bar-tended a day in his life while he frantically mixed drinks on a busy Friday night. He mentioned he had gotten drunk the night before at this very bar, and was offered a job at this hostel on the spot. The moral of the story is, if you want to work abroad in a hostel, better drink up!What better way to see the world than by sailing the seven seas! Cruise liners need all sorts of If you’re fluent in a foreign language, see the world through the eyes of a tour guide. You basically get paid to go on awesome trips.

Websites like Imagine getting paid to write about your crazy globetrotting adventures. Sounds pretty good, huh? While definitely not easy to make money from, travelers from all over the world have made a living writing about their adventures, which in turn allows them to travel to even more places to write about.

My passion for travel and hunger to learn from people and places have begun when I made a life-changing decision of moving from Istanbul to London 8 years ago. This was when I stepped out of my comfort zone, started travelling to different places, and was exposed to a variety of cultures, which empowered me to constantly take on new challenges. Having had the chance to meet many influential people over the past years who has a significant role in who I am and where I am today, my life has taken a decidedly new angle over the past few months as alongside my agency work, I have also begun to work with startups. Those projects have given me a fresh approach and broadened my mind to realize that in today’s ever-changing business environment, startups need to compete with the world. Thinking about work in this 24/7 digital age and its impact on my personal and professional life, I came to realize that I needed to consider myself as a citizen of the world, and get on a journey as soon as possible to find where opportunity is the strongest. I wanted to rethink our agency’s approach to creative and talent, and connect different worlds to deliver faster and innovative solutions.That was when I came across an exciting project called I’m looking forward to see how much the world has to offer to me, both personally and professionally. I’m also looking forward to find out about the local markets for our startup partners Being aware of the saying that home is where the heart is, I’m now packing to go on this journey to create new homes and to leave pieces of my heart in multiple places. I want to thank to everyone who has supported me along the way to make my second big life-changing decision. Please follow me as I will be telling my stories and keeping you posted on SILA NUR ISIK

For #digitalnomads and new explorers alike, here are three ways travel can help you enhance your personal brand.Whether you meet them on a train or in a dive bar, there’s a good chance that the people you meet while traveling will have interesting stories. Listen to and digest these stories. Hearing the adventures, and misadventures, of others can inspire and invite you to reflect on what’s important to you and how you want to tell your own story. Traveling is also a great opportunity to try to tell your story in a new or different way when you meet people.Traveling isn’t all fun and games. Maybe you’ll get lost in the back streets of Tokyo or lose your passport while you’re on the other side of the world. These experiences can be especially difficult when you don’t have the comfort of a friend by your side, or even a place to go home to. It is moments like these that help define who you are and build resilience. How you tackle them and what you learn from them formulate the story that you’ll tell for the rest of your life.Traveling on your own can be an amazing experience as you’ll learn how to be alone, but not lonely. Whether you’re visiting a museum, journaling or riding on a train staring out of the window at unfamiliar landscapes, this “alone time” can help you look back on all that you’ve done and what you want to do. Make it a point to journal every day during your travels. Those thoughts will play a major role when you start writing your own story.Social Media for 

Están equivocados aquellos que piensan que invertir en viajes es un lujo reservado sólo para quiénes perciben salarios considerablemente mayores del promedio per cápita. Es una cuestión de planificación y de priorizar intereses.Lógicamente, esa planificación requiere disciplina y paciencia, pero ante todo, la convicción de que viajar no es un gasto efímero que termina cuando finaliza el itinerario. Muy por el contrario, es invertir en experiencias, es enriquecer la mente y el alma a través del descubrimiento de nuevas perspectivas del mundo que siempre habitamos pero que nunca deja de sorprendernos.Por tanto, si uno define como meta, ir conociendo progresivamente nuevos lugares, debe comenzar a destinar una parte de lo percibido, por más ínfimo que sea, a este nuevo propósito. Y no hace falta ser demasiado pretencioso, porque más cerca de lo que creés puede haber un destino interesante, inclusive dentro de tu propio país.Pero a pesar de esa reflexión, seguro estarás pensando, amigo lector, «hasta ahora no entiendo por qué esa expresión ‘light traveler’, ñembo cool gua’u, japoína»Ser un light traveler, es ser un viajero que le gusta ir liviano, suelto. En una analogía sencilla y muy personal, cargar un equipaje aparatoso representa quedarse, impedir la fluidez de la experiencia, es atarse a la realidad de la que uno idealmente pretende escaparse. Yo disfruto sabiendo que mi carga no será un impedimento, que llevo todo conmigo y que no hay manera que pueda ir dejando cosas por el camino (lo que es muy común que suceda, a juzgar por mi decadente capacidad de acordarme de cuidar lo que llevo).Sin embargo, el concepto no se reduce sólo al equipaje, sino a todo aquello que forma parte de la vivencia, que nada obstaculice, que nada interfiera esa fluidez de la experiencia.Así como hoy vivimos en la era de la información y ya no existen excusas para no estar informado de lo que pasa alrededor, de la misma manera, resultan escasas las justificaciones para no conocer esos lugares de los que tanto escuchaste hablar y en los que tanto tiempo invertiste, imaginando cómo sería ver París desde la punta de la Torre Eifel o dejarte invadir por la magia milenaria que envuelve al Machu Pichu.De valde vamos a hablar de las ventajas y facilidades que brindan herramientas online de compra de tickets aéreos, porque honestamente ya está obsoleta la discusión acerca de su efectividad y conveniencia. Aunque sí me gustaría abordar el tema de los hospedajes, ese tema que segrega parejas e instala las primeras divisiones en grupos de viaje.Si necesitás un departamento completo, o solamente una habitación para dos a un precio razonable, Airbnb es la mejor opción para encontrar estos lugares que plasman fielmente la personalidad del anfitrión que te recibe. De hecho, existe una interrelación con la persona que te hospeda, tras la bienvenida, hubo veces en las que me quedé conversando con ella, con lo cual, muchas veces se establece inclusive una amistad.*Se hace amigo y la vez siguiente ya pechea para que no le cobre*Pero si tu palo es viajar más desprendido todavía, CouchSurfing te va a gustar, aunque tené en cuenta que es algo más ‘chauloquista’, como diría un célebre amigo mío. Si bien podés elegir donde quedarte, el hecho que sea gratuito (no hay costo en la mayoría de los hospedajes porque se busca construir una red colaborativa de viajeros) hace que no exista de parte del anfitrión una responsabilidad de brindarte las condiciones básicas. ‘No money, no duties’, es el tema ahí. CouchSurfing es recíproco, funciona en base a recomendaciones de los demás, por lo que vos también eventualmente deberías estar dispuesto a recibir, ‘dar para recibir’, he’i la perrada. Si estás dispuesto, recomendadísimo.Ojo, el light traveler no sacrifica la comodidad ni la limpieza en el afán idealista de viajar liviano. Se trata de buscar alternativas convenientes, porque en la planificación de una escapada, se encuentran miles de opciones que se adaptan a todo tipo de necesidad. Aquí algunos ejemplos de los lugares de Airbnb en los que paré a precios muy accesibles en Barcelona (Consel del Cent, l’Eixample) y París (Place Maréchal Juin, Ilhe de France).Si querés aprovechar tu estadía para comer rico, andá a lo seguro, hay varias aplicaciones que recomiendan dónde comer, pero yo siempre uso Trip Advisor, que maneja un ránking interesante de sugerencias en varias partes del mundo y casi nunca fallan. Sirve muy bien también para buscar actividades interesantes. Más adelante en #LightTraveler13 vamos a compartir datos sobre platos recomendados de diversos destinos.En definitiva, ser un Light Traveler no es una fascinación circunstancial tipo los crossfiters que se enceguecen y fanatizan por lo que hacen, es todo lo contrario, es tomarse el viaje con calma, disfrutando cada minuto la vivencia de estar en un lugar distinto.(No tengo nada contra el crossfit, pero ovaléma tanto fanatismo hacia la actividad).I travel light, I am a constant nomad | Traveler | Journalist | Sharing traveling experiences through photos and stories |

There is an old Hungarian story that goes something like this.At one point during the Turkish invasions of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a number of Hungarian fighters were besieged in a small town and fought off the entire Ottoman army. One Hungarian noble in particular distinguished himself, defeating dozens of Turkish soldiers in hand to hand combat.A few years later this Hungarian was forced to move abroad. He applied for a job at a fencing school. In the end, there were two final candidates: The first, our Hungarian friend, who had proven his skills in combat. The second, a Frenchman, who had degrees in fencing and swordplay from prestigious institutions. The Frenchman got the job.The Hungarian didn’t give up. Soon, the fencing school held an open competition, a fencing tournament. He entered, and he fought his way through duel after duel after duel, and he faced the Frenchman in the final. And the Hungarian emerged triumphant over the Frenchman with his fancy degrees.I think this is mostly a story about how the Hungarians could take the French, if it came down to it. But it also gives me a lot of comfort being up here right now, because I think it says you don’t necessarily need the credentials, to have learned something in a book. You just need to have lived life, to have fought battles large and small. I’ve fought battles — with doubt, with faith, with belief, with the idea that God loves me unconditionally, with the idea that God would give up the sweetest gig in the world to wander around the desert with a bunch of undoubtedly very smelly men.Today’s scripture reading is one of a series of Psalms called “A song of Ascents.” They are believed to be travel songs. During pilgrimages to Jerusalem, people would stop at various stages and sing these songs. And that’s appropriate, because today I want to talk about travel, and specifically what I learned about God, and faith, while living and traveling abroad for the last two years.First, another story. A couple weeks after arriving in Hungary, I am feeling completely overwhelmed. New country, new culture, new language, new people. I’m in the grocery store, checking out, and this guy gets in line behind me. He’s about my age, in his 20’s. Hungarian. And he is buying the following items, and only the following items: Beer. Toilet paper. And ramen noodles.And I thought: I’m home.You could go to any country in the world, I think, and find a single, twenty-something guy buying the only three things you need, the only three things that are essential to life on this planet: Beer, toilet paper, and ramen noodles. It was this amazing moment, because I looked at him and I didn’t see Hungarian, American, language, culture, I just saw a human being that I totally understood. I looked at this guy, and I saw myself looking back. And I wondered, if this wasn’t what I was supposed to be doing as a Christian all along. Maybe a Christian is someone who is supposed to be able to look at a stranger and see themselves.I’ll go one step further. I think anyone is capable of looking at a stranger and seeing themselves. And just because you are a Christian doesn’t mean it happens automatically. Being a Christian, living as a Christian, is about choosing to look at a stranger, even an enemy, and see the face of Christ.When you travel, you have a choice. You can spend all of your time thinking about how strange, or weird, or alien everything is. I have traveled with people who spend the entire time pointing out how… different… things are, and not in a good way. The roads are different. The food is different. People are different. You have to pay to use the bathroom. I met a guy who joined the foreign service and spent the whole time trying to keep his kids away from foreigners. I heard a story about a guy who moved to India and shipped a year’s supply of hamburgers and hot dogs with him so he wouldn’t have to experience the local culture or cuisine.You can choose to do that. You can choose that life of comfort. Or you can choose to embrace the chaos. You can choose to see the humanity in people. You can see not a stranger who is different, not a foreigner, but see the global body of Christ. That is the choice.At its heart, Christianity is a religion of choosing. God offers His grace to all, but you need to open your hands. Christ is there, but you need to reach out. You can choose to live in comfort. Or you can pick up your Cross and follow Jesus. You can ask yourself, “from where will my help come?” And you can choose to answer, “My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.”I don’t think that’s easy. It is a lot easier to just build up our own egos, focus on things that are different because it makes us feel normal. Making a thousand tiny judgements each day makes us feel like we are in control, like we understand the world, we understand what’s going on. But that’s the second thing I learned traveling around — the impossibility of understanding everything, the impossibility of being always in control.When you google “Rosetta Stone Hungarian,” to try and buy the language software, what you find is not Rosetta Stone Hungarian — because only like two people want to learn this language. What you find instead is the satirical newspaper, The Onion, with the headline, “First Disk Of Rosetta Stone Hungarian Just Urges Listeners To Rethink This Whole Thing.” And it’s true. It’s an impossible language.The entire time I was there I did not have a clue what was going on. A year and a half and I only barely picked up survival Hungarian. If you told me before I went, “you’re not going to know what’s happening most of the time,” I would have been terrified — I Nothing was more horrifying than the idea that I might be not be able to understand, or be aware. Because if I don’t understand, if I’m not aware, then I’m not in control. And if I’m not in control than anything could happen, and it probably would be bad, and I didn’t want to have to live with that fear all the time.At some point I realized that this is often how we approach God. We want to understand God. We want Him to make sense. We want God to fit in a nice comprehensible box with a neat tidy bow around it. We want a perfect theology that all interconnects and and intersects and makes sense, not because God wills it, but because we want it. We want to understand God so we can be in charge.Because the alternative is, he could do anything with our lives, and that’s a scary thought. If we don’t understand him or can’t put him in a box, then maybe our other choice is to abandon faith altogether. But I think there’s a third path.When I was living overseas and someone asked me a question that I didn’t understand, I would give them a series of answers to potential questions they might be asking. So if I’m trying to buy train tickets, I respond: One ticket. Today. One-way. America. Credit card. The cheapest one you’ve got, please. Eighty percent of the time, that works. It’s brute force, but it works.Isn’t that just how it feels to be a Christian? We spend all our time trying to answer God’s questions, without ever really knowing what he’s asking of us. We pray. We worship. We serve the poor. We love our neighbor — sometimes. And we just hope that’s what God is really asking of us in the first place, and not some other thing. Like maybe God wants us to watch Netflix all the day long.Doubt and uncertainty are as integral to being a Christian as they are to living abroad. Because being a Christian is akin to being called out of the world we understand, the dog eat dog world that has powerful and not-powerful, rich and poor, and being called into a really strange place with completely different rules that just looks the same.You would never expect to land in a new country, and know everything about it, and act as if you grew up there. You could never fit in perfectly. And yet somehow we expect that of ourselves in God’s Kingdom. But I think we will never actually understand what it’s like to live in God’s Kingdom. We can live there for awhile, we can invite people in, we can tell people how great it is, but we are never going to truly understand it, and that’s ok.And even if we do travel there, our trip is going to end. And that’s the third thing that comes to mind. Every vacation ends. Your travels are done. It’s time to go home. Back to your troubles. Back to the mundane. Back to Mondays. Grocery shopping. Annoying coworkers. And that can be the worst feeling in the world. It can feel like death. That awesome “vacation you,” that awesome explorer, is dying, and being replaced by the old boring “9-to-5 you” who is annoyed all the time.I always get in a fight a day before vacation is over. It is as if I’m experiencing the grief of the end of the vacation before it arrives, so I’m cranky and in a foul mood. And worse than that, a lot of times I would travel places and a museum I really wanted to see would be closed, or I just didn’t have time to make it out to see an amazing church. I would start beating myself up, saying this whole trip was not worth it, this whole trip was a waste. I was grieving over experiences I didn’t get to live. I spent the first few months in Budapest panicking about seeing everything there before our time there was up, and I was miserable and horrible because of it.I think the reason all these things hurt so much is that there is nothing more offensive to the human experience than the reality of impermanence. In God’s Kingdom, the sun rises, and the sun sets. Summer becomes fall and then turns to winter. But we don’t want that. We want the good things to stay and never leave. We want the good things to last forever, and we don’t like goodbyes, and every little goodbye feels like death. But it turns out, there is life after death.I have come to believe that we have too small an understanding of Christ’s resurrection. Yes, He is risen, and in him we have eternal life. Yes, in dying and rising from the dead he triumphed over sin, he became King, he launched the process of renewing the world, he united for a moment Heaven and Earth in a single point that everything can stem from.But he also showed that there is life after not just physical death… but life, after all those terrible, little daily goodbyes that feel like death.The end of your trip feels like death. Not being able to see that must-see sight, feels like death. The end of the summer. The end of a relationship. The loss of a job. Something as small as feeling dumb, if you make your ego your source of life, can feel like death. We make people, or experiences, or things, or status, into idols, essentially. Because we believe we cannot live without them — and if you can’t live without something, then isn’t it an idol?What if, instead, we really and truly believe that “The Lord will keep you from all evil; he will keep your life”? What if when Jesus came back, he didn’t offer just physical resurrection, but spiritual renewal? What if after you say goodbye, after you feel wronged, when you’re at your lowest point, when you feel so small, you are dying inside… what if at that moment, there is new life, because Jesus came back?I wonder how much different my time in Budapest would have been if I had focused on enjoying each moment, instead of being stressed about the moments I may never have a chance to enjoy. I wish I had trusted that that in this strange, foreign land of God’s Kingdom, resurrection is a fact of life — that joy does cometh in the morning.Because joy is real, because resurrection is real, we can let our need for mastery, for control, slip away, let it die. We can accept that we have to say goodbye, sometimes, even that we have to say goodbye to our own ego or our own comfort — because we had to say goodbye to Jesus once already and he came back for us.There are bus schedules in Russian that simply make no sense, but if you leave early enough you will still get to the airport. If your flight is canceled at 4 in the morning, you will find a new one. When you are locked out of your one-room cabin in the middle of the desert in a country where you don’t speak the language, with no shoes, no wallet, no phone, no keys — you can choose to believe that God knows what he’s doing, you can choose to believe that you’re going to be ok. And then, if you’re me, you can choose to commit felony breaking and entering to get back in.We can choose, each day, to experience the new or different or annoying as a blessing, whether or not it is, because God gave us the gift of choosing.We can choose to belief in new life, instead of grieving over death. We can look at someone who is richer than us, or poorer than us, has a different skin color, who acts differently, thinks differently, loves differently, and we can choose to see ourselves in that person, we can choose to see God staring back at us. We can see someone from a different country and see ourselves. We can sit in the courtyard of the Blue Mosque in Istanbul and listen to the call to prayer and not feel like someone else’s faith means the death of our own, but instead just simply look at the sunset flickering across ancient stone.The Trinity makes about as much sense to me as a love poem in Hungarian, but I can tell it’s about love. The mystery of the Cross is as incomprehensible as a menu in Estonian, but you will be nourished. You will be fed. A few weeks ago I stood in the driest desert in the world and saw rocks bigger than this church, in the midst of nothingness of sand. And I knew that God was in the rock, and in the sand, and in each of the six billion people on the planet, and yet somehow, also, larger than the billions of stars you could see in the night sky.You can try to make sense of it. You can try to understand it. You can exhaust yourself unlocking it. Or you can just glory in it. You can experience it. You can sit with the mystery of Almighty God.Christianity, again, is a religion of choosing. The biggest choice is to have faith when faith makes no logical sense.It’s not like learning to sword fight in school and getting a degree. It’s a lot more like being the Hungarian swordsman. We learn our faith by doing, by going forth into the world, by fighting battles.We can do it all knowing that that “The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in from this time on, and for evermore.” He will carry us when our legs are too tired, he will love us when we hurt, he rescues us when our flight is canceled or we lock ourselves out of our hotel rooms. And even when He makes no sense, when it seems like pure chaos, we can choose love in the darkness, we can believe that love is everlasting life, and know it always has been.Freelance troublemaker

So we already know that When people hear about So, you have sized yourself up and decided that long term travel is actually something you want. The next step is turning it from a lofty dream to a hard-set reality. You need to Long term travel is much less expensive than you would think, but you still are going to need some savings to make it through. Travel is usually priced by daily budget. In my experience, there are a couple different ‘tiers’ of budgets.$15/day or less is really scrapping it. This is possible, but you are going to need to have free accommodation most or all of the time, cook for yourself with limited cheap ingredients every night, and not be doing things like paying to enter UNSECO world heritage sites because that’s more than your entire budget for the day. If faced with a choice between a 24 hour bus ride through the mountains vs a 1 hour plane flight for twice the price, you’ll need to take the former, every time. Hitchhiking will also be a primary mode of transit. From having spoken to people who are on this budget, it is uncomfortable for sure, and you will end up sacrificing experiences, time, and potentially healthy, but it is possible. This could be made much more comfortable always doing work exchanges, or by biking and camping. This requires $30/day is decent. You will be able to pay for accommodation sometimes, but will need to aggressively seek out free accommodation most of the time. You might be able to go out for food occasionally, but you will be cooking for yourself most of the time. To stay in this budget range, you’ll want to have a heavy portion of your food and lodging costs covered by work exchanges. You’ll be able to afford transit, but swing much harder towards cheap busses, car shares, and ultra budget flights booked months ahead. In my opinion, this is as thrifty as you can get without giving up health or basic comforts. This requires $50/day gives you a bit more of a comfortable buffer. At this rate, you don’t need quite as much free housing, and you can afford to eat out sometimes, if you want. You will also be able to afford small luxuries like entering famous tourist sites that charge for admission, or taking a boat tour of an island. You still will not be staying in hotels or shopping for sure, and will be aiming to reduce costs as much as possible, because you never know when a country or flight will be more expensive than you thought (*cough London*). This is around our budget, to be transparent, and we feel quite comfortable in this range, and not frequently limited by money. This requires Anything over $50/day is pushing into probably more than you need, but if you can afford this go for it. At this range you can spend the whole trip without getting free accommodation, but if you do have some mixed in, which you should, you can book nicer places when you are not staying somewhere free. You can go out to eat most of the time if you want to. You can afford to be more lax in your transit booking and make a couple mistakes that cost more. You will be able to enter paid tourist sites without issue. You won’t feel like you need to be as aggressive in cutting your costs at every opportunity. This requires Now, how do you save up these chunks of money? You can save a lot by aggressively cutting out luxuries from your life, and putting them towards your travel fund. Cook for yourself at home, stop shopping for new things you don’t need, plan activities with friends that don’t revolve around expensive things, like having lunch at a park instead of a restaurant, and drinking and hanging out at your place, rather than a bar. If you have skills you can use to work remotely, this can help to ease costs significantly as well. I am fortunate to work in computer programming, and as such can work remotely to help subsidize our costs a bit. Currently I am working one day per week, and this for me is a good amount. If I were staying longer in places (like an average of two weeks per location), I would be comfortable working two days a week or more. Really, this is a balance you need to find for yourself through.And of course, make sure to First things first, That being said, you want to You want to give yourself time in the places you are staying, way more time than if you were taking a vacation. In our experience, three days or less is a pretty rough experience. We try to aim for at least 5 days in each place we stay, and about 2 weeks at work exchanges.Why so much more time than usual? A couple reasons. First, transit cuts days out. You need to get to the place and leave. You need to assume that Also, when traveling long term, you are not going out and seeing things full time. You also need time to work, plan the next portion of your trip, research the place you’re at, keep on top of your budget, and stay in touch with friends and family. This stuff takes much longer than you think, and at very least you should assume you’ll need one “personal day” per week, when you can get things done. It would be much more comfortable to have two though. So that’s minus at least one more day.Now you can see why three days in a place is too little. That can easily get whittled down to As for the actual planning, we mostly use In reality, unless you are actually a trust-fund baby looking for an extended vacation, the reality of travel is a severely restricted budget. Any non-rich human being is going to be facing a major downsize in lifestyle, becoming much more frugal than they ever imagined. I have met travelers who lived on less than $10 a day for months, trying every day to figure out a place they can stay for cheap or free, and dining on only ramen noodles and water.But as we know, life for most people is simply a So, how can you manage to spend so much less? A small, simple set of changes can drastically cut costs, while also making your healthier and giving you a much deeper integration into local culture.For accommodation, you can get this for free by staying with friends or family, Some of the time, you’ll end up paying for accommodation though. If this is the case, you’ll want to aim for hostels or For food, For transit, we use Now the last question — what are you doing day-to-day? We figured out before long that Earlier, I was talking about long term travel with someone from twitter (The answer to this is a resounding “absolutely not!” Travel will turn your views on life inside out. You will re-evaluate what you can live on, what makes you happy, and how you can really be fulfilled. When you get back, you will need to fight slipping back into the standard routine and work towards building a life that truly makes you happy. lifelong learnerAdventures in Learning, Life, and Happiness

As an American that’s regularly traveled to Japan over the past ten years — in trips ranging from 2 weeks to 7 months — I’ve accumulated a few observations and tips that have made getting around significantly easier.I travel with a carry-onable back pack. Anything larger would be obnoxious when negotiating trains/bus stations. Specifically, I travel with an If you ever need to ditch your bag before arriving at wherever you‘re staying, search any major train station for coin lockers large enough to cram it in (coin lockers are typically deceptively deep and spacious). Typically, you insert your bag first (to ensure it fits), then insert coins to engage the lock and release the key. Increasingly, coin lockers are going digital, able to break change or pay with Plan on carrying plenty of cash. Credit cards aren’t as ubiquitous in Japan as they are in most of the Western world, and smaller businesses often refuse them as a result. Chains and major retail outlets will almost always accept credit, however (Visa, MasterCard, and American Express are usually accepted in similar proportion to the US). I typically withdraw money every few days while I’m in the country and default to using cash and awkwardly slowing down transactions as I fumble to count coins.Once you’re in the country, the best place to use an ATM is, strangely enough, at If you’re in an area without a bevvy of 7–11 convenience stores, you can also use the ATM or exchange currency at a Japanese post office (you’ll stumble over them if you look for the 〒 symbol on signs or ask ”郵便局はどこですか？” (phoenetically: ‘you-bean-kyoku wa doko dess ka?’). ATMs at Japanese Post offices are always international.Traveling in Japan is almost eerily, worrisomely safe.Legally, however, if you’re traveling Japan as a tourist on a 90-day visa and don’t have a “If you’d like some horror stories to scare you into carrying your passport everywhere you go, you might check out We always purchase Passes cannot be purchased by Japanese nationals and they must be paid for Once you arrive in Japan, find the first Japan Rail (JR) office and ask to exchange the voucher for a rail pass there — they’ll direct you to a station or office that issues them. They’re not cheap ($300 or so per person for a 14 day ticket), but if you plan on riding any bullet trains (as you ought to if you’re going from Tokyo to Kyoto and Osaka and back), it’ll almost certainly pay for itself. Simply present it (displaying the expiration date outwardly) at any JR turnstile to an attendant and they’ll wave you through. It works for the bullet trains, but Note also that a Rail Pass won’t cover every train in the country, and it usually won’t cover bus fare. Most large cities’ subway infratructure isn’t operated by JR, so those fairs (usually $2–3 a ride) aren’t coveregd by the pass. Also, keep in mind that some trains must be reserved in advance (at no additional cost if you carry a Rail Pass), like the N’EX connector between Narita and Tokyo, which any ticket sales attendant can reserve for you if you show them your pass.If you don’t get a rail pass or if you’re riding a private rail line (or subway or bus), most ticket centers have at least one terminal that’ll have an english button somewhere on it. When you’re in Osaka/Kyoto, someone will probably offer to help you, because unlike in Tokyo, people are typically nice and gregarious.The procedure is usually something like:In urban centers and on subways, the platform you want is typically more important than the schedule, because trains run so frequently that most people will just wait for the whenever the next one comes.There are a few tricky parts to train schedules in JapanI’d recommend the As a last resort, just ask. Typically, if you ask an employee “I want to go to ___” and look confused enough, they’ll stay with you as long as necessary to help you out. LIkewise, if you’re on a train and need to know if the station you’re arriving at is your exit (or change), just point at the door and ask the name of your destination to literally anyone around you and they’ll probably understand your intent.Occassionally, commuter trains in Japan will announce the next stop is the end of the line (“終点 / shoe-ten”). If you witness every single human get off the train simultaneously, it’s typically a smart strategy to exit as well, and follow the mob to whatever train they board next.Japan’s renowned wireless network is very solid. Accesing it can be tricky, depending on your situation.If you carry a locked phone, it can’t hurt to call your carrier and request an unlock in advance of your travel. If you can’t avoid the fact that your phone is locked and you don’t want to pay extravagant data roaming charges, you could consider renting a mobile hotspot. One service that offers rental hot spots to tourists is If you do have an unlocked phone, I strongly recommend you drop by an electronics store and look for a data-only SIM. I documented this in a separate As for wifi, free public wifi is relatively rare in Japan. There are tons of hotspots in public spaces, but many of them tie back to residential ISP service and require authentication. There’s an interesting workaround to this, by way of an Similarly, many hotels are still not equipped with wifi, but Booking hotels in Japan in English is almost as easy as any Western country, and resellers like Booking can be looked up through just about any TripAdvisor review. Keep in mind, however, that a large proportion of Japanese hotels aren’t listed on any third-party booking sites. To get access to a few more listings, you might check out In large cities, getting an apartment to yourself via Airbnb can also be a good option. The real-estate market in Japan has been suffering a slow descent as the population has declined and inventory keeps outstripping demand, which means apartments are relatively cheap, and as a result even very nice luxury apartments on Airbnb are pretty affordable.If you find yourself in an urban area without a place to stay for an evening (or you accidentally stayed someplace after the trains shut down), you might be able to find some rest at an internet/manga cafe, which are often equipped with showers, lockers, and rooms with sofas. At a few bucks an hour, they can make for an extremely cheap hotel substitute in a pinchMaintaining a healthy disrespect for the status quo since first learning what status quo meant

Learned a few things when I was traveling oversees, thought it might be useful for others.If you have an american debit card then below tips would really help save money for getting local currency. Note that you get best conversion rate with ATM withdrawal and save you bunch (even if you pay for ATM fee). Don’t get the local currency from those airport currency exchanges, they are rip off.Many big cities in the world(For example, Rome) are notorious for pickpocketing etc. It’s best to plan for the scenario where you lose your Wallet, Passport, Credit cards, Cash and bags. Some tips:Buy pickpocket safe purses/bags. Save scans of important documents like Passport and Visas, Credit cards and so on. Save addresses and phone numbers of local consulates or other govt officials. Read local travel safety guidelines and US travel advisory for those places ahead of time.Hope above tips are useful to you. Building 

The year is winding down at the International Center of Photography; we’re all getting our framing designs finalized for the end of year student exhibition. But I want to share a little assignment I did for a magazine class last term. The task was to create a traditional travel story in none other than the scourge of any born-and-raised New Yorker, Times Square.It’s a sight I see nearly everday. I commute into the city from central Jersey, and so, after a not-so-pleasant hour-long train ride, I am always greeted to above ground New York with tourists wielding selfie-sticks and hop-on hop-off bus vouchers in my face. It’s going to be hard to make this place seem pleasant with such a strong personal bias. Yet, the more challenging task was really to take interesting photographs that defied the vernacular of Times Square, New York. Bright lights, crowded streets, night turned into day from the glow of advertisements. Disney characters, street performers, every family member with a large phony smile on their face for the camera.I hearkened back to a workshop I had with the venerable Jeff Jacobson and decided to take an approach I practiced extensively. To channel the rush and excitement one might feel in their first visit to Times Square, I used a long exposure to capture the motion of the city with exhilarating and electric colors. What resulted was a psychedelic whirlwind of energy and motion, a synesthetic tableau for the senses. Or at least, I hope.Dedicated blog of documentary photographer of…well, see name above.

A few days ago I arrived from a 10-day trip to the US. As the CEO and co-founder of a B2B technology startup with global ambitions, For this trip, I did If a When we make decisions about transportation and accommodation, we look for some things that match our most basic needs — and yes, Besides this, we also value For my 10-day trip, After that I went to Once again, I couldn’t care less about those questions when I arrived to the US. I just opened the same app I use in my hometown, While in NYC, I also had the chance to try Oh yeah, and I carried Here are some stats of my trip:How fast will companies be to embrace this new type of travelling?CEO  Co-Founder of 

For many of us in the startup world who don’t live near San Francisco, a deep connection to the talent, ideas, partners and investors in the area is not optional. It’s important to our success. But this area is an impractically expensive place to live, especially on a measly founder’s salary. The median two bedroom apartment rent is now $5,000 a month in SF:This may be reasonable for a Google product manager and a Facebook engineer who are married and making a combined $200k+ but for those of us keeping our personal and company burn rates as low as possible it’s almost impossible to imagine affording rent like this before our Series A.I’ve been traveling back and forth to Silicon Valley (SF  parts south) from my home in Durham, NC for over two years now. A friend and fellow startup CEO recently asked me for a few recommendations of what neighborhood to stay in. Then how to find a good place. Then how to get around. At the end of this conversation I realized that the various best practices I’ve developed would be very valuable to other founders, so this post is everything I use to make this trip monthly with a minimum of expense and hassle.If you’ve got your own tips to share, please don’t hesitate to drop a comment. I always love learning about new deals.To commute monthly to SF/SV you’ll need the following things:Let’s dive into my recipes for each of these, one by one.I get my cheap flights from either Hipmunk, which helps me find the right price-to-agony ratio, or Kayak, which offers awesome ‘Hacker fares’ that can combine one-way flights on two different airlines to save $50–100. All in, my flights cost $380–560 per, even booked the week before. So I know I can reliably get out to SF when needed, even on relatively short notice.One caveat on Hacker Fares: they’re often high-agony flights, meaning they’re at crappy times or have long layovers. I’ll do it if I have to but if I can avoid one 6 hour layover out and one horrible redeye back for ~$50 extra or less I’ll pony up. So I check Kayak for cheap and non-horrible flights but if there’s nothing I usually book Hipmunk’s cheapest low agony option.Airbnb has indelibly changed the way I travel for business. When I travel for work all I need is a quiet place to sleep, a shower, and good access to public transit (more on that below). I search Airbnb for listings under $50/night and usually have more than a few good options. Since I almost always spend some days doing meetings in SF and some days in points south (existing investors in Redwood City, prospective investors in Palo Alto, partners in Mountain View, etc), I find that Millbrae is often the perfect place to stay. I can reliably get a bed for $35–45 that’s about a 5 minute walk to Millbrae’s combo BART/Caltrain station. Plus, it’s right across the 101 from SFO, very convenient for those late night flights.If you’ll only be in SF I’d still recommend Millbrae unless you can find a bed for $50 or less. The ~$8 round trip commute isn’t bad at all (see also Reliable Internet below) and most beds in SF are $80+ and they can take just as long to get into downtown.If you’ll only be in the South Bay, Mountain View has lots of hacker houses with beds in the $45 range. YCombinator and 500 startups are both in MV so I think that’s why there are so many good options for founder types.Public Transit is your friend. The Bay has one of the best transit systems in the world (don’t listen to locals’ gripes), so make good use of it. The Bay’s transit is as follows:If you use Transit you’ll want a Clipper card. These rechargeable farecards will save you money and time. Your first ride you’ll need to buy a one-off ticket at one of the vending machines in a station. But once you’re in the city, buy a Clipper card from your nearest Walgreens or Whole Foods (there are other stores that sell them that you can Whenever you’re going anywhere, use Google Maps’ Transit mode to plan your route. It’ll calculate the best way to get there and automatically answer the question of when it’s best to transfer to BART, take a MUNI etc.Do not, I repeat, DO NOT use Apple Maps.Some Random Tips:Lyft and Uber are generally a bad idea for founders looking to save money. An Uber from SFO to Mountain View can be $100. No good.That said, if you’re in downtown SF, Lyft Line (the carpool option) will get you anywhere you need to go for $5 or less. They’ve also set up ‘hot spots’ where you’ll get the best price for this service, as low as $3 for a ride anywhere in downtown SF. You’ll see little flame icons on your map if you’re near one. If you are, go there before Lineing. They tend to be near BART and Caltrain stations, which is super convenient. In some situations Lyft Line is as cheap and much faster than MUNI. Just make sure to leave some extra time before meetings if you’re Line-ing. You’ll be carpooling so they may have to pick up or drop off.If you have a tight connection and need to, for instance, get from the Twitterloin (Market St near the civic center) to Galvanize (a coworking space in SOMA) in under 25 minutes like I did recently, splurge for a real Lyft. It’ll be $10–15 and you won’t keep your investor waiting.I don’t use Uber much because they’re more expensive and the company just reminds me of Darth Vader too much. They’re very quick and reliable though so nice to have in the rare must-be-on-time-and-why-is-Lyft-not-working situation. Just don’t go over to the dark side.New to Lyft? Use If you need a car, If you listened to me and stayed in the Millbrae hacker house you can also walk 10–15 minutes to the Aloft parking lot to pick up your car for only the day you need it instead of renting it for the whole trip.When would you want to rent a car? If you have a bunch of meetings in the ‘burbs (away from Caltrain and BART), it probably makes sense to rent a car. Sand Hill Road is expensive to Uber to and slow to bus to. I sometimes visit schools that use Trinket while in SF and they’re almost always very far away from Caltrain. In these situations I rent a car for an entire day for the price of a one-way Lyft ride. I also try and bundle all my car-needing meetings on the same day(s).I kinda already wrote everything I know about eating on the cheap in Looking for free food to go with your Soylent? Subscribe to Startup Digest for the SF Bay area and crash events for pizza. Tech meetup groups for programming languages and frameworks are an excellent source as well. I recently went to the Python and Meteor groups and both were delicious and great for networking with engineers.The internet is a human right or something, right? If you deny yourself a basic right you have no one but yourself to blame.Your Hackerhouse should have passable Wifi. But in the land of Comcast and the wilderness that is cafe Wifi you need to pack your own. There’s nothing like the sinking feeling of not being able to make that final tweak to a deck or send that critical file. Reliability is the name of the game.My solution is Verizon’s awesome LTE network. Now you may be willing and able to pay for the ability to tether to your phone. If so, good on ya. I have ATT so my Internet access is the one splurge in this list. I got an awesome Verizon Jetpack over two years ago and it’s been my trusty companion since. Get a model with huge battery life- mine lasts 15 hours on a charge- and good reviews. Mine was about $200 but you can probably get a better one for cheaper now (the But we’re talking about Internet, not how awesome Chromebooks are…BYOInternet will save your butt. I always fire up my modem and get a connection *before* an investor pitch. That way you can shake hands, pop open your laptop and go instead of durdling around with their guest Wifi passwords, etc for the first 5 precious minutes of their time when they’re forming first impressions. This setup lets me do video meetings and email on those smooth but otherwise unproductive Caltrain rides.Verizon’s data is pricey, $30/mo for 4gb plus $20/month per device. The good news is that if you already have data from them you can buy a modem and for $20/month you’ll have near flawless internet with you at all times, hooked into your existing data plan.I love cheap stuff, but only if it’s good. The reality is that Verizon’s network is the only Internet that’s reliable enough for my needs while traveling, so I splurge on it. Until anyone else catches up, I recommend you do the same.If you happen to go over your data plan they will text an alert to your modem and you can bump up your plan for the month to avoid overage fees.As a nice bonus, having good wifi with you will help at home too. I’ve used mine in cafes, meetings, airports and even to patch over office internet hiccups. My modem can take up to 10 devices so I’ve had the whole team on it when we’re waiting for outages to be fixed. I literally never leave for work without it.Here are my rough average costs for the items above for a 5 day/4night trip:If you can’t tell, I like to max/min things. I used to reason that the most expensive part of a trip was the flight so the way to minimize the per-day cost was to stay for as long as possible while out here. Now I only take 5 day trips, M-F. Why?The error in the min/max equation above is not equating it back to business value, which drops precipitously after that first week. Regularity is much more important that quantity when it comes to maintaining relationships. Now that I know I’ll reliably (and cheaply) be in SF once a month it’s easy to keep my relationships up. I can see people in person, schedule video chats if they can’t make it, or worst case see them next month. I see some of my contacts more regularly than they do their SF-based contacts.Trust me, part of me cringes at the cost of the flight. I wish they were cheaper: I’d buy them in bulk. If you live in DC they probably already are since there are many direct flights. But with all the other hacks in here if you’ve got $750 a month to spend on this you too can build a meaningful and regular presence in Silicon Valley.CEO 

In spite of owning a Since graduating college, I’ve always had this guilt. It feels like there are so many things I And I’m willing to bet plenty of other people deal with similar feelings despite the fact they say travel is a priority.— — — — — — —I got a phone call last month from a friend; an old college friend I hadn’t seen or spoken to for seven years. Let’s call him Jack.I loved Jack in college, and so did everyone else. He was brilliant, clever, stubborn in all the right ways, and always wore the epitome of a winning smile.“Cohen, you don’t know this, but I’m driving across the country to visit you,” Jack said when I answered his call.“Really? That’s great. When are you getting to L.A.?”“I’m actually in Pasadena right now. Is that close to where you live?”I told Jack that, indeed, it is. About fifteen minutes away. I told him to come over.Because I make my most of money freelancing in film production, any time I set aside to travel or work on my own projects costs me money. Most jobs come about last minute. I almost never know what I’m going to be doing work-wise a month ahead of time.So, I have to assume that any two week trip I take is going to cost me several thousand dollars. And I I’m also competitive, both with myself and others. Anytime I’m not working on my own projects or proving how great I am on other people’s jobs, I worry that someone is going to get a leg up on me.In spite of having saved up plenty of airline and hotel rewards points and having signed up for rewards credit cards with the goal of taking a specific trip to a new destination, I can’t bring myself to up and leave Los Angeles. Sure I’ve dabbled with short domestic trips. But I can’t let myself truly get away. At least not to go to another country, unplug, and spend some time with my own brain.Instead I’m here, being a good boy. Getting back to emails quickly. Adding more lines to my resume. Driving across town to get ten dollar coffees with acquaintances’ acquaintances.Jack showed up at my place in his dirty car filled with sundry belongings and bags. He had been traveling across the country for almost two months, meeting old friends here and there. He both had had benders and had thought deeply about the meaning of it all. He took in the open road. He thought about how he wanted to reshape his life into something he wanted it to be. It had been the kind of trip all young Americans were supposed to take once upon a time.We got lunch and caught up for hours. Told old mischievous stories. Talked politics, and religion, and books. The type of things you can only discuss with the best people. We both laughed a lot.Jack loved hearing about my life and kept asking detailed questions. I started a profitable company and work in the film business. The two minute version of it sounds sexy, especially when you’re blind to the nitty-gritty of it all. Jack told me he wanted to be his own boss and asked for a list of books to read to start his own company. He also said he’d come work on He told me how much he hated his old job at a big financial company. It was antithetical to everything he wanted out of life. He had stopped enjoying himself. He had stopped having new ideas.So he saved up money and cashed out his savings for this trip he was on.On Tell your friends you’ll be taking a trip at a specific time long in advance. Book the flight, even if it’s a bit more expensive than it would be later. Setup an automatic savings account and a goal in your personal finance software.Even if it’s a bit obvious and reductive, it’s good advice that’s helped people travel.But what’s behind the guilt in the first place? How can the pathology be cured?It sounded like what I needed.He’d visit Yosemite and sleep under the stars. Something I haven’t made time to do in eight years in California.Next, he’d maybe go to Canada or perhaps spend some time in the Pacific Northwest.It didn’t seem that answering emails was high on his priority list.On this trip, he was a free man.Are there reasons I shouldn’t feel so damn guilty for abandoning my duties?Admittedly, these are first-world problems. I’m aware some people are starving, children are born with horrible disorders, and countless others suffer truly horrendous maladies of fate on a daily basis. Some people can’t contemplate serious travel. I’m lucky not to have to deal with those things.But for those fortunate enough to be able to make travel happen, it provides some useful benefits aside from simple sightseeing.This year at Sundance in Park City, Utah, I had the idea for a new screenplay. The story came whole to me: beginning, middle, and end. I took some quick notes on my phone and called my friend to tell him the story to make sure I didn’t forget.I came back to L.A. and wrote the whole thing in a few weeks. The script has helped me meet new people in the industry and has been good for my career.For creative types, travel provides fodder for new stories and pieces of art.Businesspeople meet new people to work with, expanding their networks, and learn about new markets in which to do business.And oftentimes when I get back from a trip I’m recharged to work extra hard at my projects. Perhaps we shouldn’t feel so guilty about traveling because it helps us be more productive in the long run. As contrary as it seems, breaking our routine and visiting new places seems to give us a leg up in the rat race.It was the worst kind of call.He’s the first good friend I’ve lost.There’s nothing good I can say about Jack’s death. Luck can be horrible.But it gives me solace to know that at least Jack was on the open road, exploring the world when it happened. I’m so glad he didn’t meet his end cooped up at his corporate job that he hated, working on things meaningless to him.Aside from the purely instrumental and moneymaking, travel seems good for the soul. Forget the rat race. Maybe I shouldn’t feel guilty about travel because it’s a good thing in itself.I don’t want to have been the person who spent the most time at his computer answering emails promptly when that day comes.With the end of the trip in mind, traveling isn’t something to feel guilty about.photo credit: Film writer and director.

Given that I come from a defence background, it was hardly any surprise that I took to travelling, like a fish to water. I got my first taste of travel when I was quite young. But it wasn’t until a few years ago that I started travelling by myself. Since then, the list of places I have visited has grown and the desire to see more has become stronger.Travelling has been a story of personal enrichment. The changes within me were sometimes too subtle. And at others, were too damn dramatic. Few needed to be pointed out to me, while few were noticed only by me. But one thing I knew for sure: Travelling, especially travelling alone, has changed me. And for the better.It was a dearly-held belief. But something changed that warm summer evening when I met a gentleman from Pakistan in Bhote Koshi, Nepal. I learnt that a smile, a wave, and a friendly attitude can break down any barrier and create friendships, even between the two most unlikely people.Flights are not always on time. Local food might not always be palatable. Things do get lost or stolen while on the road. There are several such things that could go ‘wrong’. But somehow it always seems to work out! The more we travel the better we adapt to these situations. And find a way out where there’s none.I used to be a freak. I needed rigid itineraries, lists, plans… everything! And I needed them all written down like in the Babylonian times. But now, I am no longer a slave to my schedules. I might meet a young couple in my hotel and go hiking with them to see the stars or decide to dine with the local guide and his family. There is no ‘must-see’ or ‘must-do’ on my list anymore. I still pencil down the broad outline but I have learnt to leave some room for the unexpected.That gorgeous sunset, walking through the clouds, sitting by the beach for hours together doing nothing.. these are things I would trade my designer shoes or fancy labels for, with no second thoughts. The smile I shared with the tea vendor’s little daughter, the taste of the local beer I worried myself sick over the decisions I had made in the past or the things I needed to achieve in the future to feel ‘accomplished’. But travelling taught me to live in the moment. To learn from the past and build a better future. But most importantly, to learn to “slow down to smell the roses”. Sipping tea, sitting outside the Rumtek Monestery, Gangtok with little Lamas playing catch in the background was far more fulfilling than a fat paycheck.To have parents who trust me to make the right decisions in life. Two crazy, adorable siblings who’d have my back even if I were wrong. Friends, who would stand by me no matter what… Standing before the vast expanse of Pangong Tso, near Ladakh, I was grateful for them all and each of the moments I have lived that have made me the ‘story-teller’ that I am, today.I was always very social. Making new friends almost came naturally to me. But to have made friends with a Bangladeshi and travelled to lands unexplored despite knowing each other for just a few hours would sound absurd. But that’s exactly what happens when two people bond over the love for travel! Trusting a stranger becomes your second nature. And before you realise, you have found a friend for life.Travel has shown me how much more there is to life! Read a book, talk to a stranger, learn a new language, play an instrument, go for a walk. There is just so much to do in life. I have learnt to always find something interesting to keep me occupied. I, now know how exciting and thrilling any new experience can be.I learnt to unplug. I was never the one to be addicted to my phone or i-pod. But being on the road has taught me how I can absolutely survive without them. I have no urge to check my notifications or upload my pictures instantly on multiple social networks. Given a book, a pencil and a nice cup of tea, I am the happiest, that I’ll ever be.Travelling has humbled me in ways that nothing before ever had. Lying down in the sands on Arambol beach, Goa, looking up at the infinite stars, I realised I am just a Travel writer. Compulsive wanderer. Dreamer.

It’s that time again. Travel weariness sets in.For some a week, others a year. Me — nearing the last week of 2 months.In the last 2 months:I haven’t slept in the same bed for more than 7 days.I’ve lost money. Saved money. Received lodging and meals for free.I had my purse stolen. In it was my wallet from my protege student who’s all grown up now. In the wallet was the 2 dollar bill that my oldest friend wore in her wedding as her something borrowed. I’d carried it for 16 years before that and was her maid of honor.I went home for the first time in a year.I’m in my last Canadian city, debilitated by allergies, dehydrated from so many plane, train and road miles, dazzled by the view from the skyscraper apartment.I’ve been cursed by 50 chigger bites, put 5 people on Periscope — many for the first time.Love,Worlds first iPod silhouette, aerial and blues dancer, nomad.

Boy, did it wake me up: the fact was that during three years of struggling to make payroll (despite working 12-hour days), my partner and I weren’t really doing something we were passionate about. We were only doing something we were comfortable with. It made me a better entrepreneur that day to realize that, while comfort may be included in the trappings of success, passion is the key ingredient to running and growing a business.The ironic thing is: Big Omaha also happened to be where a small seed was planted — a small, humble seed, but a seed that I could clearly see growing. Big Omaha was where I decided to turn one of my business ideas into a new startup — and to devote myself full-time to turning this startup into successful business venture. What I learned was that — more than any talk or presentation, more than fancy slides or inspirational photo booths — it is the act of surrounding yourself with people committed to innovation that can really push you. What a powerful thing it is, too. It reminds you that you can’t wait around for someone to do something someday. That someone is you and that something is today.I look at this as one of the perfect examples of how the journey is just as important as — if not more important than — the destination. There is always so much to see and hear and learn along the way; this is especially true for entrepreneurs. And if, at some point, you get lost or make a wrong turn, don’t let it stop you from working, moving, and trying.Right after learning this lesson (which I certainly learned the hard way), I moved to Medellín, up in Colombia’s beautiful Aburrá Valley, in an apartment with a daily view of the sun setting over the Andes. There I became an instant fan of making dollars and spending pesos. In trying to find a way to reduce my operating costs, I also discovered a better, more affordable place to live.Same applies to business. Don’t hesitate to go the extra mile to find out where your best options are. If you need to source fabric from China, source fabric from China. As for me, I recently hired a designer in Florida, a developer from Russia, an engineering team in Hyberabad, and a writer in Manila. Outsourcing has allowed me to be resource-efficient; more importantly, it has enabled me to see the world as my office, and to find great talent wherever it can be found.As an entrepreneur, I see a common thread that ties together all these diverse personal and professional experiences. It doesn’t matter whether I’m speaking to a French computer programmer, a Peruvian shoeshine guy, a Russian millionaire, a vagabond Colombian, or a Chilean winemaker: we’re all trying to solve problems. Everyone, in one way or another, is hoping to make today better than yesterday and tomorrow better than today.In this light, it’s clearer to me that business is not just a way of making money and becoming rich; it is first and foremost a social institution, at the foundation of which is the passion to solve problems and make things better, either for one’s self or for others. It thus comes to no surprise that all this traveling, scratching around, adjusting, planning, failing, and improvising has allowed me to develop my entrepreneurial instincts. As Steve Jobs once said, “I just want to put a ding in the universe.” So do I, and to be honest I don’t care which part of the universe I end up putting it.CEO of 

The employment world sells the 40h week. When hours are reached (usually on the weekend), the world stops. The tourism world sells worry-free vacation for the typical tourist. Again, while in vacation, the world stops.In fact, the world never stops. That’s why we need new models of tourism (traveling) and more people becoming self-employed business owners.This The Too much for you?

Feeling this connection you’re willing to learn, connect to local people, nature, animals and plants to initiate a dialogue and exchange.

Life is short, and painfully so. There’s no question about this universal sentiment. The tragically transient nature of life, however, is in part what lends to the beauty of it. You can only fill it with so many experiences given the finite amount of time you are allotted. It is then important to pay special heed to the For me (and I’d venture to say for much of the masses), I think a good, meaningful life can be determined in terms of perceived length of one’s time and the quality of experiences that make up said time. The longer the time feels — and assuming it is of worthwhile quality — the better the life. So how can one achieve such an earthly existence? At the risk of sounding like a naive twenty-something with a penchant for platitudes, I believe that Imagine your formative childhood years. Across the board, it’s arguably so that these years felt subjectively longer than the present speed at which your years travel. There are Now compare the act of traveling with your formative years. There are many parallels. When you travel, or place yourself in a novel environment, you are metaphorically becoming a child again in that context and consequently expanding your perception of time. You are essentially transporting yourself into an extended situation in which you are effectively unfamiliar with your surroundings and forced to deduce how to properly behave and get by. You are living in a “not-quite-sure state of mind,” as I like to call it. Just as if you were a kid again, you are forced to learn and take on new challenges, whether you want to in the moment or not. But it’s not a dreadful experience. Although taxing, traveling and growing up are both stimulating and fulfilling.People in general would rather live a long life as opposed to a short life. Yet, how long or short a life is cannot be measured merely in terms of years lived, for time is a completely subjective and relative experience. Imagine that Person A and Person B live the same length, 100 years. Person A spends her life in the comfort of her abode, doing exactly the same activities every day. Person B, on the other hand, makes a conscious effort to spice up her life by mixing up her daily routine, learning new skills, and visiting foreign places. It’s intuitive that subjectively, Person B lived a “longer life,” so to speak. A particular length of time could very well be perceived as short to one person and long to another, and therein lies the key to living a full life. Because time is an individual experience, it is paramount that we fill it with quality experiences that To me, a meaningful life does not necessarily entail grand achievements or gross financial success. Rather, a good life necessitates a subjective fullness of time, insofar as the time spent passing is one of meaning, self-cultivation, and learning — not one of vapid time-filling. And traveling provides just that sort of non-literal time extension. So the next time you’re stuck feeling like a cog in the machine, journey out to some unfamiliar terrain. It doesn’t even need to be some faraway fantastical land; just place yourself in a new environment. You can’t slow the tick-tock of the clock, but you can certainly get appropriately uncomfortable.resident dilettante. nyc denizen. follow me on twitter democracy in the digital age.

Lots of people write blog posts about their trips around the world, where they describe the amazing places they have seen, the food they ate and the people they have met. Many travelers create photo albums on Flickr, post articles on Medium, or simply have a series of check-ins on Facebook to make their friends jealous.Unfortunately, writing a blog post, taking the perfect photo or checking-in on Facebook is often more of a distraction than anything else. For this reason I have been thinking for a while about building a tool that would do all of this for you. You walk around, visit a place, enjoy the experience, and there will be someone else that will take care of building some sort of In a world where almost everybody has a smartphone in their pocket, and more and more people wear smart watches and smart bracelets this is actually quite easy to accomplish. It can be made super fancy and super customizable, but creating the core functionality is really not that hard.This week I had a few spare hours in the evening and I thought it would be nice to see what I could hack together in a short period of time. The idea was to create some sort of The final result is visible here: The ideal scenario would be that when you are visiting a city, a park or any other place, every time you stop to admire something interesting (landmarks, buildings, sculptures) or to rest in a park, an event with a location attached is triggered.This would be easy to accomplish with a simple mobile application, however for my prototype I wanted to write almost no code. Therefore I decided that even tapping a button would be fine for now, and I went with There may be wearables that can be used together with IFTTT and trigger the same event automatically, replacing the need for the button.IFTTT has unfortunately one big issue: it does not POST data to custom endpoints. Somebody found Now, this email needs to get to the core component of my tool. Of course I did not want to setup a mail server that receives these emails. Luckily there are services out there that can be configured to receive emails and transform them into API calls to any endpoint. I went with All the pieces that constitute this tool are fairly dumb. They trigger events, forward data from one place to another, store data, and show data. However there is With some more coding this step can be made a lot smarter and used to combine together multiple services to retrieve more precise and richer information about the detected location (photos, Wikipedia articles, tweets, etc.), but goes beyond the scope of this first prototype.Once the place is identified, the information is posted somewhere else so it can be stored, edited later on and extracted to be displayed in a pretty web page.This components was developed as a quick and dirty node.js application that is running on For storage I signed up for Contentful provides As shown in the screenshot above, all the data from the The final piece is The location field is used to render map tiles for places by using, once again, This page was built with a bit of jQuery, mustache.js and looks This little experiment proves that this concept that I’ve had in mind for a while can actually be implemented fairly easily and quite cheaply. It also shows that there are really no reason for IFTTT to keep not implementing WebHooks. Developers will find a way to obtain the same thing. I had the chance to play with Contentful and their API, and gave me some more insights into it: who knows, I may try to use it for one of my future work projects.

I like to think I’ve done a fair bit of travelling around and I have plenty more left in me. This is what I’ve learned along the way. Chances are you will find most of these common sense (hopefully) and some might be a little obscure or totally irrelevant. There’s only one way to find out, read on …Apologies for the quality of some photos, they’re designed to accompany the writing and not necessarily look super pretty. Some were taken by friends and some by me.This is number one on most lists and comes down to how comfortable you are feeling. When in San Francisco earlier this year I had a 60L pack for 11 days. The first 7 days were for work and the rest were a bit of me time. I really wish I had just taken half the clothes I took and snook some more beer back at the end. It became a burden getting on and off public transport and constantly rifling through it to find one particular thing. Also I packed my Aeropress to only use once the entire time I was there.The hostel in San Francisco I ended up staying at had great facilities for cleaning and drying clothes (as most do). Even without that you can wash your clothes in a sink and then hang them out to dry. Next time you go travelling wear things you can get away with wearing a couple of times before washing them. Merino garments work great for this as they are great at wicking away sweat and remain fairly odourless. When I go snowboarding I wear Merino base layers all week and never feel uncomortable or dirty. I also have a shirt from For me it’s so nice to look back on things that you have done and I found a whole lump of written diaries and Blogspot posts of my year I spent in New York and it just reminded me of how powerful it can be to see what you have done to inspire you to do more. The feelings that are invoked when you look back on an adevnture really drive me to make more memories like thatIn this digital age we live in everyone has a camera on them thanks to mobile phones and technological advances making electronics better and more compact. Whatever camera you decide to take, make sure you know how to use it, understand it’s limitations and how to get the best out of it. One thing that get’s me annoyed is when someone has been on holiday and they come back with 200 photos of pretty much the same thing with half of them blurred, out of focus or ruined by using flash. It may seem like I’m being a pretentious fool (I am, but that’s beside the point), but a photo is meant to tell a story and give some context.The other side of the coin is what I have been guilty of in the past; taking each and every bit of gear you think you need. You always end up leaving some important part back at your lodgings andyou constantly juggle batteries and chargers. Instead of focusing on capturing an awesome moment you spend your timing maintaining your gear or pondering over which lens to use. Be super critical of yourself with regards to what you think you need and what you actually need. Experience will tell you what is best to take for the situation you may find yourself in. My favourite thing for city breaks at the moment is using my Canon G16 and editing them on my iPhone thanks to wi-fi. It’s really compact, non-intrusive and produces relatively decent photos for online content. I also used it for my Some people I know are in constant pursuit of endless adventure and I do admire them setting off on their own. For me personally I think an adavnture is so much more when shared with a good friend or several of them. I have travelled to a few places on my own and I do find it easy to make friends but when you’re back home it’s hard to share that experience or relive it again. You are never truly alone if you set off on your own as you meet people along the way, I understand that but it’s just not for me.One of my fondest memories is of me and three friends going on a road trip all over California (with a quick stop in Las Vegas) taking each day as it came. Chilling out, drinking beer by the pool playing around with waterproof cameras and of course drinking more beer. We still talk about that adevnture and all the little stories that went along with it. It’s been about 4/5 years since we did the trip and neither of us have dared touch the 100GB of footage we took while we were there. That reminds me based on the previous point, don’t leave your photos gathering digital dust on a hard drive they’re meant to be shared!Like most normal people I listen to music an awful lot. I’m lucky in the fact that I can listen to music while in the office (when I’m actually there) or if I’m travelling around Spotify and my headphones are trusty travel companions. There have been a few trips that we created special playlists for. In Iceland it was filled with a lot of Before we went to Iceland we had a pretty rigid plan of where we needed to be, how many miles we needed to cover and the best way to get there. A lot of time was spent looking at various recommendation sites, tourist information and a lot of Instagram trawling. With regards to finding out way around we did use our iPhones, but we also relied heavily on a map to find our way around. It was quite fun using the map and it certainly means you pay a lot more attention to the surroundings rather than waiting for a voice to tell you to turn left or right.Rigid plan in place we also built in plenty of free time to go explore and my God it was worth it. Daylight was always on our side as it stayed light well past 10pm and never truly got dark. We took in an awful lot of the south of Iceland and even touched the eastern region. The greatest part was Gulfoss. Words cannot do Gulfoss justice. Lot’s of people reference Niagara Falls when talking about Gulfoss. They are in different leagues in my opinion. Gulfoss is one of the single, most beautiful, breathtaking and terrifying things I have ever laid eyes upon. Just goes to show you if you’re willing to get a bit lost then it can be truly rewarding.I’m sure most of this you have heard most of this before but speaking from experience, I really do believe you can’t go wrong with having these tips to help guide you to a truly awesome adventure.Beer.

For a few years around 2012, I experienced a massive mental awakening.While traveling and living in India, my mind opened to a whole new perspective.What I observed in the culture shocked me.The The biggest mind opening experience was observing the people who were living in these extremely impoverished areas. When looking into many of their eyes, I sensed that they were in peace.Internally, they were fulfilled. The more I observed the culture, the more my mind opened.I saw that they found their fulfillment in time with family and friends…That they found enjoyment in kicking rocks down the side of the road and imagining they were playing in the world cup…I found excitement and curiosity every time I met their gaze. The curiosity and joy in each interaction I had while in India pulled at the boundaries and limitation I had structured in my mind.And although there were many times I did not feel safe and secure, I continued to make the decision to move into the resistance I felt.I wanted to explore more.I wanted my curiosity to shine in every moment.I wanted the joy of my heart to be felt and be free to express.I wanted to experience the internal freedom that I perceived they had.The more I opened to the experience of moment…the more I shed my walls and boundaries…the more interesting people I interacted with…the more beauty I experienced…And, most of all, the more I opened to each moment, the more emotion and energy I experienced in my body.In the past, the weight of the feeling would have pushed me to a point of internal collapse and I would have drowned out the clarity of what I really wanted.I stepped into each moment with the desire to open…to see how much magic could be created right here…right now…And throughout my time in India, I ended up traveling the country, meeting Bollywood stars, partying with India celebrities, and exploring how much my reality would respond to what I desired internal.I was exploring how much I could feel. And I remember feeling more than I could have ever imagined possible before…It was the first time, in a long time, that my creativity and inspiration…my inner child…felt completely free to play and be expressed.From that place of freedom, creative inspiration flew through me effortlessly.By the end of my time in India…I devised a idea for a mobile application…I began creating a team…And a company was created…It was effortless. It was easy.The perceived weight of the world felt like it was pushing up against the new reality I was creating for myself.Explorer of Consciousness. Featured in 

I got Nick’s call early in the morning. My stomach already tightened in the dreary anticipation of yet another rejection. “Amanda! If you come to Denver at 5PM today, you show up hungry and then write a piece for my travel startup called Seekr, I’ll help you out”.It felt like a scam. But I was hungry for content strategy opportunities. And as a grad student, I was just plain hungry. Pulling up to the 1585 Kingston Street Church I was immediately convinced that Nick had given me the wrong directions. It was hot outside and chain length fences outlined small auburn yards of boxed houses. Boom boxes played from lined cars and the heat from the afternoon sun seemed to slow everything in its path. Tentatively poking my head into the church’s empty lobby the feeling of comfort washed over me as I heard Nick’s deep voice and eager laughter. It was in this small familiarity that I became one of Seekr’s first end users. It was a moment that sucked me entirely into the experience, and although I was minutes away from the familiar, I was thousands of miles away from the expected.In the spectrum of faith that is practiced, ecclesiastical buildings share an intrinsic quality. They are community centers with hundreds of spare chairs, tables and the lingering musk of yesterday’s events. They bring people together. It is poetic that travel offers this same capability. Nick had created a magnet of community in the simple organization of a Saturday afternoon Kenyan potluck in a church basement.The author, Ted Conover talks about the fundamental humanity in eating a meal with a stranger and how intimate that transaction can be for two people who may not even share the same language. This idea resonated deeply when Jemimah took my hand to teach me about the food she had labored over the night before. I felt wide-eyed when she shared her story of immigrating to the United States from Kenya. There was something in the indisputable warmth of this woman that made me feel protective of her. In some intangible way, I fiercely wanted good things to happen to Jemimah in the city I grew up in.Seekr’s founding principle is that of connection. The startup taps into the behavior that inadvertently brings people closer together while asking them to leave the familiar, if even for a few moments. Seekr creates relationships in the knowledge of a shared interest, an undisclosed local gathering spot and the universal behavior of what it means to be human.Before I left the potluck, Jemimah and her friends took my hands and told me I was a true Kenyan. There was an authenticity in the way they taught me to dance according to their local customs. There was also a reality in the excitement they shared, and it made me hungry to reciprocate. Travel isn’t always about the miles traversed, but the connections we make in the unexpected.

If there’s one thing we all have in common, it’s a great desire to travel the world.From college student to celebrity — regardless of what we do, who we are or how much money we make we all have dreams of one day being able to just quit our job and soak in unique cultures (and food!) from around the world.Our quest for adventure is universal.And more often that not we can find ourselves feeling trapped in our daily lives, unable to get un-stuck — or even worse… settle for less than we can achieve.The truth though, is that there is always another way.Another perspective on life that shows us just how vast and incredible the opportunities are when you give yourself a chance.When you break free from conventional thinking and take a leap of faith towards your most wildest dreams and desires.That life doesn’t have to be played out the way society has told us.Steve Jobs once said that (and i’m paraphrasing) most people think of life as a box, where things run according to a very specific structure. What most people don’t know is that we all have permission to poke the box.To question why things are the way they are and to make changes in terms of all of the things that we aren’t happy with (and want to change).This weeks book recommendation I know that I do on a daily basis.I’ve been feeling stuck a lot lately, and I can’t wait to delve deep into reading this highly acclaimed and highly recommended book.I’m sure the ideas inside will be worth their weight in gold.And I’m looking forward to have you join me in this wonderful adventure.To name a few…Vagabonding is about taking time off from your normal life — from six weeks to four months to two years — to discover and experience the world on your own terms.

Facebook created an amazing playground for advertisers to reach people based on their demographics, social status, interests, and even their behavior. What it does when used right, it gives the marketer a unique opportunity to adjust a dedicated creative message for each person. Working for a travel tech startup with a super challenging marketing mission, I study and explore hundreds of targeting methods and their combinations, on the Facebook ad platform, to drive our prospects’ attention to our value proposition and bring them true value.Facebook lets you target people in your geographic location by 4 characteristics:For me, the last one is the most fascinating, as I can combine it with lots of That allows you to target people with upcoming events in their lives or life events that recently happened, e.g., people whose birthday is within one week, or couples that are about to celebrate an anniversary in the next 30 days, or people who become engaged in the past 6 months.Facebook was thinking very creatively when they also allowed the targeting of friends of people who are having a specific life event.I especially love those methods that go along with a romantic kind of creative and try to catch people who are into an intimate weekend in Paris or something.In the last year, Facebook added an interesting opportunity for advertisers to target people whose original country is different from the targeted location you chose. You can find it in the Behaviors section. It is a bit similar to the location targeting at the beginning of the post, but it allows you to target people who were also originally born or live in a different country. Here is how you can combine Expats targeting with the “people traveling in this location” geo-targeting method:That will set up your potential audience reach to include only Facebook users who are originally from the U.S. that live at least 100 miles from the UK and their recent location was in the UK, aka traveling in the US. Let’s emphasize this one with a more specific example: You can target someone who is originally from Brooklyn, NYC, who has worked and lived in Amsterdam for the last couple of years and is on a business trip in London at the moment.While the geo-location drop down menu lets you select people who were recently located (by their mobile location services) in a location that is at least 100 miles from their home, the behavioral targeting of people who are “currently traveling” lets you target Facebook users who were recognized by Facebook algorithms as ones that their activities on Facebook (check-ins, engagements with certain content, etc.) point out on that that they are currently traveling.This method opens up the opportunity to target residents of a specific location who are at the moment traveling somewhere in the world, e.g., people who live in London and are currently traveling somewhere.Pay attention to the fact that due to Facebook’s OR logic (for Interests and Behaviors targeting) you cannot mix this method with the Expats targeting. Well, you technically can, but it will create an audience of Facebook users who are EITHER current OR traveling expats. In other words, it won’t unite the two methods and create a mixture that combines only individuals who are BOTH currently traveling AND expats. (BTW third party marketing partners of Facebook are able to implement an AND logic on Behavior and Interests targeting).It might look like a very basic targeting method, but the real beauty of it is combining it with the “people traveling in this location” method. That, for example, will let you target people near specific hotels or airports. If you want to target people near large central airports (JFK, Heathrow, etc.), you don’t even need a zip or an address, just the name of the airport and it will find the location automatically.Last thing I would like to say before the conclusion, and it will be the most important message that I want to send you. All of these methods and amazing features that Facebook brings to the marketing and advertising world are in my opinion only tools that should help us make better creatives for our ads using the right and relevant context. For example: if you want to sell a hotel room for people who are traveling near an upcoming music festival venue, you should try and target people who are travelling there, are fans of a band that is performing at the festival, then tag the band in your ad’s creative or provide information about their gig or about the area the band members are staying during the festival, etc. That will get you the attention and the engagement you need to be able to provide the value you want to your targeted audience and sell your stuff.And that would be itCheers,I’m All About PPC  Online Advertising.

For as long as she can remember, Eckert was fascinated with Africa. It was something about the exotic animals and the people there — she wanted to go to Africa.“I just always had it in my bones, even when I was a little kid I wanted to go to Africa,” she says.When she was in high school, President John Kennedy formed the Peace Corps.“I thought ‘that’s my ticket to Africa.’”But before she could trek to Africa, Eckert spent a summer in Europe with college friends. The trip included an excursion to Greece.“That just blew me away. I was hooked. I thought ‘that’s it — I have to travel,” she says.were on their way to Sierra Leone. For three years, Eckert did medical work in tetanus prevention in newborns. She showed locals how to boil tools used to cut babies’ umbilical cords to kill germs so they wouldn’t get tetanus.During those three years in West Africa, Eckert and her husband lived in a mud house without lights or running water.“It was the biggest adventure of my life,” she says.After moving home to the States and going through a divorce, Eckert decided it was time to explore a new path.“I realized I wasn’t going to travel around the world with my husband now. I thought ‘What can I do that I can still travel and see the world?’” she says. The answer to her question was adventure travel. More specifically, it was to start an adventure travel company just for women.“(Adventure travel) was just becoming a thing. Every company out there was pretty much focused on men. There weren’t a lot of women doing it,” she says. Eckert had completed all of her PhD coursework except her dissertation when she decided to quit the program and start her business Eckhert credits adventure travel for changing her life and, essentially, becoming her life. But she’s not the only one who has been so deeply impacted by this type of travel.“It has changed me in almost every way possible,” says Sawrah Amini, travel blogger for Adventure travel is often defined as a type of tourism that involves exploration or travel with perceived or actual risk. In some cases, adventure travel may also include the possibility of requiring specialized skill and physical exertion — think mountain climbing or skiing. That may also include traveling to a location for hiking, bungee jumping, white water rafting and more.“It’s doing things that maybe you haven’t done before,” Eckert says. “It’s taking yourself out of your own comfort zone and even learning a new skill.”While Amini’s first taste of adventure travel wasn’t conventionally extreme, it was certainly an adventure that was out of her comfort zone. When she was 16, she traveled to Spain for two weeks.“It was so different than my normal life. Today I wouldn’t consider it adventure travel necessarily, but when I look back, it was extreme given my life up until that point,” she says. That trip was her first experience abroad, without her parents, in a place where English wasn’t the predominant language where she was exposed to structures and culture she never knew existed — and she fell in love with international travel.“It was during that trip that I had my first death defying bus ride, got lost in a big city and had to use my language skills to find my way back, and realized my ‘American-ness.’ Each trip from there on would get more adventurous and push my limits and comfort zone more and more,” Amini says. Since that first trip, she has traveled to 44 countries and more than 25 states in the U.S.So what is it about this type of tourism that attracts women? Sure, men are known to be drawn to risk and adventure for the thrill and “manliness” of it, but what do women get out of it?“Insatiable curiosity” is what Amini says keeps drawing her back.At its core, adventure travel is about satisfying one’s curiosity about the world and about themselves.“There is always so much more to learn and experience. Each person you meet while traveling will tell you about a place you haven’t been to or tell you about an activity you haven’t done and I always want to do it,” she says.Often, a significant life event will spur a woman to explore the world.“The big one is empowerment,” Eckert says of how adventure travel is different for women. “They feel empowered. They take that leap and they do it. They are so empowered — it makes a huge difference in their lives.”“Women often come back from adventure travel with a new or renewed self-confidence and the sense of ‘I feel like I can do anything,’” Eckert says. This change is something Eckert has personally watched happen on the trips she hosts.“It feels awesome to see that. I have women say to me ‘These trips have changed my life.’ But it wasn’t me. I provided the gateway, but they’re the ones responsible and credited with being open to changing their lives,” she says.Barbara McNally wrote “My divorce taught me to take risks,” she says.“The purpose of life after all is to live it, to taste each experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for new and rich experiences.”Cue adventure travel. Women are increasingly booking high-octane excursions like trekking mountains, horseback riding, and more for the adrenaline rush and female bonding. For instance, Amini has done everything from trekking in the Himalayas to camping out in the Mongolian country side to zip lining and canoeing through a rainforest in Costa Rica. Extreme, right?For Amini, her adventure travels have evoked a whole gamut of emotions and feelings.“I have felt everything from exhilaration and joy to complete and utter paralyzing fear. Even if you have done a lot of self-exploration, you never know when a situation during adventure travel is going to bring up a new emotion for you, every situation is new and unique to that exact moment in time and that is often times unpredictable emotionally,” she says.Traveling to a new destination to ski, bungee jump, experience a new culture, zip line, or some other thrilling activity may sound scary to a woman who has never had the opportunity to do so before. But, according to Eckert, the juice is worth the squeeze.“Leap, take the jump. A lot of women look into adventure travel because they want to do something different,” she says.Adventure travel offers the chance to see new places, experience and learn about new cultures, test your physical abilities and walk away feeling more confident and empowered.“We can all practice the art of adventure and exploration when we break the chains of routine and step out of our comfort zone,” says McNally, the author. “To me, traveling to new places, making new friends, and acquiring new viewpoints is living a creative life.”“I think adventure travel transforms you no matter the level of adventure. It enhances who you are as a person and brings new skills to your life regardless of age, gender or profession,” Amini says.I am a 20something journalist, content marketer and blogger in the Philadelphia-area with a passion for health, fitness, beauty and fashion.

Lately, the online world has become overwhelmed with travel inspiration websites, yet we are spending hours, days, or maybe even weeks in making a final decision for that trip we want to book. Why is this happening?This means that even though there are numerous services that are available to help you get inspired, make decisions, and book your trip, you still have to dig through tons of unstructured information, such as I faced the same problem when planning my trips, and, damn it, I got so tired of selecting wTourism everlasting student — traveller — dreamer

One of the most frequent questions I get asked since I started my travel blog is “People read my blog or follow me on Facebook and see that I travel a lot and say „Oh, you have such a wonderful life” and secretly think „and you must be so rich”.Yes, I have a great life. But I have a great life My husband and I have average wages, and my income is actually not at all steady, as I’ve been working for myself for quite some time now. I don’t have a fixed salary that I can rely on, like most people do. However, it’s sooo possible. And by doing so, not only will you be able to travel more, but actually you will be able to enjoy any other passion you might have, because most of these are actually principles that can be applied to anything else you desire. This is not just about travelling, it’s about anything else you feel you don’t have money for.As a side note, I need to say that I have money to travel because travel is my passion and I think people always find resources for the things they truly love and desire. So basically most of my spare money goes to travel. However, handling all other expenses is very demanding and most people just end up with a lot of debt, living from paycheck to paycheck, always in the rat race (been there, done that, so I know what it’s like).So this is how I have money to travel:I guess I could say I’m lucky, because some of the things that save me a lot of money are just things that come easy to me. It’s stuff that has to do with who I am and always have been, and not things I impose on myself or things I have to struggle to keep out of my life.Also, I am lucky I don’t like coffee or any carbonated drinks either. By not consuming any of these things (alcohol, cigarettes, coffee, carbonated drinks), I don’t only save a lot of money, but I also stay healthy, which basically means saving money twice. Or maybe ten+ times, if you think how expensive medical care is.Now, if you are a consumer of these things, I’m not saying you should eliminate them If you smoke, have you ever calculated how much money you spend on cigarettes a month? That money could buy you at least one (if not two) weekend trips. Do you really want to be spending that kind of money on something that might actually kill you rather that on something that you love?I know giving up smoking is not exactly a piece of cake, but I believe that if you truly desire something, you will find resources to succeed.Don’t get me wrong. I absolutely love music and having fun with friends, however… an extremely crowded place filled with smoke and drunk people is hardly my idea of quality entertainment. Going clubbing is simply something that doesnt get me excited (anymore. I used to like it in high school).If you on the other hand enjoy clubbing but still want to have money for travel or any other hobby you might have, try cutting back, since going to a club once or twice a week is quite expensive (which I’m sure you know very well).I know this might sound crazy, but it’s true. I’m a woman and I don’t like shopping :)) Going from store to store and browsing through enormous amounts of clothes is something that brings me absolutely no joy. It’s actually very annoying most of the time.If you enjoy shopping, that’s not a bad thing, but if you find yourself spending too much, try budgeting and leaving the house with no credit/debit cards, only the amount of cash you are comfortable spending.Sure, I like pampering myself from time to time with a nice dinner in a nice place, but I don’t feel the need to make a habit out of it. If I did, then I probably wouldnt appreciate it as much.One surely needs a haircut from time to time, but all other things I can just do at home by myself. For instance, I don’t like having colorful nails (it’s just not my style) and simply giving myself a natural manicure is something I can easily do at home by myself, for considerably less money.I like my house minimal, with very little decor and only furniture I need, not just something that means more surfaces to dust.I have never felt the urge to own expensive stuff. I don’t need an expensive car with all possible sensors and systems, I don’t need the biggest flat screen TV there is, I don’t need the latest, coolest smartphone, I don’t need designer clothing (however I spend a lot of money on mountain equipment and apparel, but that’s a different story :D), etc.If I think about it, I have never owned a new computer and my current smartphone is second hand. I don’t do this kind of stuff because I’m cheap, but because it’s just stuff I don’t really care about. For instance, I find absolutely no joy in thinking about buying the latest iPhone.If sections 1 and 2 above are about things that come natural to me, there are, however, others that are not as easy. It’s the things that But even if I do that, it’s still hard and sometimes I end up buying stuff I don’t actually need. Why is it so hard? Because all throughout time weve always been fed these brain-washing ideas that we need this and that, when in fact, it’s all coming from companies’ need to sell stuff. Stuff we don’t really need, but by brain washing, weve come to think we cannot live without. What can we do to fight this?Whenever you want to buy something, either in a real store or while you are sitting comfortably in your chair browsing stuff online, take a moment and think about it: Do you want to buy this because you really think it brings value/utility to your life, or do you want to buy it because everybody has it and youve come to believe that’s how things should be?For instance: Do you really need a bookcase / big TV unit in the living room? (if you’re a book collector, then maybe the answer is yes) Or could you maybe do without and just “nail” the TV to the wall? (if you have a TV. If you don’t, even better).Now, even if after youve thought about it thoroughly youve found that you need it, don’t go ahead and buy it just yet. Why? Because we live in a consumer society. Instead, it’s time to think outside the box, be creative and ask yourself more (crazy) questions:1. Do I need it new?2. Is it something I can’t make myself for a lot less money?3. Is it something I can’t find elsewhere, but cheaper?4. Is it something I can’t find a cheaper or even free alternative for?5. Is it something I can’t borrow?Now, only if after careful consideration and research (some things you can do by yourself a lot easier than you think — search for DIY tutorials), the answer to all 5 of the above questions above is If not, figure out which of the 5 you can go with. Examples:Do you really need to buy a new bed or can you save a lot of money by making your own bed from wood pallets for instance? Do you really need to buy new furniture or can you find really good deals for almost new stuff on Ebay / Craigslist / garage sales? Do you need to buy clothes at the mall or can you find the exact same quality in a different place which is less expensive? (Oh please don’t go to the mall anymore, it’s such a money sucking invention!!!). Do you really, I mean My husband and I spent a When you have a baby for example, before buying every single item you find in baby stores, ask yourself if you (or the baby) First time parents fall into this kind of trap most easily. Because when your first baby comes, you are panicked, you feel like you have no idea how to take care of your baby, and everything is so scary. And it’s easy to believe that everything a store sells is something the baby needs. But it’s crap. 80% of what those stores sell (or any other store for that matter) is useless crap, stuff that just piles up in your house and takes up so much space that you feel like you need a bigger house. And so the hole grows deeper.Now, if you already have a lot of useless stuff in your house (who am I kidding, of course you have, we Take a look at every single object in your house and if you don’t use it, sell it on Ebay / Craigslist / etc. I even sold my curtain drapes that I’ve been hating for 4 years, but dragged out buying new ones because, let’s be honest, curtain drapes are so freaking expensive. But then, after I sold the old ones, I used the money to buy new ones.At the moment, with the annual budget that I have for travel, I could: 1) go on only one expensive vacationor2) go on 2–3 cheaper vacations and numerous weekend mountain tripsIt’s really quite simple, basic math: if you don’t have an income that allows you to have expensive vacations and stay in 5 star hotels, then in order to travel A LOT, you have to travel cheap (at least until you figure out how to make more money).Cheap doesnt necessarily mean you will have to refrain from everything For For For For For Also, take a second to figure out on your own if a tourist attraction is something you most definitely need to see. For instance, if you’re not passionate about art, don’t go to the Louvre just because I’ll be honest. I had debt and lived from paycheck to paycheck for a looong time. And like most people with money problems, I had money problems because I didnt have financial education. If you also don’t have any financial education, you shouldnt feel too shamed, because nobody teaches us about it. But this should actually be one of the compulsory classes taught in school from an early age. Ok, but There are lots and lots, but most say the same old things. Most promise you will be out of debt in a heartbeat, while others even promise to teach you how to get rich. Don’t fall into that trap. Those are just titles that authors used so they can sell more books. The truth is none of these books will tell you about an incredible secret that will help you get out of debt or get rich, a secret that they alone discovered and nobody else knows.No, all books contain the same financial principles to help you get back on your feet (if you have debt) or save or invest money. The only difference between them is how cleverly the information was structured into steps and how well did the author succeed in presenting it in a simple and useful matter, so it can actually help you and make it easier for you to get started and organized.For beginners, a good book might be Your Money or Your life or The Total Money Makeover. Be ready to also be fed a lot of inspirational and motivating crap, but if you filter through that, you will find solid methods and principles that you can apply (although most are not easy, I warn you!) in order to get your finances in order.One other instrument I found very useful is to read personal finance blogs. There are many out there, but the one I find more in tune with me is There are also other good blogs that might be worth looking into in order to see which one suits you bests, such as Don’t forget! Just as reading my article is not enough to change your mindset overnight and incorporate the advice in your lifestyle, just opening these blogs now and closing the tabs after a couple of minutes is not going to cut it.Actually, don’t spend any amount of time browsing through them right now at all (especially since you’ve spent so much on reading my article already :))). Just subscribe to a couple of newsletters and wait for them to send you news (and later, when you have the time, you can search through their archives a bit).This is the There were times when I had a A few years ago, I wasnt aware I was sometimes buying things I didnt necessarily need and I didnt have the mindset to try to find alternatives for the ones I did need. But now, when I see TV commercials telling people to get bank loans for stuff like getting a big flat screen TV, renovating the house, going on vacation or even the most absurd things (like getting a dog), I am outraged.There is, of course, one case when it There are a lot of questions to answer and a lot of things to consider, so think long and hard before you Another thing you should stay away from other than bank loans, are credit cards (which are basically bank loans as well, only for less money, but with a lot more risks). I know so many people who went through or go through enormous financial trouble because of that, that I could talk about it for hours. At first you use them once or twice a month, and by the time you know it, you are paying Then, installments start piling up and you end up with a huge monthly installment that is harder and harder to pay as the months go buy. It becomes a dread, and when you receive your monthly excerpt on your email telling you how much you have to pay and realize you don’t have the money or you will have to jump through hoops to get it, you panic. You feel like someone is strangling you!I’m sure most of you won’t be convinced they are also evil just because I say so. But if you read some good financial education books and/or blogs, you will understand why they are not and you should stay as far away from them as possible. It’s no news that time is money. So basically, wasting time equals wasting money, either it’s directly or indirectly.With most of my day divided between work, my blog, house chores, reading about my hobbies and reading about financial education, there’s hardly any time left to do anything else. However, everybody has a little (or, in some cases, a lot of) spare time for other activities. And choosing how to spend this time can make a huge difference when it comes to finances. Therefore:Instead, every little bit of spare time I have left I use in such a way that is beneficial and useful: generating passive income, investing in myself (reading, learning new things, etc.) and, of course, a little bit of relaxing also, because being active from dusk to dawn will take a toll on one’s health sooner or later.It’s actually very simple: if it’s not useful, likable or relaxing/amusing, I don’t do it. And if I find myself doing something like that, I try to stop as soon as possible. However, this is not something easy to do, and it takes huge amounts of willpower and lucidity.Most people think that this kind of lifestyle (cutting back, choosing something cheaper over something expensive, investing spare time in useful things) just means living a miserable life, with no joy. But that’s completely untrue. This kind of lifestyle doesnt mean that you have to deny yourself ALL pleasures and always buy only the necessities, nothing else… or else.No, all you need to cut back on is the stuff that is not that important to you, the stuff that you wouldnt miss anyway, the stuff that doesnt make your life better. And by doing that, you can actually have time and money for the stuff you Hi there! I’m a travel blogger and mountaineer from Romania. You can check out my blog here: 

The sun had gone down hours ago, and the world around me had already fallen asleep. My street had almost no streetlights, and the dark outlines of the shapes outside my windows barely breached the inky blackness. People walking by were rare and at times were the only sound besides the light wind gently flowing through the yearning leaves of the tree outside.I sat on my couch, watching television with the lights off. This was back in the days of when people still watched cable programming regularly, and I had been captivated by a movie on The credits in the beginning informed me that the movie was based on a book: “The Club Dumas” by a Spaniard, Arturo Perez-Reverte. It wasn’t until fairly recently that the book was given to me as a Christmas present and I had begun to read it.There’s a reason they say “read the book before watching the movie”. The book was great, the imagery and characters were fantastic. But for me, the images of the book had already been formed. The coarse character of Dean Corso had already been interpreted and the setting had already been born into the flesh.I couldn’t help but recall what I had already seen rather than imagine the eccentric characters and locations throughout the book for myself. My imagination had been robbed of the opportunity to paint the book for me, resorting to the crutch of the already seen.That is how I feel about the imagination’s kryptonite of our time — travel oversharing. Let me give you, my faithful reader, an example.Go to your Facebook news feed and look up someone who has gone on vacation. More likely than not you will find an endless stream of photos.When that friend comes back, the picture has already been painted for anyone unlucky enough to have seen it. The travel stories will lose some of their lustre, and the image of those cobblestone streets or majestic minarets or sandy beaches will already by firmly implanted in the listener’s ear.Like Dean Corso will always be Johnny Depp in my head, the captivation of imagination will be gone from the travel narrative.Some might say that people have been doing this forever, when they bring back a big batch of photos that they promptly share with everyone as soon as the roll of film is developed. But at least in that case, the story accompanies the images. As they show you that Creative web developer and technocrat working around the world.

Pretty comfy, yummy burgers — you’re gonna love it! And don’t miss the bar in the back of the place — it looks awesome with all these lighted bottles.”I got these recommendations from friends via Facebook, WhatsApp or even on the phone. So, same problem here again. I have to google it, read about it and evaluate if it fits my style. Lot’s of work to do. I want to focus on the nice things of the upcoming trip.It’s all about the feeling that arises while talking and thinking about these places. It’s about the pictures we imagine about them, it’s about the feelings they carry. It’s about the relation between them and you — will you match? Sounds a bit like dating. I took this approach and realized an emotional user experience based on strong images. It will be easy to navigate so the user can focus on the big pictures and videos of the destination. Here is how your personal results will be presented to you. Notice the green circle showing your personal fit rate for Paris?You can dive even deeper into one city. Let’s say you are interested in visiting Paris. You want to check out more about the city. See the people, bars and what’s worth seeing, where to spend your time.I absolutely love the way AirBnB is giving you emotional insights into a city with featured After being convinced of the city the user is presented with the best matching hotels and activities, such as restaurants and bars.

Tell me everything!” Yap, been there. That’s the most fun part. We live for stories to tell. We tell our friends about our experiences, the cool bar we found, the sweet girl we’ve seen in this park near the river. We tell stories about our trips. Our stories transport feelings, emotions.With tripsuit you will write even better stories. At least, thats the way I imagine it. You will experience the good stories setting you apart from the people around you, because you find the spots no one else was visiting because they got the standard recommendations and tourist spots from their travel provider.

“The world is a book, and those who don’t travel read only one page.” –St. AugustineAnybody who embraces the art of literature knows how text can transport you to other worlds. But, sometimes, stories take place in very real places, regardless of whether they are fiction or nonfiction. Take, for example, the The desire for these connections isn’t limited to nonfiction writing. Reading books takes you to the book’s location, while visiting a book’s location plunges one deeper into the book and its characters. As I visited different places from Those photographs were taken in 2014, and the story is set during World War II, so the topography doesn’t match perfectly. However, the feelings are remain the same. Looking at the “shades of blue” and seeing Georgetown “spread out beneath us” still created a sense of awe and connection to the land below. It is commonly heard that “a picture is worth a thousand words.” If this is true, then how many words is travel worth? Climbing inside a book to the place where the characters felt emotions you connected with is worth volumes.My recommendation is to read and travel. Travel and read. The order doesn’t matter and the combination will invigorate your every sense. If possible, read stories of places you are going or places you have been. The reading will enhance your travel experience and you may find yourself seeking other texts that take place in locations you have been. If you enjoy understanding inside jokes, you’ll love recognizing landmark references to places you have seen, touched, soaked in. Traveling can give you a deeper connection to a book and its characters, and if you share the journey with another person, the connection turns tri-fold. Even if the story isn’t real, your own experience will be.Blogger  Short Story Author

The life of an entrepreneur is a funny thing. Some days you find yourself not being able to remember the last time you ate a meal or took a shower, feeling exhausted and creatively drained. The next you’re on a plane headed to some huge meeting or event, brimming with excitement and nervousness.But what does the life of an entrepreneur actually look like? Hang on tight, I’m about to share a slice or two of it with you!TLet’s start with where the majority of the entrepreneurial magic happens: I’m not exactly sure when it happened, but at some point after college I became a little bit of a neat-freak. Okay… Truthfully, I’m a little OCD with how tidy I like my workspace. But hey, there’s a reason for this. When my workspace is clean and free of clutter, I can easily getAs you can see, I don’t use an overly expensive setup. And yes, this is what my desk looks like almost all the time (like I said, I’m OCD, deal with it). Here are my desk essentials:If the cleanliness of my desk soothed your inner-OCD-monster, then I want to forewarn you about Caroline’s desk: I’d run out of bullet points if I let Caroline rattle off all the stuff on her desk, but there are a few key items that she simply can’t live without:One of the things Caroline and I value most about working for ourselves is the flexibility to be able to pick up and go at a moment’s notice. Over the years we’ve become very efficient when it comes to packing for trips.Much like the limited amount of things I keep on my desk, I don’t travel with a ton of stuff. I used to bring lots of extra things along as Fun and random, huh? Pretty much a visually organized representation of who I am as a person. Here’s the breakdown of what I keep in my travel bag:You might be shocked to see what’s coming next, but Caroline doesn’t actually just slide all the items from her desk into a plastic bag to bring with her Crazy organized, right!?! I know. So proud. Here’s what she keeps close at-hand in her travel bag:I won’t bore you with each item we put in our suitcases, but I will share a couple packing tips we’ve learned over the years.This is more for me than Caroline, but it’s amazing how much room a slightly larger pair of shoes can take up in your suitcase.If anyone reading this has a family member in the military, then you know the beauty of rolling your clothes. This is an absolute must and actually helps keep clothing wrinkle-free-ish.I know, I said I wouldn’t bore you with suitcase item details, but this is a type for my dude-readers. Buy a pair of This is a hard-and-fast rule for a couple reasons. One, it makes the travel process way more efficient (leave me and my idiosyncrasies alone!). Two, it forces you not to empty your entire closet into a suitcase that becomes heavy, that you have to pay to check, and that causes you to wait in baggage claim watching the conveyer belt of hope (hoping that your bag made it safely, that is).You’ll notice we only travel with Samsonite luggage. Full transparency, they reached out and offered to hook us up with luggage and we couldn’t say no to fancy new bags. Especially Caroline, whose previous rolling suitcase looked (and sounded) like it squared off in a gladiatorial arena with a disgruntled airline crew worker. Seriously, you could hear that thing and its bum wheel coming from an entire terminal away.The bags we own are as follows:We recently went on a trip and as we were walking out the door, with the exact stuff you see above, we realized how much of a minimal lifestyle we’ve established. We could easily travel for weeks on end bringing only what you see above (and we have!).When we aren’t at home, our favorite places to work are unique coffee shops. There’s just something about the smell of fresh coffee, the vibe of the place, and the people coming and going that creates an atmosphere we love.It’s taken us a few years of trial and error, but we’ve figured out how to run our businesses efficiently no matter where we are. Whether we have to hop on a plane at a moment’s notice (yes, it’s happened before) or we just need a change of scenery to get the creative juices flowing, our work process is a well-oiled machine. No matter where we are when our next big ideas hit, we’re ready to make them happen.What if you don’t do things the way everyone else does them? I like doing stuff.The place Jason Zook puts all his top secret Medium articles (that aren’t secret at all). Get these delivered to your inbox by going to MoreJason.com.

I have traveled a lot. Well, I have traveled a lot in Europe. This is the first of a series of pieces I am making on the major countries I have been to. The order in which I post them is absolutely indicative of which ones I love most. Unlike my last pieces, these will be accompanied by plenty of pictures and pretty much no social commentary (OK, maybe a little bit).My experiences in France are the first ones I am going to delve into. I’m not going to talk about Paris here, because that is a gem worthy of its own piece. So without further ado, I present La Belle France.The Loire River Valley is the first marvel of architectural beauty that I encountered outside of Paris. The beauty is not found in the small towns of the Loire, but rather cradled within the forests and along the river itself. They spring out of the the miles of thick green trees and astonish every visitor. They are the The palaces of Chenonceau and Villandry were both uniquely resplendent. Chenonceau spans the width of a river and stands upon it with massive arches. Villandry commands control of a tiny village and has a massive garden with flowers of every color arranged in the most intricate patterns.From the Loire, I traveled north to Normandy. Here I encountered the highlight of northern France and one of the biggest highlights of my life: Mont San Michel. It is a massive rock a few miles out into the sea. On this rock is an abbey. Around this abbey is spiraling network of narrow medieval streets lined with small shops and restaurants going up to the cathedral itself. I was particularly lucky since the tide was low that day and instead of miles of water surrounding the abbey, there was sand. So, I took my shoes off and began trudging through it. I walked along this uniform, smooth surface for miles. No end in sight, just miles and miles of sand in every direction. Only the sharp roof of Mont San Michel broke the vast field of nothingness. I felt as though I was in a heavenly stage with no purpose or direction, just the desire to stand there and breathe the salty sea air.Mont San Michel was not the end of my spiritual experiences in France, however. A few days later, I visited the largest cathedral in France: Notre-Dame d’ Amiens. The sheer size of the basilica left my head spinning. The entrance was adorned with enormous arches, each with etchings of thousands of saints and biblical events. Inside, the ceilings seemed to reach as far as the sky. Alcoves held dark rooms lit by countless candles and surrounded with divine sculptures and paintings. But beyond this radiating wealth lay something that meant more to a Christian and than any worldly decoration. It was the head of Saint John the Baptist. I will not go into religious history and explain the significance of this saint, but stumbling upon one of the greatest relics of all time left me feeling overjoyed and immensely blessed on my journey.A few years later, I returned to France. This time I traveled to eastern France, the Rhone-Alpes region. Here I met the (geographic) love of my life. Her name is Annecy. She’s tucked into the corner of an emerald green lake. She is covered in beautiful tiny streets and cobblestone plazas. She has a promenade with an astonishing view of the radiant lake. Outside of her boundaries are medieval castles nestled in between the ridges of the French alps. The people of Annecy can never frown: anything but a smile is a sin in such a beautiful city. I have been to Annecy three times on separate trips and every time tears stream slowly down my eyes as I approach here familiar streets and canals. I recommend all my readers to go to Annecy if they wish to see the essence of France and the essence of beauty.While in Annecy, I visited the nearby cities of Lyon and Dijon. Dijon (yes that is where they make the mustard) has a distinct feature. It is the product of the beautification projects of Napoleon the Third which brought it the Triumphal Arch, the wide boulevards, and the spacious stores, and a herald of rich Burgundian history. Gothic houses stand side by side with champagne colored residential apartments. As you walk the tiny archaic streets, you may just stumble upon the Palace of the Dukes of Burgundy. The contrast of this regal residence with the minuscule medieval houses only a block away is staggering.And finally, Lyon. The French call it the food capital of France. I like to call it, a better version of Paris. Yes, it is smaller, but that’s a very good thing. There are far fewer tourists, the city is far cleaner, and the experience is so much more authentic. Lyon is sliced into three by the two rivers Rhone and Saone. The middle section of the city has grand plazas like the Place Bellecour and the Place des Jacobins which has a beautiful marble fountain. You can also find some of the most amazing restaurants in France, known as bouchon, on the winding streets. If you happen to stop in one, I recommend you order the Salade Lyonaise, Andouillette, and the Quenelles de Brochet which are all regional favorites. After a hearty dinner, I headed over to the left bank of the Saone where I took a cliff railway to the Basilica of Notre Dame de Fourviere. This is a giant white cathedral that overlooks the entire city and affords a stunning view. Inside the cathedral, you will find a collection of precious mosaics that are laid out with masterful precision and cover every inch of the temple.Although this represents fewer than half of the places I have visited in France, I hope it gives you a glimpse of the beauty of this awe-inspiring nation. The French have an expression, “ Joie De Vivre”, which has no analogous expression in the English language. For me it is the desire to love life. And there is no better way to love your life than to surround yourself with such unadulterated beauty.A page dedicated to the agrarian lifestyle, Jeffersonian Democracy, skeptics, idealists, and love

I guess it’s now almost my second full week of traveling solo through Europe, or really without a set partner or friend.If you need a refresher, I headed out to London on June 19th with my family for a week, then we spent another week traveling around Spain. When they headed home, I met a friend from school in Prague, where we stayed for 2 nights and then headed to Budapest for 3 nights, after which he left.Luckily, I met some amazing people in Prague, and after Budapest, I made the game time decision of booking it to Croatia for a music festival, river rafting, and much needed beach time instead of seeing the final World Cup game in Berlin.When they headed back home to London, I hopped on a bus from Split, Croatia to the Plitvice Lakes, then up to Zagreb for a night. Then through Austria to Rome, where my Italian adventures began. Spent a few nights in Rome and Perugia before heading to Florence for four nights. Now, I’m in Paris for four nights and meeting up with a friend I met in Prague, and his sister.Since I left the people that I was technically traveling with, whether it be my family, friend from school, or the people I met in Prague, I’ve just been catching up with people I’ve met along the way in new cities, making new friends, or exploring on my own. I was lucky enough to be able to extend my trip, so instead of going home on this coming Tuesday, I’ll fly back to the States on August 7th. Yeah, that’s right. I added a week and a half to my solo travels. 😳Before I left, I knew I had about 2 weeks of solo traveling to do. It was a bit scary, really. I have a wild imagination so everything from pick pocketing to Amanda Knox was on my mind.The worst was that whenever I told someone I, a 22 year old female, was traveling alone, it seemed as if they wanted to give me a round of applause and buy me some mace at the same time. They commended how “brave” I was for traveling alone in big, scary Europe.After awhile, it started to piss me off.Did people do this to guys around the same age as well? Wouldn’t you think two girls traveling together could be even more of a target? Am I not smart enough to travel alone?Whatever it was behind their ‘oohs’ and ‘aahs,’ I didn’t like it. I made it through four years in New Orleans without even losing my student ID card or phone and spent a semester abroad where I had many nights walking back from the train/bus station without a friend by my side. Having people constantly give me this response made me second guess the adventure I was about to embark on.I was excited for my 5 and a half weeks (now 7) in Europe! But now I was questioning myself. “Should I have waited for a friend to go with me?” “Will I even come back alive?”Quickly, I shook these thoughts away. Yes, I would come back alive. And no! Don’t wait for anybody. You have the money, you have the time, you have the drive. GO! Screw the people.Not to go all For all the hype around a girl traveling alone, it really hasn’t been that much to fuss about. What is to fuss about is how much you learn about yourself and what you can, and can’t, do.With less than two weeks under my belt as a solo traveller, I already feel mentally and physically stronger than I was before. I know what makes me happy and what doesn’t; however, I am much more likely to give someone or something a second chance just for the hell of it, or because I’m alone and hey, some things are just better shared with another human being.So there’s the rant. Next time you talk to someone traveling alone, ask them questions about where they are going or what they are most excited for. Don’t act surprised about what they are doing based on their age or gender. If someone is going traveling by themselves, they probably have enough guts and wits about them to come back alive.Social Media for Why Travel offers you a wide variety of travel stories from people around the world.

(Hi there, this is a continuation of this post The 1st post was on ideas for meeting Goal #1. This post is dedicated to thoughts on Goal #2.)Dear Airbnb,Let us continue onto Goal #2.Given that hotels are the de facto option for lodging when traveling, it’s hard to not compare our Airbnb experience to those of hotels. If you want to deepen your hospitality angle, there are a few critical features that could really take this experience to the next level.These are the services that I found myself missing over and over again: concierge, bag check, and room service.There is always some anxiety in traveling to unfamiliar regions, especially when you don’t speak the language. One may say that Internet is the new concierge. However, while the Internet has enabled travelers to research and do many of the concierge tasks themselves, there is still no replacing having a human to even point out our subconscious assumptions. That is, the Internet doesn’t solve the problem of you don’t know what you don’t know, and TripAdvisor and Google-translated blogs only tell you so much.Case and point: While staying in Italy, we decided to have a leisurely lunch at a small town one day. We thought…no problem, we’ll walk around, find a place, and kick off a relaxing afternoon with some pizza and cappuccino. What we didn’t realize that small towns in this region shut down for siesta…and when I say shut down, I mean SHUT DOWN. For 1–5PM nothing was open. we had to drive around for a while, in a mild state of panic that we were going to be starving and cranky for the next few hours. Finally we fortunately stumbled onto an open gas station that had some stale croissants.If we had an easy way of connecting with someone that could have given us lunch recommendations or quick feedback on our itinerary, we would’ve found out that we should aim to eat earlier in the morning for these small towns or that everything shut down on Sundays. We could’ve asked our host for recommendations, but she was not around and we didn’t want to bother her constantly on text either.The thing with Airbnb is that there is already a wealth of this information: there are many private messages of this nature being passed between hosts and guests every day. What if Airbnb harnessed this wisdom of this crowd, and took on a model where some of those messages became accessible for all Airbnb users? I recently used a Wordpress theme support forum that worked well in this manner. The support QA were public unless explicitly opted private, and while customer support was solving product issues, answers and solutions became part of a public repository that future users could browse for troubleshooting.This QA repository model for Airbnb would result in better guest experience as guests would have access to fresh and relevant content around activity planning and assistance, while reducing the load on hosts to answer same questions over and over again. Not to mention giving the Airbnb traveler a unique travel planning resource that cannot be found anywhere else.Of course, concierge does more than just provide info. The other critical component of concierge is executing tasks on behalf of the guest, from booking a taxi to making dinner reservations. And beyond that, the hotel generally provides a person that is “on-call” 24–7 to ensure that these tasks go smoothly and to give travelers peace-of-mind with emergency coverage.I faced several situations where this type of coverage would’ve come in handy. Case-and-point: I was flying out of the Naples airport at 7AM, which meant that I had to leave my Airbnb apt at 4AM. My Airbnb hostess called a taxi for me for 4AM, but anxiety abounded. What if cabs were flaky in Naples (wouldn’t be the first city) and it didn’t show up? What if my hostess got the time wrong? What would I do without Internet at that point? Did I want to deal looking into whether I could use Uber here? At this point, my backup plan was to see where the nearest hotel was that I could ask for assistance if something didn’t pan out at 4AM.Fortunately everything went according to plan (the taxi was 10 min early actually). However, if there was a system in which I knew that I could get help 24–7 it would’ve significantly alleviated my worries. A simple mobile-based messaging service where travelers could count on a local person for concierge help at all hours of the day would’ve been very useful in this case.This is presuming that the traveler has wifi or cell reception that works in the foreign country. I personally did not for this trip, but if all these value-add services became available through my smartphone I could see myself springing for a local sim card when traveling.Bag check is a standard service offered at hotels, and now I know why after having gone through its absence. Between check-out times, check-in times, and place transitions, we found ourselves puzzling over what to do with our bags in these transitions. Often we were able to solve this problem by getting a late check-out or early check-in. However, this method was more work for both the guests and hosts in trying manage arrival and departure times and cleanup duties.A bag pickup service where I could control everything through my mobile would’ve been amazing. Through this bag service, someone could come to my location and pick up my luggage, then drops off at another location of my convenience. It didn’t even have to be fully on-demand…only sort of. As long as I could schedule pick-up and drop-off not too far ahead of time, it would’ve fully served my purposes. Not to mention that this is a service that I would glad pay for.This could be an independent, standalone product (startup idea, anyone?). But I mention it here since it seems like a large gap in your hospitality experience, one that you are heavily incentivized to make it happen as it serves your long-term interest. You probably want to own this experience at the end of the day.Whether staying in a 4-star hotel or grungy hostel, the desire to satiate empty bellies at odd hours of the day is a universal need for the traveler. Given that we were dealing with time zone changes, unfamiliar surroundings, and foreign languages miscommunications, doing fruitless Internet researches or looking up outdated guidebooks to figure out a place to eat when our state had been elevated to being hangry was the last thing we want to do.This could be solved in a lightweight fashion. Given that we, the Airbnb travelers, are more inherently curious and up for exploring our surroundings, even having the hosts always provide some names of restaurants that are open 24–7 or late night nearby would be a great start. If we were to get fancier, one could envision a One could argue that “room service” / “concierge” services are springing up for general cases, like I can’t wait to see what kinds of new innovations you cook up next! In the meantime, keep up the great work.Very Sincerely,EllenCurrently living the #startuplife as a #femalefounder. Previously at 

Short term travel is hectic, exhaustive and requires some planning. But it doesn’t expect you to change your life forever. It’s usually a two week trip that transcends you to another place but brings you back to status quo. Weirdly enough long term travel is quite relaxing, immersive and more open ended. It’s also highly life changing. But it does require you to pack your bags and leave a place mentally and physically. It sounds scary but it’s about taking that first step.10.11.Planning long term travel? Feel free to reach out on twitter: Growth Hacker | Digital Nomad.

Networking is an extremely important skill in today’s world. Whether it’s making friends to hang out with or creating business relationships, your network will prove really beneficial in the long run. But what if you’re in a new country with limited time? Is there a way to connect with influential people and make some friends along the way. Is there a way to speed network your way in 2–3 months in a new country? Ecuador and Colombia have smaller tech communities in comparison to New York (obviously) but within a span of a couple of months, I was able to know some key influencers in the local community and make a ton of friends.Here are a few things that any traveler can do to integrate within the community easily:Have other ideas?

by Tajimi, Japan, July 10, 2015.Lilac is ancient, grey, and dying.I wish I knew what her disease is. Maybe it’s a mix of Alzheimer’s and something else. She is behaving very erratically, and rarely shows any feelings. Eating is all she can think about. When she’s not asleep, she meanders across the room looking for food, spinning in little circles, slowly moving forward until she bumps into something. Or she might get stuck in a corner, unable to go any further. Then she will stand there for ages, looking into the corner with the eyes she has lost. Sometimes I find her like that when I enter the living room. She spends most of the day there. These days, she never leaves the house. It’s probably better that way. You may wonder if she wouldn’t be better off in some nursing home, but she doesn’t belong there.Her life’s mission is search for food — on the floor, in the corners, under the table. It’s no easy task: she lost both her eyes to some disease a few years ago. She is stone-deaf, too. What’s worse, she has these horrible seizures that cause her to fall over and gasp for air. When she is going through these spells, her chest heaves, and her mouth is wide open, tongue hanging out. She falls and thrashes and paddles in the air. Sometimes she manages to get on her feet again and stagger around the room, disoriented, endlessly spinning in circles, still struggling hard to get air in her lungs. She’s drowning. I am quite sure of it. For every breath she takes, fluid builds up in her lungs. The harder she breathes, the faster the buildup. I know. It happened to me once. I know the terror of drowning on dry land, with nowhere to escape. Oh, the panic, the horror! Or maybe it’s different. I can’t tell, for she is unable to communicate complex thoughts.Sometimes I wish Lilac was dead. She lives on the edge of the Void, with no hope for escape, like circling a black hole, closer and closer to the event horizon, destined for annihilation. Sometimes death touches her and she collapses in spasms. She struggles to fill her lungs with air, wheezing, and it is terrible, terrible.When it is over, and she comes to rest, and I have changed her diapers, I wonder at the struggle she puts up when death is touching her. She will not give up without a fight. And I realize I am a happy man. I can breathe, and wonder at the world, and travel.She is sleeping now, in her favourite chair. Her chest is rising and falling slowly, her breath calm and steady. Maybe she is dreaming of the happy days when she was a little toy poodle puppy.I am writing this in July, 2015. Lilac is a late encounter on my path to the East, which has been going on since the beginning of the ’80s. Looking back, the little, ancient dog and her predicament sheds light on my decades on the road. The sight of someone at the end station of life is food for thought. There is no road ahead for Lilac, and no way back.Since I set out, there must have been a thousand times when I have been tempted to give up.In fact, when I started, getting on a train to Israel from Sweden (I was scared of flying), I had no idea where I was going. All I knew was that it was a country very far away. But I just went. Death gave me no choice. For some reason, it has always been present in my mind. I knew I could either stand still and fade into it, or move forward and possibly die quickly. But the fading-away type of death would be more miserable. Every time I was at a crossroads, there was really only one path.A crossroads has been used as a primal symbol since the dawn of civilization, and probably long before it. Looking for some way to explain the East and West, and how they connect to each other, I discovered that these ancient symbols may be one of the best ways to do so. The symbols can serve as excellent illustrations of people, places or concepts — and what good is a travelogue without illustrations? Some of the best symbols I have found are the Take this one, for example:This kanji means “crossroads”. It’s the ancient, original form, a pictograph of straight and crossing roads. Over time, it was streamlined into this shape, which is used today:You can still kind of see the roads from the original form, if you look closely. It has acquired new meanings, too: one of which is “go,” and another “do”. Playing a bit with this idea, you can think of it as: “Just don’t stand there at the crossroads, go and do something!”Says who? Says death!See the little This indicates that the words (from the mouth) are When I think of the kanji for “crossroads” and the one for “death notification”, I see myself at a crossroads, hesitating, and death pushing me ahead. His whisper is silent, but he has Lilac. By touching that little dog and showing her agony at the end station, he reminds me of how inertia is the only thing I cannot afford in this life. It’s an advance notification of my own death. And I step forward, into the unknown. This was how I progressed from West to East over the course of three decades.Stepping into the mist of the unknown may be an act of a Fool. But forever fading away at the edge is even more foolish, for it is a wasteland, a pointless wait for an end that is coming anyway. The unknown is only an illusory void. The real one is death by inertia.This is illustrated well in Western symbolism too, like in the Tarot card that depicts the first step in the Journey of the Fool. While the standard interpretation is that the barking dog tries to stop the Fool from plunging into the emptiness ahead, Lilac, in her agony, is reminding me to keep moving.“I haven’t touched you yet,” says death. “But look what will happens when I do.” And he touches Lilac with a cold, bony finger, just for an instant. “I see your point,” I reply. “To hell with it! Let’s dive into this emptiness and see what happens!” And I took a train from Sweden to a desert in the Middle East. That was in 1980, and I’m still on the road, a bit wiser, but forever a Fool.OR, why not skip ahead and join my mailing list right away?A place to leave your mark in the sand if you have a strange travel story to tell — especially from Asia.

As I approach the tenth month of working on my own business, I have found the need to remind myself very often about why I decided to build a travel engine in the first place. You see, in order to create To say that I’m obsessed with travel and software is an understatement. Let me give you an example of the first one. During the 90’s I worked as a sales representative in travel agencies, wholesalers and airlines. One fact about the travel industry, at least in Mexico where I was born, is that the salaries across the industry are terrible. I’m not going to get into details about income for agents but believe me it was bad. The few incentives that kept me going for years were the free travel every now and then, the strong connections I built with fellow agents and the sincere thankful smile of satisfied customers. Some of those clients used to come back to my office just to share their travel stories. That was truly an incentive. I have to add that living in an apartment owned by my parents, which meant free rent for me, was extremely helpful too. Cheers to the parents!In those early days of the internet, at least in Mexico, software and web development were as unreachable as life on Mars currently is. Note that I’m talking about poor and medium class kids. Of course, the possibilities increased tremendously if you had rich parents, a computer and a strong desire to learn the mysterious ways of coding. At that time, I only had a strong curiosity for the internet but nevertheless a strong and lasting one.Now let’s fast forward to 2005 and my humble beginnings on the art of web development. Many years of miserable pay and unreasonable poor decisions led me to one good move: Get myself signed up for college after 15+ years of putting that decision off. That first elective class of HTML totally transformed my life and opened a universe of possibilities. It was the mythical aha moment when I knew I would devote myself to understanding the bells and whistles of those fascinating pages that we digest every day on the internet and make us laugh, share, feel and sometimes cry.Don’t get me wrong, after many years of learning several languages that make up those pages I still don’t consider myself a master of the art of coding. Maybe the secret of my fascination with web development is that there is always something new to learn. It evolves so fast that it is almost impossible to keep up with. I have to confess that sometimes I can’t help myself but hit F12 when I stumble upon a smart and beautiful site. For those less geeky, the F12 key lets you look into the HTML code of the page.Upon graduation I was lucky to have a job lined up in one of the biggest corporations with offices all over the world. I remember feeling so proud to be able to receive a decent salary for once. At the time, I thought that the job would satisfy my hunger for learning and fulfillment too but I was so wrong. The following might sound odd but after only three days on that job I realized I needed to plan an escape from the corporate world. I know what are you going to say, too soon to jump to conclusions? Yes, that was my thought too. Anyhow, the escape took me five years. Most of the time I kept reminding myself about all the benefits of the job: financial stability, insurance, learning, friends at work, gym benefits, etcetera. I didn’t realize until the last year working there that at the end of the day it all boiled down to one single thing: fear.Perhaps reading all those books of entrepreneurship, the articles on Inc or maybe the great quote of Henry Ford (see below) made me overcome my fear and finally made the decision.Now, don’t think I drank a Tequila shot to be able to jump off that bridge. During those years I tried several times to write plans for a business of my own. I even built (with some help) an Android app for bar hoping in Houston. I’m not going to list all of the different businesses I thought I could create but I will tell you that there were many. The problem I usually encountered was that most of those great ideas weren’t aligned with my lifestyle, knowledge, technical background and most importantly I couldn’t see myself working on them the rest of my life. Until…it clicked!Tony Robbins was right. Better questions have better answers and inevitably lead to better results. I love this guy. Even in the moments when you feel like nothing is going to work, somehow Tony manages to pump you up and get you ready to kick-ass. Anyway, the point is that one day, I asked myself: What is the business that you see yourself working on for the rest of your life? Will the business provide fulfillment, connection, contribution and at the same time will you enjoy it? Will the business align with your lifestyle, knowledge or obsessions? Once I was able to answer these questions it all started to get clear. I was able to focus and to work on a plan that was totally compelling to me. The naming of the business was easy although it took me a couple of days of playing with words. It had to involve somehow the word travel, trip or something related. After several tries, one of my domain picks was available and I proceeded to create a simple logo, that in my opinion, represents a person going on an adventure. See the logo below and don’t judge :-).My vision for the business was to create an online travel engine where we will curate meaningful travel experiences. The experiences should build team spirit through activities that mix adventure, nature, culture, and history. Each travel experience involves a bit of fitness with the idea to sync up body, mind and spirit.As you can see, so far it’s been a great and bumpy ride. Making decisions that will affect the course of your life is daunting and scary but I believe those same decisions make us grow. I’m grateful to have people in my life that support my decisions no matter what (cheers to my wife). I could tell you all the great things I have learned during the past months but we will leave those for another post. I can also foresee many challenges in the future but those are the exciting things in life, right? At least, that is what I choose to think. One thing is for sure, I don’t regret the decisions that I have taken in the past. For good or bad they are a compilation of events that led me to where I am now.So here is a thought for you. Open your browser and start typing your next adventure. Come on, don’t tell me you are not dreaming about something. Maybe it is a challenge like running a marathon or skydiving. Perhaps you want try something new (like me writing this post). Probably you are bound to create the next trendy app, you never know. The idea is to get out of your comfort zone and do something. Once you do that, you will be glad you did. I will leave you with another of my favorite quotes:Please feel free to leave a comment or share this post with friends.

Last Oct my husband and I took a 13-day vacation to Japan, included Tokyo, Kyoto, Nara and Osaka. We were so excited to be there, here are my sketches with a lot of fun memories.From Chicago to Tokyo, 15 hours flight. The first day was purely on the flight, but we got a free extra seat and very tasty flight meals, not bad.Typhoon No.8 has left Tokyo, Yeah! Tokyo Tower was very close to our hotel. Out first vending machine experience was in a small restaurant for lunch, very interesting!So many controls on the toilet seat, it has been fun to try every of them. Warm toilet seat should be considered in Chicago too.We went to Shinjuku district at night. The photo booth was very very interesting, we followed the pose guide then the larger eyes and sharper chins have been applied on our faces in the photo automatically.Taking Shinkansen to Kyoto, we bought insane amount of snacks.( it only took 3.5 hours)Kyoto is a very traditional city, so different.There are lots of famous historical sights.The Kaiseki dinning experience was so awesome, I miss that a lot after coming back to Chicago.Took Shinkansen from Kyoto to Osaka. Very tasty Kaiten SushiStayed one day at NARA park, made some deer friends there. Also we had our first ‘ Sit-On-Knee’ dining experience in a traditional restaurant, the most things in the bowl are made by gree tea, so good!We visited the famous church of light, Tadao Ando’s famous work. We were curious why people in Tokyo stand and walk on the left side, but people in Osaka are doing the opposite. And as a MUJI fan, the Cafe  Meal MUJI is another must go spot.Took Shinkansen back to Tokyo. Had amazing salmon onigiri on the train. Then we took a quickly tour to the Roppongi Hills and Kaminarimon.Last day in Tokyo, we just ate as much as we can. Tsukiji fish market is a must go, we found all types of food there, so good!Had our last meal in Japan at airport. Bye bye Japan, you’ve been nice to us. Hope we have chance visit you back!

Italy is a very rich nation. It is rich in culture; it is rich in food; it is rich in history, and it is rich in the innumerable sights which feast any visitor’s eyes. The Italian countryside and cities are a canvas. They encapsulate the millennia which have brought Etruscan, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Norman, and Germanic influence to the fertile valleys and the lofty hills. A center of empire, law, renaissance, and religion, Italy is one of my favorite destinations in Europe.Oh and, I love food. So I’ll tell you about all my favorite Italian dishes. This piece will cover the first half of my travels in Italy, ending with the city which all roads lead to (Rome).One of my favorite regions in Italy is Liguria. It is located in the north and borders the Western Mediterranean Sea. The long coast is covered in sandy beaches and immense cliffs. And even though driving on the narrow dirt roads winding through these cliffs is a nerve-racking experience, the views which open up in the occasional inlets will wipe away any emotions besides awe and joy. If you ever end up in Liguria, Cinque Terre is a must see. Five colorful villages stand on boulders sticking out of the jagged peaks of the Ligurian coast. One of those villages is Corniglia. If you ever end up there, go to “a cantina da Mananan” and try the rabbit in white sauce (or anything, because it’s all probably amazing). For the foodies, Liguria is the birthplace of focaccia which is without a doubt the best kind of bread ever made.The next region I visited in Italy was Tuscany. Everyone has heard of Florence and Siena and how beautiful the two cities are (and believe me, they are), but my favorite part of Tuscany was driving through the endless golden valleys. There is no better way to get a true glimpse and taste of the Tuscan sun than by stopping in a tiny village trattoria (small restaurant) and ordering a local soup or grilled pork dish.However, I cannot leave the birthplace of Michelangelo and Da Vinci without saying a word or two. By far my favorite aspect of Florence is the Duomo: the enormous white and green marble cathedral located in the middle of the city. One of the most satisfying experiences in my life occurred as I walked along the narrow streets of Florence and stumbled upon this titan of a structure looming hundreds of feet over me. I had never felt so small (until I reached the Vatican the next week). And the top of the enormous dome of the cathedral affords a stunning view of the red-roofed city.There are certain people, who upon visiting the greatest cities of Italy, prefer Venice to Rome. God bless their souls. However, for me, Rome is not just a city; it is THE city. Rome is the mother of western civilization and simply standing anywhere in its bounds makes me tremble with excitement. For me, Rome is like Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory for Charlie. I started out with the Saint Peter’s Basilica which is still the greatest man-made structure I have ever seen. The grand ceilings were so tall, that I found myself wondering if heaven might actually be somewhere near them. The rich red and black marble emanated such awesome power and faith that my entire body felt the overpowering spirituality of the shrine. The hundreds of young black-robed priests stood nervously around waiting to begin their lives as the modern missionaries of their faith. Such concentration of religious fervor can only be felt in a few places across the globe, and I stood in the center of one of them.After visiting the heart of Catholicism, I crossed the Tiber river. After enjoying a delicious cappuccino with a variety of Roman pastries I began my trip anew. The wonderful thing about Rome is that as you walk the streets, you may veer off any given trail and stumble upon some new marvel of human genius. That’s pretty much exactly what I did. Glorious plazas opened out of nowhere with white marble fountains spouting emerald water. The moment I crossed the threshold of the Renaissance, the stunning Pantheon transported me back to the Roman times. One block I stood in the times of the Pope Gregory, the next I was surrounded by remnants of the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Finally, I arrived at the famed ancient ruins of Rome. For some the Coliseum and Forum are just good spots for photos, but for me (being the history nerd that I am) they were far more. Even though it was 43 degrees celsius outside (109 fahrenheit), I trudged on in my newly purchased straw hat and inspected all the arches, columns, and ancient baths that came into my view. But don’t worry, as a reward I treated myself to a delicious and refreshing meal of melon, mozzarella and prosciutto followed by some pasta carbonara.A page dedicated to the agrarian lifestyle, Jeffersonian Democracy, skeptics, idealists, and love

I think this is true not only of travel, but also how we live our lives in general.I’m with you on the need to bring slowness back to the world.

When Wilson, our Goldendoodle, diedBecause we like to travel, we wavered every time we considered getting another dog. Wilson had hated the car and stayed with dog sitters whenever we left. Making those arrangements was a hassle we didn’t miss. He was so huge he’d been difficult for me to walk with my gimpy skier’s knee, so I worried how I’d handle another dog. That all changed when my husband suggested we stop at the local animal shelter a few months ago. We hadn’t been for years. When we walked in, we saw a volunteer holding a beautifully marked black and tan terrier mix puppy.Despite my husband’s logical objections, I started filling out an application two seconds later. I reasoned with him that this dog was small. He would be easy to walk. I reminded him that our oldest daughter would be moving home soon to start graduate school, and that our youngest daughter would be home from college all summer. Two months later we brought Arlo home, just as our daughters returned from school. Despite the fresh holes in our yard, training responsibilities and puppy chaos inside and out, we can all agree with Snoopy’s creator, Charles Schultz, who said, “Happiness is a warm puppy.”IN HONOR OF ARLO, Wilson, all our dogs before and dog lovers everywhere, I’ve compiled a list of ways for dog lovers to celebrate canine companionship at home and on the road:Writer/Traveler Time is life. Spend well. Give generously.

You might be wondering, “What’s this ‘Traveler’s Mindset’ thing all about?” Today, I’m going to let you in on the full story.The beginning of The most exciting, exhilarating, adventurous experiences you can have in life are not exclusively for the ultra-wealthy. You can have epic adventures and an adventurous life, too. But before you go looking for adventures around the world, you have to start right where you are. You have to begin with your own state of mind.Developing your Traveler’s Mindset, is THE key to unlocking a life of adventure.How do I know? Well, it worked amazingly well for me.I’ll share how it all happened, and as you read, ‘try on’ my story as if it could be your own. Play with it a little — if you’re in a similar position like I was, it’s my hope that this article will help you take the initial step towards your first international adventure.Four years ago, I left the U.S. I left because I wanted to get out.Out of the Midwest, where I’m from, and out of the country. I’m from Wisconsin, and growing up, my brother and I didn’t have cable television and we weren’t allowed to play video games, so our options were to play outside in blizzards or read a book. (I usually chose books.)One of the first books I remember reading was a thick book of Greek mythology. My father gave it to me when I was about 7 and I’m pretty sure his thought process was something like, “Buffy the Vampire Slayer? No, no — that’s way too violent, way too scandalous. I’d better have her read Greek mythology instead.”Though it wasn’t much less violent than vampires, that book of mythology made me curious. It made me want something different than the American dream…Something other than the big house and the nice car.It was stuck in my mind: I wanted adventure. New discoveries in far-off lands, exhilaration…you know what I’m talking about — maybe you’ve experienced that desire for adventure, too?But maybe you’re hesitant to travel, especially abroad.Recently, I got curious about the numbers. I had a feeling that not too many Americans traveled outside the country, but was it really an issue? So I googled it (of course). According to the esteemed folks at the Census Bureau, as of June 2015, I wondered, why? Friends who really wanted to travel would ask me how I did it, and I would ask them what was holding them back.The same two reasons always came up:Do those reasons sound familiar?If they do, I wonder, if you take an honest look at yourself, are time and money the only things holding you back? I’m willing to bet that they aren’t.Today, I’m calling you out.Maybe you’re scared. Maybe you’re afraid of the unknown. I think you might be…because I was.I wasn’t a traveler; I didn’t have a traveler’s mindset. And I’m writing this to convince you today that having a traveler’s mindset is the key to having adventures everyday, to connecting with exciting people around you right where you are, and to living a life on fire.At the age of 14 my parents put me on a plane alone and shipped me off to Munich, Germany. I was more than nervous. I couldn’t sleep the night before the flight, and I was physically shaking as I walked onto the plane. I barely knew the relatives I would spend a month with. I had no idea what lay ahead. I arrived in Germany, met my relatives, and I found that “thank you” and “Gesundheit” could only get me so far in communication.But we found ways around it, mostly through smiling, doing charades, and sharing food — classic ways that people of different cultures connect. They made me feel accepted, and it was exciting.Then my travels took me to new places. Late one night, near a town on Lake Garda in northern Italy, my cousins, their friends and I were biking down the mountain. (And for me at age 14, to go out alone at night in Milwaukee without parental supervision was unheard of…) We were on our way to the nearest gelato stand for the best Italian ice cream, I was riding on the back of my friend’s bike, and I looked up and saw all the stars…I felt so connected — to the world around me, to my friend, to living life to the fullest, to that exhilarating moment. So I let go of my friend’s waist, I put my hands up, she kept pedaling and we coasted down that tiny, Italian road…with the breeze, and the stars, and the smell of the lake.I realized, “Wow, I had become a traveler. I realized that I could have those adventures, too.From that point on, I was hooked. I knew that I wanted to create a life in Europe and see new places. And it was that deep curiosity that led me to learn languages, so I studied German, French and Italian.Now I know you might be thinking, “Well, that’s all great, but I don’t speak any other languages and I really don’t have the money to travel.”Well, what’s interesting is that back then, my languages weren’t that good, and I didn’t really have much money either…so I looked for opportunities.I applied for the Fulbright grant and was paid to fly to Germany and teach English for a year in a town of 10,000 people.I worked full-time in a communications job in Frankfurt and during those two years I went all over, couchsurfing in dozens of cities across Europe for free. And I didn’t stop there. I went as far as New Zealand and Southeast Asia, and before I knew it, I had traveled to 25 countries.Somewhere along the way, I actually found myself feeling apprehensive. I had this fear of returning home to the U.S.By then, to me, the United States was a place of routine, where people were workaholics who only cared about their paychecks, and where all people talked about was the latest episode of whatever Netflix show was popular.I was afraid that after 3 years and 25 countries and enough exhilarating memories to last a lifetime that I would get back, and all the adventures would be lost.You probably know what I’m talking about… We come back from a week vacation and all of a sudden we’re back in a rut. We settle back into our routines, we complain about the things we’ve always complained about: our jobs, the government, the weather…Not only that, but we compare the memory of that vacation — the newness, the excitement, the discovery — to our routine and feel even worse about our everyday lives.So I started thinking, “How can I find a way to stay in this frame of mind?” (Stay with me on this one…) What if, instead of feeling disappointed or unmotivated after we get back from a trip, we could actually feel even more energized and ready to take on new challenges and adventures in our hometowns?And what if, instead of feeling isolated or anonymous, we had the tools to connect and engage with people around us, not only abroad?I thought back to my travels. Back to when I felt scared and helpless — like one time when I was alone in a cab in Bangkok, Thailand at night.My taxi driver stopped the car in an alleyway, got out, and started talking to the only people on the streets — men — while I waited nervously in the car…thinking that I’d be kidnapped…When I felt scared and helpless, I asked myself: And…What was it about the borders in my mind that I had constructed that made me suspect the driver didn’t have my best interests at heart?Where did my suspicion come from? Where did my fear come from?Turns out, the taxi driver was simply asking those men for directions.I thought back to when I felt stupid (it happens a lot when I travel) — like that time I took a metro ride miles in the wrong direction, out to a suburb of Paris…I asked myself: Even though I felt stupid, I turned to the man next to me and asked about ways to get back into the city. One simple question turned into a whole conversation full of curiosity about my hometown, Milwaukee, and Cameroon, where he was born.Instead of feeling frustrated that I had gone the wrong way and wasted time, I stepped out of the train with a smile on my face, new knowledge in my head, and gratitude for that real, human connection.See, at home, we start thinking that there’s some sort of rule. It’s a rule that I think keeps us from connecting with the people around us. It’s not the traveler’s mindset. We start thinking, “this is how I see the world” or “this is just what I always do”.There’s a stranger near you, right now. If you’re at home, or at work, there’s someone you don’t know within a hundred feet from you.That’s a person — a human being — with a whole slew of life experiences, with skill sets that you can learn from and grow from…and they can learn and grow from you too.All you have to do is start the conversation.If that sounds scary, don’t worry. You still have a few seconds before I’m going to ask you to do exactly that…Now, I’m not that kid anymore who felt confined to the adventures of a Greek mythology book. I’m a world traveler with my own passport to adventure.The best part? I’m never bored, because I know that the next interesting person, the next amazing connection is just a conversation away.And you and I? We’re not confined to getting a rush from what we see on movie theater screens, or in video games or at amusement parks.Happiness, real connection, and adventure is all right where we are.We can seek out opportunities to be more open, to be more curious, and to have the courage to shatter boundaries that separate us from the people around us, right in our own hometowns.When the next stranger crosses your path today, after you finish reading this post, ask them the first meaningful question that comes to mind. It could be as simple as, “If you could do anything without time or money as obstacles, what would it be?”Feel a little scared? Or maybe…you feel stupid doing that?That’s ok.You can choose openness. Choose curiosity. Choose a more borderless mindset.Choose Coach  Publisher. Adventure Enthusiast. Dancer. Traveler. Optimist. 

We will visit Juneau  Glacier Bay National Park in this post. Both these locations in Alaska are Travelers Paradise  must visit once in your lifetime. I have had the privilege to visit this beautiful part of the Globe for 6 years consecutive years  would like to share some of my first hand experience on my visits here. Alaska is a paradise on Earth which once belonged to Russia  was purchased by United States in 1867 for $ 7.2 Million (a cheap bargain for a fact that Alaska is filled with hordes of Natural Resources  amazing Fauna and Flora.Some 30,000 people live in Juneau. Its total area makes it one of the biggest towns, in size, in the world. Only Kiruna, Sweden, and Sitka, Alaska, exceed Juneau’s 3,248 square miles. Today Juneau is famous not only for gold and government but also for its breathtakingly beautiful glaciers and stunning views of both water and mountains. Juneau is not accessible by roads (Primary Access by Sea  Air). Downtown Juneau sits at Sea below steep mountains of about 4,000 feet. Atop these mountains in the Juneau Icefield which houses close to 30 Glaciers  is the home to the World Famous Mendenhall Glacier.Major Points of Attraction in Juneau:-You can book independent Whale Watching Excursions with several tour operators, i.e. Dolphin Jet Boat Tours, Best Damn Charters, or on Scania with Capt. Jack to name a few. Be sure to bring a warm jacket and take advantage of the topside observation deck. If conditions allow, an underwater hydrophone is deployed for a chance to hear the humpbacks’ incredible “singing.”Other places to visit in Juneau would be taking a Tram Ride from the pier to Mt. Robert, visit the historic remains of the Alaska Gastineau Mills, visit Gold Creek  try your hand at Gold Panning and receive a Gold Claim Certificate as Momemto, visit the famous Taku Lodge where the float plane lands in front of the Taku Lodge directly across the river from the Hole-in-the-Wall Glacier. The more adventurous type can go biking, Zip-line Canopy Adventure, White Water Rafting on Mendenhall River, Mendenhall Glacier Canoe, Sea Kayaking or on a Helicopter Tour.Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve is a United States National Park and Preserve in the Alaska Panhandle. Just west of Juneau, this breathtaking national park and preserve boasts some of the world’s most spectacular tidewater glaciers, such as Margerie Glacier, which often drops colossal chunks of ice into the sea. Not surprisingly, Glacier Bay National Park and its epic ice giants are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site comprising Alaska’s magnificent park system.There are nearly 15 tidewater Glaciers in the Park. About 75% of the visitors arrive on Cruise Ships which spends the entire day on a scenic cruise in the park. The Park Rangers will join the ship to share their knowledge of this amazing place and host a fun Junior Ranger program for kids. They may even be able to help you identify Glacier Bay’s abundant wildlife, including humpback whales, sea otters, porpoises, harbor seals, black-bears, mountain goats, bald eagles and large colonies of seabirds. Take in the awe inspiring scenery as you enjoy an unforgettable day of sailing through this dazzling park, where you’ll glide along emerald waters and past calving icebergs, and can breathe in the crisp, fresh air to your heart’s content.In -park accommodations are available at the Glacier Park Lodge, along with activities such as Trekking, Kayaking, Rafting, Fishing etc. One of the most beautiful  serene places on Earth with an abundance of Wild Life.Globetrotter | Cricketer | Sachin Tendulkar Fan | Avid Reader | Happy Go Lucky Aquarian | Sagacious | Ex-Purser | Travel  Shore Excursion Professional

Gone are the days when travelers had to stop someone on the street just to find a decent place to eat.Along came Google, then Trip Adviser, then Yelp… Soon thereafter- there are zillion websites and online apps handing you the world on a silver platter.Granted, there are some things that are still better answered by individuals rather than searching for it on line. Yet no matter how powerful Google search is — we still tend to ask the same tired questions on Social Media instead of just searching the internet.Here are my top 12 True, you could ask that on Facebook and probably even get an answer.If I answered no, would you STILL buy a flight ticket, go all the way to Sydney only to HAVE THEM PLACE YOU on the next flight back, ALL because you listened to Mr. ME ?A good place to start would be this Well then, I’m so happy you asked for TOP recommendations and not just ANY recommendation.

I traveled from Philly to Los Angeles (and then back again two weeks later *sobs*) a little over 10 years ago and I was hallucinating by the end of my 3-day ordeal from lack of sleep. I swear to god — hallucinating. I couldn’t stand being upright in my stupid seat anymore and just laid on the floor of the sightseer car on the last night. It was not my proudest moment.

by I never consider buying flight tickets before I check out Skyscanner first. Skyscanner is the holy grail when it comes to finding the cheapest airline tickets. The website works by searching all online travel booking companies and compiles them into a list. You then get to filter those choices in order of pricing, time, etc.In addition to the website, the phone app is also useful. It delivers the ability to add flight tickets into a watchlist folder so that you can receive updates if your plane ticket rises in value.Cost: FREEIf you are unfamiliar with or haven’t heard of Airbnb, then you need to get on with it before you miss an excellent opportunity. I have never been a big fan of hotels or places in general where tourists accumulate. Airbnb is a great way to escape from the norm and to learn more about your area. It’s also one of the best ways to make friends and chat with the locals.Airbnb works by giving tenants the option of putting their space online for users to rent out. This gives you many options to choose from including many options that are inexpensive.What’s useful here are the reviews.

The world of business travel is an often ignored sector when it comes to travel blogging but just because your trip is covered doesn’t mean you don’t want to have some control over the experience. With these travel tech gadgets, tools and apps a business traveler can turn a trip from simply business to a truly worthwhile and enjoyable experience.There’s nothing worse than walking through a massive airport looking for the one available outlet, finding it, plugging in and realizing it doesn’t work. Save yourself the time and the effort by packing a USB battery pack into your carry on. It’s a handy tool when you’re in a pinch!You’ve got your iPhone. It’s been able to optimize your working experience for the most part during domestic projects but is it unlocked? If it isn’t you could get charged ridiculous roaming fees if you aren’t able to switch out your SIM. An unlocked phone allows you to avoid additional expenses unless you’re lucky enough to be on a carrier that doesn’t charge obnoxious roaming charges.If you’re a veteran business traveler, you most likely own a pair of these already. However, these are ubiquitous because of their usefulness. No list of travel tech would be complete without them.

Travel can be one of the most transformative experiences of your life. Don’t miss out on the chance of a lifetime. You never know what will come along. All of the above could happen. Many are likely. Some are guaranteed (But you won’t.Let me guess… Your — Speculative, often (ir)rational armchair philosophy and pragmatic life tips.

Last year, One of the first reactions I received when I told everyone what I was doing, was fear for my well being. Actually, quite the opposite is true. And they want your money. Or they want your time. Or they want your skills. I learned this on Day 1 of my first trip in New Delhi (I hated that city for this reason). I was with a Well, as we walked, an Indian man joined our group and started to ask simple questions. He wanted to know how I knew my Korean friend. He then told me not to trust him — not to trust anyone — that the city was dangerous and that I should go with him instead. At the same time, another Indian man did the same thing with San Am — that I should not be trusted, that he knew the way to the place he wanted to go. But then more Indians kept coming. And they started to fight with the first Indians, and they all tried to pull us apart from one another. Oh yeah, all this To escape, San Am and I essentially had to cause a loud(er) commotion to draw more attention. That was about the worst of my bad experiences traveling through India.Thus, people are generally good. Or maybe I just got lucky.There are different strategies to attaining that thing you want. One approach is to pre-plan everything. Do the research online, book the hotels online, book the train tickets online, read up, read up, read up, pay and go.I did that for my first trip to India and spent roughly $5,000 total on a 3-week trip: 1 international return flight, 2 domestic flights, busses and train tickets, But when I got there, I realized I had been ripped off. Tremendously.Some ashrams are free. I could have gotten a room for $4/night instead of $20/night and stayed longer. The places I found online were inflated in price so badly for the people who were like me: afraid of the great unknown.The end of that trip ended triumphantly though — I did not go home upset about the money I spent — it was money well spent. That was the catalyst for my 1-year trip.My 1-year trip cost me roughly $18,000 (for reals). But it wasn’t glamorous at all! I was not living in luxury or by my usual standards. But that’s the price I paid!It was an experiment — to see how little money I could survive on out in the wild. My cheapest experiences happened to be in Nepal. I managed to live in Nepal on $10/day when I wasn’t doing much of anything.You have to decide for yourself what type of lifestyle you can or cannot live without. That is up to you alone. I may have been “poor”, but I always had my own room. And now I have friends all over the world and stories to tell. Well, I value that way more than money or an infinity pool in my backyard.Thus, where there is a will, there’s a way. Figure out what you want.I wish I could tell you it’s all cracked up to be.Ok fine — that’s a lie — it’s 100% everything you think it’s going to be and then 100% more. It’s amazing! Do it! Seriously, do it!You’ll meet the most incredibly courageous, bold, wild people you could ever dream of. You’ll experience sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches that you wouldn’t be able to even start understanding until you go. If you’re really brave, you’ll go out of your way to ensure you’re not checking into a place with all of the comforts of home — (I just told you this) so that you can experience the real thing.Those memories and stories will stay with you forever. And no one can ever take those away.Your problems do not go away. Instead, you are welcomed with a different set of problems. Only now they’re in different languages, and with different rules. And once you start running, you have to keep running.What am I talking about? Let’s start with a roof over your head. The first thing you look for when you enter a city (or country) is a roof over your head. You decide if it’s pre-arranged or not, or you take the risk. Once you know where you’re sleeping, you can chill, and enjoy everything the city (or country) has to offer. That’s when life is good.When does it get tough? When you want to stay longer, but can’t decide if you want to commit. Visas are a real pain in the ass. Governments make it extremely difficult for people to stay longer — and you’ll pay for it via a shitty interface and long lines. Or — you have some money and you’ll pay the $40 to have it outsourced so you can have your day back (which is what I did in Nepal. The point is, these pains exist in our own countries and cities too!Thus, you cannot escape it all. You’ve simply changed your environment.Traveling solo is one of the most freeing experiences you’ll ever have. You’ll be completely, utterly, 100% independent. Just you vs. the world.But you’ll get lonely, which is why you’ll join others along the way. And it’s amazing! You’ll share wonderful moments together: playing games, drinking beers, shooting pool, swinging in hammocks, whatever you’re into.And when you want to stay in Udaipur and they have to move onto Pushkar, cool! You say farewell, you exchange emails, Facebook, whatever, and then you part ways. What’s interesting then is how (or if) the friendship continues to evolve online, over borders, through timezones. I can say that I have true friends all over the world now.Warning—it’s about to get a little heavy.I was hanging out in Chiang Mai, working on an app design, and started to get messages from my mom (totally normal, she wanted to make sure I was alive). Anyway, within 12 hours, the news was that my Within 36 hours, I flew from Chiang Mai to Detroit, with just enough time to buy some black shoes for my dress and stand up for the funeral (thank you World Nomads — make sure you have good travel insurance).I did not make this news public at all. I didn’t have time to process any of it. But what I did do, out of respect for her, was sent a message to all of my friends who had known her — who may have been in the area — and let them know the news.The ones who showed up did not surprise me at all. But the number of condolences I did not receive was one of the biggest wake up calls to date.Thus, you learn who your true friends are. And when you know, you hang on to them.Whew, well it’s been a long article so far. And it was a long trip — going to all of those places, learning all of these languages, meeting all those people, going through constant change. It’s been fun!But it’s also been extremely tiring. And, I don’t know about you, but when I’m tired, I just want to go home.But you need to learn that home is where the heart is. It’s not (entirely) a physical place. It’s a state of mind, and it’s where you decide to make it.I’m only writing this one down because it’s what I needed to understand at the end of my trip. When it’s all said and done, you’ve just gone through one of the biggest rides of a lifetime.Give yourself as much time as you need to collect your thoughts, your mood, your things before you jump into the next adventure.I needed four months back in Toronto with my family before I could figure out what the hell it all meant for me.I returned to San Luis Obispo (my real home), four months ago. I’m finally, now, getting over this adventure and getting ready to move onto what’s next (yes, I’m going to be moving (again) — I will never stop moving).And man, I’m so ready for it!creative technologist, leader, and critical thinker 

I breeze through the first few days. Meeting people I love, friends, family. The familiar smell of home-cooked food, the comfort of my room and sleeping on my bed. It makes the transition almost fairytale-like. I am an instant hit at dinner-table conversations, sharing pictures and stories with all those that care to listen. Days go by and so do the weeks.And then it hits me.The inevitable loneliness that one experiences when in a familiar setup starts to seep in. I become reclusive. Almost withdrawn. The routine seems mundane. Splurging on clothes seems dull. I could talk about it but nobody would understand. I still love my friends, my family, and this city, but it starts to feel small and unrelatable. I start longing for the relationships I form along the road. Travelling, especially alone, does something to you that you cannot ever be prepared for. It changes your world forever.The wanderer’s heart is often the most fractured of them all.I start reading and re-reading about the places I want to see. My wallpaper changes to that of an exotic location. And slowly I start to feel the tingle. I gaze at my dusty backpack for slightly longer than usual. I start checking the airlines for offers and discounts. And the lust for a new place is awakened. The feeling that only my next adventure can calm me is cemented in my heart.Travel evokes a sense of aliveness that is unparalleled to anything one has ever experienced.Drinking is the best cure for a hangover, they say. It must be true. For the tell-tale signs are all there. The familiar urge to pull up the map, pick a place, and go on an adventure. Go away, so I can come back a ‘brand new me’.Travel writer. Compulsive wanderer. Dreamer.

As Through trial and error (heaps of research, hard work and way too much coffee), we’ve discovered five secrets to what makes a successful distributed team:Having the right people is the Not everyone is cut out for a remote working lifestyle. Some people might need a bustling and busy environment to be productive themselves. But in order to work remotely, that person must be independent, reliable, constantly improving, frequently communicating and always GSD-ing (getting shit done).We make sure to only hire people who find our values resonate with their personal values! Just because a remote team is without a physical office doesn’t mean we’re lacking. I mean, isn’t this one of the many reasons why the internet is awesome?!There’s been a boom of incredible SAAS and digital tools that enable us to run a tight ship remotely — allowing our team to get things done while communicating tightly and staying organized.Other tools integral to our working life include Out of all the obstacles, this was by far the trickiest. How could a team work together when separated by hours of time difference?This is where we coincidentally stumbled upon And it works surprisingly well! Introducing the 4-hour overlap resulted in a slight deviation off the standard 9-to-5 hours, but it also gave back more flexibility to everyone’s day — why be a zombie downing coffee at 9am when you’re more chipper at 9pm?Working off separate time zones also meant reducing the amount of distractions and “hey-quick-question” shoulder taps (protip: it’s never quick). It’s amazing how much work you can get done when you aren’t frequently interrupted.The ‘right things’ are different for everyone, but having a team united on what the priorities are drives everyone in the same direction. Add in constant communication and hard-work to the equation, and you’ve got a workforce that can conquer any obstacle.Our daily 30-min standup meetings start off with us catching up and bonding. To some this might seem trivial, but above all, we prioritize having an awesome team — which means we also make sure to spend time with each other.The standups end off with us discussing progress and ways to overcome obstacles. As a distributed team, it’s too easy to be lacking camaraderie and to sweep problems under the rug. Being aware of this, we take extra care to share every person’s successes and obstacles — celebrating the good and tackling the bad together.Constant constructive feedback is another thing we prioritize having. To be part of the team, you must be constantly learning and improving. This means being open to constructive feedback. It’s never a matter of egos being hurt, but a matter of improving in every way possible.Everyone at MELEWI lives by the With the right setup and values, trust and collaboration becomes the default.We make sure to work with awesome people, use lightweight processes and tools that help us get stuff done (effectively and efficiently; no thank you to heavy documentation).And most importantly, we work together for the same purpose — Interested in collaborating with us?

I was looking at the departures at New York’s famous Penn Station, focusing on Poughkeepsie and remembering the episode of CEO of 

It’s cheaper to travel than live in a city like San Francisco. As sad as that may sound like, that feels a little liberating to me. Whether you have some time or are afraid to take the leap into planning a trip, I want to be able to help you achieve this. This article is not about the benefits of travel and it’s importance. There’s tons of information out there from wiser guys than me. No, this is about providing valuable What is the biggest cost to any trip? The flights! In my case, I will be traveling to 13 different cities within Europe and flying to each one. How much do you think these flights will cost? $1500? $2000? Ok maybe $1000? I was able to score these tickets for less than the price of an iPhone! Only $400. How? Low cost carriers but we will get into that a little later.Before we get ahead of ourselves, we have to figure out how to actually get to Europe. International flights can be expensive and you would expect this to be the biggest expense right? ONLY Now the $200 price tag is misleading. You may have guessed that this was due to airlines mileage and rewards programs. I don’t want the focus of this to be about how you sign up for credit cards, spend a lot of money on them and and transfer those points to airline miles. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that and you can find a great resource to do that Now, we are not using google flights in the traditional sense. Before we get started here are a few ground rules we need to follow. Please note that this is intended for people who live in the United States:So let’s plan our itinerary:1.) on Google flights, select one-way as your option and type in a major city near you. For your example let’s use Los Angeles (LAX) as our departure airport and the date 2 weeks from now (note, weekdays are generally better than weekends for good prices):2.) Scroll down and click on the map, this will be your most powerful tool.3.) You see all possible one way flights departing from LAX for the day visually. Now you can see there is a one way flight to London for $398. If you are ok with that price, go for it! However, you can still find a lower price if you are willing to be more flexible. Click on the red show flights button on the left:4.) The regular calendar view will come up. From here you can see prices for that route for this month and the next month:5.) So if we were to wait another month, you can fly from LA to London for $249! That is a steal considering that it costs an average of $600–700 to fly to Europe. Book it right now! (but make sure to cross check the same flight to see if it’s cheaper somewhere else)I suggest you play around with this process to find a itinerary that suits you. An alternative is to look for cheap routes from your local airport to New York. For example, I found Los Angeles → Denver for $44 then Denver → Dallas for $44 and finally Dallas →New York for $44. This still comes out $2 cheaper than the cheapest direct flight from Los Angeles to New York (and plus you get to see 2 great cities on the way).Thanks to your excellent google flight skills, you have booked cheap flights to get you there and back. Now you have a set amount of time to be in Europe and can begin booking flights between the European cities you want to see. First of all, it’s important to make a list of places you would love to visit. I usually sort them into 2 categories: “must see” and “can live with not seeing”.Believe it or not, you are already equipped with the skills to find flights within Europe. You use the same process to see which cities on the map have cheap routes. Using our London example, when we pull up the map we see a cheap flight to Rome.You can play around with this and set up a solid itinerary. I would love to see what some of you guys come up with. A You can get fares as low as $9. No kidding! How is this even possible? Low cost carriers! There are a bunch of them in Europe and the most notorious is RyanAir. This ultra-cheap airlines based out of Ireland offers a no-frills flight experience. Don’t get me wrong, these flights are just as safe as any other airlines but don’t expect an air hostess to offer you complimentary peanuts and beverages. But there are important tips to go over this way of flying:For more thorough tips on these airlines please read Now you are fully equipped to plan a European travel adventure of your very own! I hope this gets you looking at the endless options on what a trip could look like. Play with the system and reap the benefits!

As someone who advises companies on their brand, I’m always surprised to see large organizations that are disjointed from both a visual and technical standpoint. I am going to focus on the two brands I use the most when traveling, United Airlines  Starwood Hotels.I have been a loyalist of United for a long time. Everyone has their opinion on what the best airline is, and for me it has always been United. I have had some level of elite status with them for the past few years and have suffered through the merger with Continental like everyone else. The brand is continuing to evolve and although they have made significant progress, there is still a long way to go.There is the website, the boarding process, the different seats in the airplanes, the way meal orders are taken, the simple fact that UA employees refer to their Continental counterparts as “Ex-Con’s”. The list goes on-and-on. Let’s focus on WIFI.United is late to the game with installing WIFI in their aircraft, but what’s new. They have selected an interesting pattern for updating WIFI on all of their planes. The first to be completed were the Airbus’ A319  A320, now they have moved onto the Boeing aircraft. What I find fascinating is that they have created completely different user experiences and methodologies for accessing the internet on Airbus and Boeing aircraft. For example, I was heading to Washington DC from Los Angeles and was flying on an A320 that had WIFI. I logged onto unitedwifi.com as instructed and was able to login with my Mileage Plus account and select the $12.99 option for my entire flight. It had my credit card on file and was up and running within a few seconds. Great experience. Now fast forward a couple days to my return leg back to LA. This time, I’m on a Boeing 737–900 that has both DirectTV and WIFI. I logon to unitedwifi.com just like before, but now the experience has changed. There is no way of logging-in to my Mileage Plus account, I have to manually enter my credit card and they charge $3.99 per hour as opposed to a flat fee for internet access.This is the perfect example of how United’s brand is disjointed. It’s ironic that WIFI was installed after the merger, but the end result is the same inconsistent user experience. Create a strategy that can be implemented across the board to achieve the consistency that your customers desire. Oh, and bring back the tulip!!I am a huge fan of SPG. I think their rewards points are some of the most valuable in the travel industry right now. Overall, they do an excellent job of brand continuity through their different hotels. It’s easy to identify the sub brand you are staying at and what to expect while there.About a month ago, there was a data breach of some sort at spg.com. There were widespread reports of individual accounts being compromised and hackers using miles to purchase gift cards and other items. It was recommended that I change my password, which I did. Here is where it gets interesting and the challenge of hiring a 3rd party developers to build different parts of your technology.SPG.com has it’s own rules for password strength which meant that I could create a 30 character password with both symbols and digits for maximum strength. I changed my password online and didn’t think much of it until two weeks later when I was off to stay at a Starwood property. When I attempted to login via the SPG app, I was getting an error code. After a phone call and writing an email to SPG, I was informed that the password I created wouldn’t work on the mobile app because it was too strong. No symbols or special characters are allowed. You see… they subbed-out the work on the app to a 3rd party who didn’t follow the same password rules that was on the SPG website. Starwood’s answer to the problem? Change your password to a less secure one. Yeah… no thanks, I just won’t use the app until it’s fixed. Why The bottom line is that you need to pay attention to detail when leading any brand, but especially consumer-facing ones. The smallest of things can make a huge difference and adversely effect the consumer perception of your company. I’ve heard way too many times, “no one will notice”. Wrong, they will. If you spend the time upfront creating a detailed brand strategy, you will have continuity and the perception of strength in your organization, but most importantly you will have happy customers.Brand Builder | Entrepreneur | Speaker | Dizzy Feet Foundation Board Member | Do-gooder working with ONEHOPE  Good360 | Partner 

Every year over the Labor Day weekend, I put together a five-day whitewater rafting trip on the wild and scenic Rogue River in Southern Oregon. As a former river guide, I know river trips and have all the resources to make this a great adventure to wrap up a long summer of outdoor activities.I take charge of getting the permits, gear and meals for this adventure through one of the planet’s most spectacular canyons. It’s work, but the result is pure fun. As part of the process, everyone has a waterproof bag to pack all the clothes and personal items that need to stay dry. My “black bag” basically packs itself after all these years. The problem this year was that while my bag had everything I wanted on the river, neatly inside, it couldn’t manage to grow the legs necessary to get out to the car and end up on the boat ramp at Grave Creek, where the river trip starts.I get a little distracted in the process of loading out to get on the road for the five-hour drive south to the put in. With four boats, five days of food, and all the camping gear to pack into the transport vehicles, I tend to get preoccupied. No excuse for not taking responsibility for my personal stuff, but historically my highly organized partner and love of my life, who has her own set of things to do, is watching my back and “running sweep” to be sure nothing is left behind. That system failed and my bag was right where I left it when we started loading the boats.I generally start a crisis with a little hissy fit. I throw things, kick gear, slam car doors and create a scene. I’m always reminded how none of this changes the outcome, but it’s a bit of DNA I’ve never been able to mutate. This situation was no different. I tore through the cars and trucks thinking the bag was just hiding and would ultimately be found. No such revelation. I was on the cusp of five days in the elements with only the clothes on my back. No driving back to get the bag. Nobody to call to get it delivered. I was at the mercy of the resources at hand.These are the moments that have the power to rattle one’s psyche to the core. Self-doubt and pity seep in through the cracks in the armor of experience producing a potentially debilitating feedback loop. “If I can’t even remember my bag, how am I supposed to get these boats and people safely down this river?” I muse. The whole memory thing can get a little brittle depending on the circumstance, and when it fails, there is a ripple effect on the other systems that depend on it. I was left standing on the outskirts of hope staring at a huge wall of the despair.Fortunately, we all learn to compensate, one way or another. I was going down the Rogue if I had to do it naked and afraid. Of course, I should mention that my “wet bag” did make it into the car. That would be the gear, like my wetsuit, flip flops, and rain pants that could get wet. No toothbrush or personal hygiene stuff, but the sleeping equipment was all in the group gear so I did have a tent, sleeping bag and pad. My pillow even made it, which is always a luxury on these trips with the limits on dry space. Things could have been worse.The same genetics that were producing my memory loss also produced my youngest son, who wears the same size clothes as me. It was looking like the initial suffer-fest I was imagining while camping off-river had dissipated. The sun was out, the water level was up and my boat was actually lighter without my forgotten black bag. The trip, all of a sudden, got easier.The first night camping on the river, I found myself taking great pains in avoiding any activity that would soil or compromise my meager wardrobe. No mustard dripping on my mustard-colored long pants out of principle. No blind-drunk falling down on the way to the toilet in the dark. No shortage of fun, but with the goal of staying comfortable for the whole trip. There was a new challenge to this river. After years of making it all seem rather pedestrian, the river would provide a backdrop for my minimalistic pursuit of comfort. It would also force me to think about what was important and what, really, wasn’t.Having a strong, experienced group of river runners is a great foundation for the problem solving process in the wilderness. Because everyone else prepared, my lack of preparation was easy to back and fill on. Having someone the same size doesn’t hurt, either. And my dear wife and adventure partner still carries her Girl Scout attitude into every travel jaunt. “Be prepared” has never meant more to me as a quality. The whole cohort came, not only well prepared, but prepared to innovate their way out of any roadblock that might arise. This all adds to the trickle of happiness that was building each day on the water, like the tiny feeder creeks and streams that make the Rogue a powerful and legendary force.My resources were tested. Weather shifted from hot and sunny to cold and rainy. Wind on the water combining with the rapids stirred up potential bone chilling moments. For the most part, I was too warm! In terms of comfort, the combination of the lightweight “hydroskin” along with comfortably undersized outerwear made boating a breeze. I did look completely ridiculous at times. Being in the middle of nowhere reduced my need for a fashion statement. I am a bit of a gearhead. I collect gear that produces the greatest return on functionality for the lightest weight and heaviest wear. It’s my security blanket, and without my collection I thought I’d might lose my way in finding comfort. What really happened is the realization that the group was a far more important resource when it came to my well-being. I found my biggest challenge in finding a way to adequately thank them for carrying me through this now-less-than-disastrous oversight. The true beauty of their support was executed effortlessly and I was quickly reminded how it was “no big deal” anytime I tried to draw attention to their sacrifice. Real friends, unlike imaginary, know how to deliver.I did make a point of rotating through my limited stock of garments over the course of the thirty-five river miles. Not wandering around camp stinky and stained would be my contribution to the kindness bestowed. It’s amazing how good something looks after five days of eating, drinking and all-out partying. Never had to worry about drifting too far from the cleanliness/godliness equation. I had a measureable lightness of being I thought might be hard to give up. What if I could figure out a way to live like this out in the civilized world? How hard could it be?Reaching the take out boat ramp at Foster Bar on Labor Day afternoon produces a sense of finality, of conclusion that is difficult to accept. There is talk of packing everything up, driving back to the put in after a resupply, and doing it all again. But there are people to see and things to do, so the consolidation begins and gear is packed. There was one thing I was acutely aware of pulling the raft out of the water at the end of this journey.Surveying the piles of equipment necessary to make a trip down the Rogue such a huge success, I realized I could do a whole lot more with a whole lot less. And that’s really the river I need to row moving forward. Power and freedom are the byproducts efficiency and minimal impact, and I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t benefit from a little more of each in their daily lives.

The quote above derives from the book One of the first thoughts that come to mind when you start to analyse the technical aspects of leaving your workplace in favour of working remotely is the communication problem. First, you think that if you’re not in the office eight hours a day, from 9 am to 5 pm, everything seems impossible to do: you can’t schedule a meeting or make a presentation, it’s hard to talk to people and consult their work, you can’t even sign a piece of paper…I wake up at 10 am; it’s 91⁰F in shadow. When I’m getting a morning ‘cold’ shower, frightened lizards flee in panic in various directions. I get on a scooter and go to grab a fruity breakfast to one of the northern beaches 12 miles away from where I stay. On the island you not only have to consider the left-hand traffic, but also dogs and monkeys appearing out of nowhere on the road, as well as buckets of icy water splashed straight in your face by overjoyed Thai people during the Songkran festival. After the breakfast, a quick coffee on the route back, a game of ping-pong with the natives and a circuitous return route to a tropical office with hard chairs that become soft under the influence of wonderful views!During my stay in Asia I worked in many places, but spent most of the time in the reception/restaurant of the Green Peace Bungalows, armed with a 10 Mb/s internet connection with two access points, and a 3G hot-spot indispensable in the event of a crash. However, an undoubted advantage of working on an island is the quick access to the ocean, jungle, fresh fruits and the overall atmosphere of tranquillity characteristic for a tropical island.I began my journey from What complications did I find during my journey to South-East Asia?The most fundamental need. While the average connection speed is sufficient to work, then with considerable occupancy (especially in the area of the Full Moon Party) I used to have problems with the quality of Skype calls. Luckily, there was a co-working space in Koh Phangan, where I used to come to take advantage of a 17 Mb/s connection. It’s worth to know that you can find such places in all the major cities in Thailand. Thus, in general, I had no reason to complain.There is nothing you can do to handle it. Electricity went out for a whole day during the Songkran holidays, when almost no one worked. A 3G connection does the job only until your phone and laptop batteries don’t discharge. Such situation occurred twice on Koh Phangan and once in Kuala Lumpur.Thai people are rather weak in terms of speaking foreign languages. To communicate with Farangs (which is a Thai name for all visitors from the Western world) they use a non-grammatical mixture of words, which I call This isn’t a problem, actually. AirAsia flies virtually anywhere within the region for very little money, and the comfort level of night trains both in Thailand and in Malaysia is quite good.In case you’re planning to stay for longer, you should remember about your visas — for EU citizens the right to stay without a visa in Malaysia is valid for a period of 90 days, and in Thailand only for 30 days. To stay for more time you just have to leave the country before your visa expires and then come back to reset the conditions of stay — entering the country by land we receive the right to stay for 14 days and when coming by plane — for 30 days.You can argue with the above quote more or less intensively, but one thing is certain: the popularity of the remote model of working will constantly gain popularity in accordance with the development of technologies. In my opinion, this method is at least as effective as or even more than traditional office work, but you’ll learn it only if you take the challenge of working remotely yourself.historian of art  curator | art  design editor 

Anticipation, excitement, and a hint of sadness filled the thick Georgia air yesterday morning. The day was finally here: May 12, 2015. My eyes popped opened several minutes before the 5AM alarm.“We need to track attrition and retention KPIs. Let me go update the spreadsheet. Oh yeah, I need to buy some dryer sheets and put more plastic bags in my luggage. I hope I didn’t forget anything. Crap, I can’t believe I’m saying goodbye to my family in 2 hours.”Usually nights leading up to any extended trip are stress-filled all-nighters that involve little preparation and a lot of last-minute scrambling. Not this time. This morning felt different. It was the start of a new chapter; a chapter that was outlined many years before.I threw my new internal-frame backpack (aka I’m a legit world traveler now) and my Timbuk2 bag into the backseat of my car. Saying goodbye to Lucy was heartbreaking, not only because she knows this isn’t a 2 week trip, but also because 2008 was the last time I left her for more than a few weeks. Layla, bless her heart, didn’t have a clue. Sean took me to work at Tech Square, we had an emotional goodbye, and he left. 😥I flew Southwest to Fort Lauderdale, took an Uber to Miami International, hopped on a plane to Mexico City, and, after a four hour layover, boarded a plane to Rio de Janiero, Brazil. I’m flying into Rio a day earlier than Amelia. It is our first trip abroad together.

When I told people I was travelling to Poland, the negative responses came pouring in. I could forget sampling the local cuisine. There’d be nothing except bread and butter for me. I was going to starve if I didn’t eat meat!Turns out, all those people were wrong.What many people don’t know about Poland is that they have The lamest thing for a vegetarian is hearing that there’s plenty of… salad. While traditional Polish salads are so much better than the limp lettuce affair that goes on elsewhere in the world, there’s plenty of other Polish specialities for vegetarians to tuck in to. The most famous Polish food is The first thing any vegetarian travelling to Poland ought to know if that, believe it or not, there are actually vegetarian chain restaurants popping up around the country. If you want generous portions of hot, reliable vegetarian grub then these are the places to go. Greenway was my favourite because of its yoghurt milkshakes and heaped servings of stew with buckwheat — and it’s cheap. A slightly more expensive food chain, Bio Way, can also be found around the country.It’s not all fast food for vegetarians in Poland. You can expect to find quirky, hipster cafés and organic stores dotted around here and there. A quick search on HappyCow will pull up all the veggie joints in the area you’re travelling. Krakow is a real hotspot for vegetarian places, and Glonojad trumps the lot with its Vietnamese condensed milk coffee and vegan oatmeal cookies. If you want something more rock ‘n’ roll then Spoldzielnia Organic Bar in Krakow serves up rice in big red cabbage leaves on record disc place mats.Where there are quirky vegetarian cafés, there are trend setting vegetarians eating in them — and Couchsurfing is the perfect way to meet them. I found that the Polish people were the most generous and welcoming Couchsurfing community I’ve surfed with. Search for vegetarian hosts in the areas where you’re travelling and you’ll be sure to meet someone awesome. Vegetarianism in Poland is still fairly young, so there are a lot of experimental vegetarian cooks around try out new dishes and mixing cuisines.After travelling as a vegetarian in Poland, I was far from starving. This underrated European country is a vegetarian paradise — don’t miss it.Simple, sustainable, socially responsible travel. Charlie is a long-term traveller, freelance writer and house sitter. 

Our plane lands, its tyres screech on tarmac. People unbuckle their seatbelts and it reminds me of the snapping of a turtle’s small mouth.I walk down a long corridor, carpeted. It smells musty, old.I’m home.A sign reads, “Customs.”A man greets me, a falcon perched on his gloved arm, blinders over its eyes, its sharp, golden beak protruding. It cocks its head back and forth as the man gently nuzzles its skull with his knuckles.I wonder if it knows what freedom looks like.The immigration officer calls me forward with a flick of his index finger. He straightens his red and white checkered He greets me back, the edge of his lips slant up — He starts to ask me questions in Arabic. I listen patiently. I don’t understand any of it.He stops mid sentence and flips back to the front of my passport embossed with gold lettering, which reads CANADA.“Mafi Arabiya?” (No Arabic?) He clicks his tongue. “You live Bahrain?”“Yes.”“How long?”“17 years.”“And before?”I hate this part.He squints at my passport, holding it out in front of him as he examines it.“Born in Germany? Why this?” He asks“My father had a business there.”“Your father Arab?”“No.”“Your mother Arab?”“No.”“Then?”“Well..She was born in Uganda. She moved to Canada when she was 10 years old.”He bursts out in laughter; I can see a droplet of spit stain my passport.“Your mother African?” he points his index finger at me mockingly and then presses his thumb to his chest. “My mother English.” Pause. “You look too much Arabiya.” His right hand paints my face in the air; he is nonchalant in his authority.“You Hindi?” It’s a guessing game now.“Indian you mean?” I ask back.“Ah, Hindi!” Affirmation.“Kashmiri.” It’s an automatic reaction. I try to stifle it with an apologetic upswing on the last syllable.“Pakistan Kashmir?”“No.”“India Kashmir?”“Kashmir Kashmir.”“Too much fighting there.”“But it’s still beautiful.”He bows his head, he has a sad smile — knowing, yearning, nostalgic, I can’t tell. I wonder what association he has made — Kashmir? War? The preservation of beauty in a place riddled with conflict? He stamps my passport in two swift movements and throws it back at me.“Mashallah.” (Generally said upon hearing good news)I know it’s their job, but it’s strange to be thrown into a state of disarray on my own doorstep. Bahrain is my home but I will never be Arab. I have a Canadian passport but I have never lived there. I was born in Germany but beyond the first two years of my life, I have never been back. I spent all of my youth in Bahrain but never learned Arabic — instead, my school allowing us to learn any of the Romance languages. Yet, I can read and write Arabic because I was also raised Muslim and thus have studied the Our plane lands, its tyres screech on tarmac. People unbuckle their seatbelts and it reminds me of the clicking of castanets.I walk down a long corridor, glassy walls, grey sky.I’m home.A sign reads, “US Border and Customs.”There’s a stern looking woman in black uniform greeting us, she holds a sniffer dog with floppy ears on a tight leash. It wags its tail furiously.I wonder if it knows what freedom smells like.I walk through the hallway and am directed towards randomly assigned secondary screening. The immigration officer calls me forward with the flick of his index finger.“Where are you coming from?”“Bahrain.”“Where’s that — Turkey?”“The Middle East”“Oh.”He types harder on his keyboard, determinedly, tap tap tap. He takes my suitcase and starts unpacking it.“Near Soddi Arabia?”Uh oh. “Dubai. Near Dubai.”“What do your parents do?”“They have a small family business”“What kinda small business? Like making “small” things?”He picks up a miniature American flag on his desk, demonstratively, and shakes it at me. He laughs hard at his own joke; I see a droplet of spit stain my passport.“What’re you studying?”“Business..”“College.” He softens. “What year are you?”“Just starting my Senior year.”“You ready to be done?”“Not yet.”He bows his head, he has a sad smile — knowing, yearning, nostalgic, I can’t tell. I wonder what association he made — College? Graduation? The brevity of four years flowing into a gap labeled “forever”? He stamps my passport in two swift movements and throws it back at me.“Enjoy it.”I know what I am I ask myself; do I know what freedom feels like? I think; I do.I do.i love the word human

Here in the US, you’d be lucky to get 2 weeks off, and that’s if you even volunteer to take it. We’re almost working ourselves to death by burnout. But what gets me is that when people do decide to ‘vacation’ it becomes a stress-induced nightmare, full of expectations and idealism, and when things don’t go as expected the trip is ‘ruined.’ They can’t get their mind and focus off of how great it is to not be at work, how much they need this ‘vacation,’ and how perfect it needs to be because it may be the only vacation they’ll have this year.Just stop, and pause for a second.Traveling is about you. It has nothing to do with your job, so stop thinking about your job and stop building these expectations of how amazing it needs to be or else you’ve failed and wasted your vacation. Please On our recent trip to Europe, my girlfriend and I decided to drop our expectations and just I think that’s the root of the problem… Why do people set unrealistic What I’m advocating for is what I advocate for life, make sure you create the right mindset. Learn to be flexible, and be open to unforeseen opportunities. Take it easy on yourself. Screw your Instagram/Facebook moments at some tourist trap. Traveling is not an exercise in narcissism. Meet new people, learn about their cultures, eat some weird stuff, take a wrong turn, and laugh about being utterly lost. Don’t ruin your chance to live in the moment with some Lonely Planet Must-Sees. Drop the expectations, do what you want, and embrace the wonders of the road less traveled.I consider myself a successful business owner and entrepreneur. I love being a designer, and a musician on the side. (XenonSupply, CraveLab, Fickle  Flasking)

The most quickest  inexpensive way is to take the MRT (subway). As mentioned above it’s a 45minute ride that costs you $3SGD to get from Changi to the Downtown Core.Obviously you can take a I found it amazing in Chinatown, specifically on/around I stayed at If you’re a baller — stay at the Marina Bay Sands and get access to an Infinity pool. I’m not, so I didnt. It’s in the swankier part of town closer to proper shopping malls…so if that’s your thing…go for it. There are other hotels like this one…but that’s all I have to say about that (*use Forest Gump voice).Hostels are also inexpensive and a great option in SG. They typically run Also known as Hawker Centres, they’re basically a no frills open air food court. Each vendor typically only makes a few dishes with some variations, but they make them really really WELL. They’re also very inexpensive. This is where locals eat, and is a good representation of the culture…meaning it’s a mix of Chinese, Malaysian, Thai, Indian, Muslim and many other cultural groups in Singapore — and there are MANY. Singapore is a truly multicultural city when it comes to Asian backgrounds. Western cultures are not as well represented…but I guess I didn’t need to say that.They atmosphere/ambiance can be off-putting at first if this is your first time out to an actual Asian food market. The key thing here is to follow the locals. This is true of any where you eat in the world. If there’s As I’ve said earlier, I spent the majority of my time in and around Chinatown — and actually ate most of my meals at the I didn’t try any fine dinning options in SG. Mostly cuz nothing stood out for me and I wasn’t really looking. Coming to SG is about these Food Centres.There seems to be a strong Korean presence along TgPagar Road as well — just right around the corner from Maxwell Road Food Centre, but most shops seem to open midday-late evening. Good for dinner and drinks with friends and from what I’ve been told represents Authentic Korean food well.That’s all I got for now and will update and add more as it comes to me. Hope this helps you on your travels to Singapore.Partner 

I felt the perceived pressures of the external world slowly collapsing back in on my reality.And it was heavy.So I turned to the creative inspiration I had created to hold me up.I grasped onto the idea and concept of what I wanted to create. And I allowed that lead me through the weight I felt coming from the external world.…a weight I had created out of the perceptions in my mind…And it worked.My team and I were featured in Entrepreneur Magazine. We were publicized in over 50 other publication. We gained over 15,000. All in under 9 months.But the weight I felt was so heavy. I felt trapped.I had created a pattern in my mind that I believed was the “path to success.”And the more I followed that path and repeated the patterns I believed who get me there, the heavier I felt.I kept hearing a voice in my mind saying, “There’s something more. There’s something greater. You can go deeper.”At the time, I had no idea where this would lead me, but I felt called.After graduating college in 3 year and while working on my app company, I found myself in the jungles of Costa Rica with Matt Wilson and a group of entrepreneurial minds with the And the jungle opened my heart to the excitement of new possibilities. It was an opportunity to breaking free from the “entrepreneurial hustle” pattern that my mind created, although at the time I didn’t know this.I was ready to break free. I was ready to experience a new perspective of life.And, as I was leaving, I heard the voice in my head again…it said, “Come back here and write a book.”My body instantly reacted with an intense feeling of excitement.Deep down inside, I had a knowing of what had to happen.And it scared me even more.So I bought a round trip plane ticket for Costa Rica. And I listed my company online for sale.And I went into all the pain, all the sorrow, all the excitement, and all the fear that I felt around what I was doing.I remember one specific instance, as I put my company up for sale, my body reacted in a complete fit. The patterns I had created in my body around the “entrepreneurial hustle” paradigm were struggling, because moving to Costa Rica for 3 months was a complete 180 degree shift.I laid outside and just pour my heart out. I remember telling myself, “I don’t know how this is going to work out. I don’t know what I’m doing. But I trust.”My mom asked me, “What’s wrong, Michael?”I couldn’t answer. I didn’t have an answer. Everything felt wrong. And everything felt right. My mind could not calculate a respond because my body was feeling so much.About one week before Costa Rica, I looked at my bank account and go scared. It was low. And I knew there was no way I could live in Costa Rica for 3 months off the amount in my account.More pressure flooded in. More stories tried to cloud my mind. More pain, fear, doubt, and excitement arose.“Will you be able to do it?”“How will you get the resources?”“Are you going to be able to go?”“Will you sell the company?”It wanted to run and run.And instead of allowing myself to get lost in my thoughts, I opened.I went beyond the thoughts…into the feelings.The deeper I went into the feeling, I more my reality shifted.Three days later, I received an offer on my app company.3 days after that, the sale was complete.Explorer of Consciousness.

Thoughts and musings on one of the holiest places in the world, JerusalemIf you happened to be born an extra terrestrial life form and did not understand religion, Jerusalem would be an incredibly strange place. This city has seen conquerors, zealots, pillagers and many a religious inspiration — some of the most famous people to weave themselves into the fabric of time.If Mount Zion had somehow gone the way of Vesuvius and buried this city under a horrendous cataclysm like Pompeii, it would persevere. It is a testament to either the most admirable or the most stupidly stubborn force that drives people to achieve amazing things: faith.Only here will you see a Hassidic Jew walk through an Arab soukh on his way to the remains of Solomon’s temple, while on his way his shadow will cross many a steeple of churches of various Christian flavours.If there is one thing this place does not lack it’s holiness. But what’s really interesting is how that lives with the practical necessities of the current residents. Via Delarosa is the current name of the way which Jesus Christ walked to his death on Calvary. Along that path today are not just the staples of Christian faith but also a playground where children play, cars driving along the lane and many other signs of real life, as existed before, during and after Christ’s time.The salesmen of the soukhs of the Old City are nowhere near as aggressive as some of the others around the Middle East I have encountered. Occasionally, one will ask a staple question such as “where are you from?”, the genius of which lies in that tourists can’t help but answer, forcing them to pause, at which time the salesman will find a fast segue into how his goods are hand made and will be useful. It is a game they play — the tourists want them there because it lends to the atmosphere, and the soukhs are there to make money, an unspoken partnership that is older than the white walls of this city.It’s true, the trademark smell of fresh spices, brand new clothes and hot stone breathes a little frivolity into the Old City, so that this otherwise impractical toy city can exist. They are the life between the reverance and old rocks. They colour the walk to the holy places that make this real (in a sense) and not just in the imagination of the visitor, who must piece together the former glory of some old ruin’s useful days.Speaking of reverence, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is a truly moving place. Its romanesque walls lead up in the centre to the dome below which not a single block of stone lacks the strange property of divine inspiration and awe. It doesn’t matter if God exists or not, he will speak to you here. Perhaps it is the history of where it stands, upon the burial cave of a carpenter turned messiah, where the miracle of resurrection took place, or the incredible work of mankind to truly bring this earthly location to some kind of metaphysical place just within the periphery of God’s throne.There is also the Western (Wailing) Wall of Solomon’s Temple, a place seemingly in tune with the Jewish sense of belonging and sadness of the past. Indeed, people come here to this day and weep over the ruin of a building torn down and looted by a civilization that has disappeared. There is a certain permanence and persevereness that I believe resonates as a point of pride for each and every Jew when they come to this place, knowing that every group of people that have come to conquer Jerusalem have fallen, from the Babylonians to the Romans and onwards to the Crusaders and Ottomans. No one has ever broken the Jewish spirit and this is what the Wall means. Time and the stubbornness of a mule has allowed this place to rise up again and again, and the covenant of Abraham stays true.But one gets tired of walking around the soukhs in which only the tourists find what they’re not looking for and the mind needs a break from the meaning and purpose of the places and people God has inspired. And for that is the rest of the city just on the other side of the Jaffa or Lion or Zion Gates, with stores, restaurants and places modern people who are living in today’s conveniences live.Except, of course, on the Sabbath, when the city could not be more empty save for those lively arabs in the Old City, still peddling their Creative web developer and technocrat working around the world.

From e-rickshaws to driverless cars, innovations in the field of automobiles are getting bigger and better with time. Vehicles are becoming solar-powered and some may run without fuel. It’s not hard to imagine that we may soon be traveling in a steel tube at speeds of almost 1,200 kmph. Such is the scope in the future of mobility.On the contrary, the field of day-to-day travel is filled with innovations in the way we commute on a regular basis. If you’re living in a metro, you’ll probably relate best with the struggles of daily travel. While taxis and autos have been robbing us from ages with their sky-rocketing fares, the cheaper options are way too uncomfortable to even consider. Practically speaking, from a long time, there has not been even a single viable mode of transport, which is both cheap and comfortable. The road is not smooth (literally), even for those who own a car. The traffic jams are always there to give just the perfect start and end to your day. Travel hassle can really take a toll on your mind and body, and trust me, it’s frustrating. And then came, ride-sharing.In these trying times for daily commuters, ride-sharing is no less than a ray of hope. The idea of ride-sharing is quite smart and simple. Four people travel the same way to work every day. One of them owns a car and drives alone and the other three take different modes of transport such as bus, auto, metro etc. Why should they not travel in the same car instead? The car owner can charge a nominal amount and the rest can enjoy a comfortable ride and generally feel happier in life. And when four individual car owners share a ride instead of driving solo, they do their bit for environment by saving on fuel emissions.Many young companies think it’s a problem waiting for a solution and are coming up with cool apps and services which address the issue in different ways. I recently interned in one such company, Working on the project got me interested in knowing about other similar services and their respective popularity. The more I deep dived into it, the more I realized that sharing a vehicle is no longer such a taboo as it is projected to be. And as far as my own experience goes, it’s the most viable option that one can explore and trust. The best thing about this concept is the number of people you interact with, on your way. My own friend circle has considerably increased since I started using the option, and that is when I consider myself to be an introvert of the highest order. Unlike popular belief, people are usually helping and kind, they would help you with your daily problems, professional queries, personal life and much more. With a clean intent, they won’t even hesitate in offering you an emotional or financial support. I’ve seen all this happening in my own ride-sharing experiences.The crux of the story is that if you’re frustrated with your current travel options and are looking for an alternate, ride-sharing is definitely something you should go for. It will make you more compassionate, helpful and a much sober human-being.STUDENT

Travel is exciting for me, travel is enlightenment for me, it’s my self-actualisation, and it helps me learn and puts so much into perspective for me each and every time. The travel bug at some point definitely bit me in my life, it’s an addiction for me and I simply need a fix often, to travel forever is the dream. However my latest trip the decision was to get away from everything really, to find a new alleyway for myself, and sure as hell it was spontaneous.I wanted to figure out if I could do something else with my life, I’d been working in the nightclub industry for three years at that point and worked my way up throughout that time, and the idea was to start up my own business. I can safely say the business that I went to set-up never materialised, but something greater did — my travel site. My real passion, to express my love of travelling in writing with the hope to inspire at least one other person to travel. I have accomplished that, however I don’t want to stop at just a few people now that I’ve got a taste for it, I want to inspire so many!The decision to travel was both easy and difficult. I had to quit my job, never the easiest decision really. It was a well paid job but I’ve never been too fond of money. I had an emotional struggle with myself but ultimately decided it was time to go do something I wanted for a change. So within 2 weeks I had left my job a nightclub manager and was in Bali. Nonetheless it wasn’t even that simple, I had a greater and even more difficult decision to make. I had a girlfriend at the time, of nearly a year and a half, and sure I was in love, and she was so supportive, she told me to go do it, she could see how unhappy I was back in England. Having someone like this is rare, but that made it all the more difficult to leave, and this taste of travel I have gave me an ultimatum at one point.Do I continue to travel whilst I can and I’m in Asia and lose my other half? Or do I go home to her, and find a job I could be unhappy in and so to say, ‘suffer’?So I did decide to extend my trip. I may have another opportunity to travel Southeast Asia, but right now seemed perfect, other than the relationship situation. However she was off to America for three months and then Germany for a year, so in hindsight it wouldn’t have worked anyway. I had the money to travel, I had the desire, so why not?I’ve learnt so much, I really have, and I have a group of friends back home who always joke about people going away and coming back a changed person because of ‘travel’. Well it does change you.Getting out of your comfort zone is one thing it certainly teaches you and with that comes not caring what everyone thinks about you, so I reckon I’ve changed and for the better. I’ve learnt that humans aren’t actually too bad. Living in England, especially around London, gives you so many chances to doubt mankind and very little to believe in it, and sometimes people can’t help but bring you down. When I’ve travelled, you have little else to do but invest in people, you have to understand people, their backgrounds, their ‘real’ stories, how people differ, you learn so much from people.Try anything, something new is always interesting whether it’s an experience or food, something you wouldn’t do back home. Cracking a smile at a stranger — a smile I’ve learnt goes miles, it can make that persons day, you really never know, but what help is a frown doing? Nothing. Along with that I learnt to strike up conversations more, because more often or not people actually want to talk to each other. Nowadays we tend towards alienating ourselves, maybe through lack of confidence or maybe because it’s ‘weird’ to talk in person with technology at our fingertips. Another lesson that I gained that was valuable is that life really isn’t that serious, accept humility, because what happens, happens, go skinny-dipping, jump off a cliff, what’s a broken bone to an awesome story?One major realisation was that the problems that you perceive are problems back home, are probably little more than an issue if anything at all, it’s probably nothing. You probably think it’s the worse thing at the time, take a step back, does it really matter? The answer is probably no. Then why stress? No point hey? So relax. I used to be like that. I was never the most relaxed person, but now I’ve learnt to feel a bit more comfortable in my skin, just relax, it sounds easier said then done, but give it a go.People seem to care too much about pleasing everyone, and don’t get me wrong it’s great to make people happy and smile, but when it comes down to it you just can’t please everyone. If someone doesn’t like you or doesn’t agree with you, then don’t worry, it probably means you stood up for something you believe in. Guess what? There are still seven-billion people in the world, so I’m sure the odds of people liking you are in your favour.Well to settle down is a horrifying thought, it likes the great quote I once saw…So training in the art of avoiding routine is one thing I plan to do, but to put it simply I need to make some money, damn I hate money, how some paper can run your life. So I’m going to be putting more work into my website, look for a sponsor that has the same beliefs and ethics as me, that will help me propel forward to continue writing whilst travelling. However with regards to making some money I’m looking into writing opportunities and collaborations, and following another passion — coffee. I love coffee and I’m looking to train as a barista for a little while, hopefully for an independent company, it’s strange, but it’s something that excites me, and whilst it’s nothing glamorous it’s interesting to me!I have worked since the age of fourteen, at that age I was cleaning cars and cutting grass. At the legal age of sixteen I tried to get jobs and I did so, at the age of seventeen I was working six different part-time jobs, all to fund my travels in the future, and since then I’ve always saved up, and been religious in doing so. I tax myself, knowing that the government are going to tax me anyway, I tax myself on-top of that, so I know that money will be going towards my travels. Towards the end I did run out of money. My Dad, being a great man, did help me out fortunately enough, but it’s great because he knows 100% he’s going to be getting back whatever money I owe him. I also used some credit too, which I’m not proud of, but when it gets serious, you have to. I always have a contingency plan for stuff like this. With this trip it has made me think what do I really need in my life, so when I get back home, I’m selling everything that is not needed. Sorted.I didn’t find too much hard in reality. Learning to get out of my comfort zone was a bit of a challenge initially but because I jumped into the deep end I had no option. I found it particular hard saying goodbye to friends that I met along the way, several in particular.I travelled with an Israeli guy for nearly nine weeks, a Mexican for six weeks, an Australian for two weeks, and I met a lady from Germany who was fantastic, and saying goodbye to all these amazing people was really difficult. However they’re all people I plan on seeing in the future because each and everyone of them made such an impact on myself but more so my travels. It’s the people you meet whilst travelling that can make it that much more special. The last difficult part for me was the realisation of heading back home.

The ritual begins with the placing of headphones and an exaggerated slouch in the seat, legs outstretched. After six years of travel, my husband knows the routine. We were pulling away from I was sad to leave, yet still did so with a huge smile on my face. A new journey was upon us, and I was ready for six hours of blissful alone time with my thoughts, my music, and a rolling variety of scenery.As we reached the outer limits of the city I could feel Pete staring at me, and glanced over to find him grinning. Rather than risk my wrath by asking me to take off my headphones so he could relay his thoughts, he instead typed them on his phone and reached over to show me.I think our marriage is extraordinary. Although I hope it’s not, I hope it is actually quite ordinary and regular for people to be as in love as we are for so long. We’ve been living nomadically for six years and married for almost fourteen. We’re almost at the point where we’ve been traveling for half of our marriage, and for nearly every moment of every waking hour, I still only think of Pete with pure adoration.We know couples who haven’t made it a year on the road. We have other friends back home who have said that a two week vacation together is stressful enough, that anything longer would surely end them.At first, it wasn’t easy for us either. We went from our more traditional marriage roles of Never mind that we also went from only spending a few hours a day together — the best of which was during our hourly commute to and from work — to being side by side around the clock. As the only physical constant in each others lives, it means being exposed to every emotion the other feels and bearing the brunt of every manifestation of stress, lack of sleep, or pang of hunger. He has to be my best girlfriend and listen to me whine about the frizziness of my hair, and I have to help him pick his fantasy football line-up (my sole criteria usually being how good looking they are). We have no close friends readily available to shoulder some of this essential chatter.Traveling together can be a severe make-or-break situation and in our first year on the road it was a struggle. Thankfully now, many years in, we’ve gone from frequent screamfests to minor skirmishes. We’ve faced some difficult situations where we knew that the only way to get through it was to get through it. I think there are few topics that we could call ourselves definitively knowledgable in, but this is one of them (if anyone can be of marriage). Because with so much time spent together with this life on the road, ours is probably equivalent to fourteen years going on fifty relative to most. And we like each other. Love each other. Are smitten with, respect, and admire each other.So we have some nuggets of wisdom to share, lessons we’ve often learned the hard way, and some that I am sure we wouldn’t have fully grasped by now had we not taken our lives in such an unorthodox direction.Yes, we can barely stand to be apart, but there are also times when we can barely stand to be together. This was a sticking point in our first year of travel — even if we knew we needed time apart, we couldn’t say it to each other. At least not without the other taking severe offense. But now, No, I had no desire to hike five days through the Colombian jungle, sleep in hammocks every night and wake up to scorpions in my shoe. Yes, maybe these examples seem trite, but I hope you get my point — many decisions in a relationships are best arrived at by landing somewhere in the middle, but it doesn’t always have to be that way. Let your partner fulfill individual desires, stifling them may only manifest in some other way that’s ugly. The key is to nurture, not dissuade. We may be “one”, but we can’t forget that we are also individuals.Drop the small stuff, Especially now that we are also running businesses together, potential for disagreement can arise dozens of times in a day. I consider us both quite masterful at being able to turn around from a tiff in mere minutes. Basically because we don’t have time to fight before we’re onto the next task or problem to be solved.Any article with lessons about marriage has to include a point about having a “date night”. So yes, do that.But, c’mon, Typically we are hand holders and unabashed public smoochers, but there are some places in the world where this just isn’t acceptable. And when in those places we will keep our respectable distance, and have learned to come up with a clever way to still show our affection.So there is one thing Pete does that drives me nuts, and this has only come about after spending so much time together.Well yes, I probably am cranky and snapping at him because I’m hungry, but I often won’t realize it myself until after he’s escorted me into a cafe and orders us a snack (and then I’m even further perturbed at being coddled). But I suppose I also do it to him in the reverse, when he’s suddenly cursing at me from behind his laptop screen, it’s usually time to suggest that we get outside and go for a walk.And problems can of course run deeper than the odd bad mood, but the same lesson applies: take the other side. Try to understand where the anger is coming from. The source is sometimes not indicative at all of how it emerges. Maybe I am truly enraged at him for not completing a task on time, or maybe some of that anger is built up from Trump being a total twat. Bring her coffee in bed. Write him love notes on shower doors. Hold hands. Make dinner Just be awesome to each other. They say that the best jobs shouldn’t feel like work, and I think that applies to relationships. Yes, they do require work to survive, but it really shouldn’t feel like it.And that’s where I believe Pete and I are. Most days are peaceful and blissful, but we’re not perfect. We fight, we get ugly with each other, we curse, there is the odd instance of nasty name-calling.But we simply forget it, because most issues really aren’t worth remembering. Or we talk and learn from it, because we ultimately just want to be awesome-er to each other. Or we let it manifest, blow up about it, and go back to step one until we get it right.But we always, Dalene and her husband Pete have been nomadic since 2009 and blog at HeckticTravels.com.

Traveling in Mexico is a different beast indeed. This was my second trip to the country, but the first didn’t give me as much of a taste because it was during Navidad (Christmas) when most attractions are closed, allowing people to spend time with their families.And Chihuahua is in a desert so it was cold as all get-out.As much as I’m on the road, traveling in a developing country still feels like a new experience. Let’s start with that phrase — “developing country.” It’s not PC to say “third world” anymore (and where is the If I use that phrase, what comes to your mind?The first thing that pops into my head is the bathrooms and the dread in my stomach of having to find one in a moment of need (though there These things are all true of Mexico. And, to different degrees, these were a part of my experience. But Mexico is an odd place, though, because all of these things exist alongside Walmarts and McDonald’s and supermarket chains. They exist alongside families that look and feel much like your own. They exist with parks and schools and museums and the like. It feels incredibly foreign but surprisingly familiar.[Note: And it’s not that there isn’t poverty in the United States. It is everywhere here. I am proud to be an American and yet humiliated that despite our wealth we have so many citizens living in poverty. Another post for another time.]What I did not expect was the warmth of the people that we met and how helpful and kind they were, especially in the Yucatan. I didn’t expect these to be a completely blended experience. I didn’t realize I would be pondering and processing, both ready to return and excited to try travel in a place that was foreign but more familiar.There was one significant barrier that I wasn’t able to overcome. No matter what I try, I can’t blend it. I’m not just talking about learning Spanish — Mexican Looks aside, even in a county with such a warm and friendly culture, when you lack the language to communicate, you don’t experience what would otherwise be possible. The special exchanges I was hoping for? They happened but they were few and far between. Sergio was treated to these encounters on a daily basis — people stopped him to talk, to share their stories and learn his, and invite him into cultural traditions or advise him about experiencing the local culture.I have much to learn and I look forward to opportunities to travel in Mexico again as well as visit other places that will push me out of my travel comfort zone. If there’s one thing that still challenges me, it’s being a noob at anything. So if you, like me, are new to traveling in developing countries, here are my initial tips to improve your experience:“Ugh,” I told Sergio. “What is it with this country and eating so darn late?” To move away from food, I was slightly baffled and a little judgmental when I learned how short the school day is for some Mexican students. “Shouldn’t they be studying These assumptions rise from our lips no matter where we travel, even within our own countries. Suddenly you are indignant that The older I get and the more I travel the more I realize there are nearly infinite variations on how to do just about everything (read Jared Diamond’s book This is especially true in developing countries were many things we take for granted — public services, no child labor, less corrupt government — might not exist. And this might be especially difficult if you, like me, have strong preferences.Observe. Be curious. Let the new ideas sink in and see what happens — or, in my case, have two lunches so you’re not hungry at 3pm. When I allowed myself to really Here’s the thing — we didn’t go to the Yucatan to buy cheap-ass goods made in China. Even if goods are stocked in local stores, how do I know that they benefit local people? If I’m buying a postcard, that’s fine. But if I buy “local crafts,” shouldn’t I get something It’s no secret that tourist dollars can have a big impact on the economy of a developing country. Make your count. Instead of just buying stuff, learn the story beyond what you purchase and support the craftspeople who made it. Do some research about the signature products of a region, then ask locals for the best places to go to find what you are looking for.In Merida, we found a cooperative that sold traditional crafts made by more than 3000 Yucatecan families. Staffed by passionate volunteers, the goods at the cooperative were well-made, clearly much better made than what most of the souvenir shops were proffering.The volunteers were excited to share about everything in Bottom line — Avoid cheap tchotchkes. Instead, purchase something made with skill and care. You’ll support local artisans and craftspeople and help preserve the culture.What surprised me was the We both got food poisoning — Sergio ate ceviche even though he knew better (it was at a very nice restaurant, so we were surprised) and I was rather obsessive about what I ate and still got sick. As we were reading in bed one morning, we moaned about being When you travel outside of your comfort zone, This was a great exercise for me — I need to trust my own instincts and not doubt myself if someone else has a different idea of what is best for me. If you are fearless and have an iron stomach, live it up for me!In this month’s For all of the wonderful elements of Mexico, or any developing country, there might be serious challenges for people living in those countries. Be a respectful visitor because long after you return to water from the tap and your fancy car, the people you meet will remain in their own lives.There is a sign posted at an Oregon beach that comes to mind — Leave only footsteps and take only memories. If your instincts are to help or to do something when you visit a developing country, it means you have a heart. Find a meaningful way to interact and, if upon further reflection, you decide you want to help, find a meaningful way to do that too.What excites me is that this is only the first of many trips to Mexico. I’m still processing what I experienced and with time I hope to distill more of what I learned.xo, SarahP.S. I’m very excited to share more with you!

In pursuit of happinessI once also had a job that paid well. I left that company to start a company to challenge myself. But like the quote “Nothing’s forever and there’s no such thing as friends in the business”, the reality hit me hard and in the end I resulted in a shitty situation with debt. I wanted to leave behind my past so i decided to pack my bags and leave Korea.Life outside of home was the completely different from what I’ve known. First place I went and started working at was a freezer storage company in Australia. I worked day and night to pay back the debt I left behind in Korea. In 8 months I was able to pay back everything I owed. It was physically challenging at times but it was rather refreshing to be sweating for the money I earned. It kept me busy and cleared my mind. During that time, I often questioned myself on my happiness.While i was in Australia, I met a french friend that introduced me to a share house. I met people from all over the world including France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, and Italy. Couple of friends i met were musicians. On weekends, we would have parties and made music. It was great and i realized.“Shit, this is really fun!”In college, i joined a rock music club. It wasn’t satisfying enough so I created a punk band to create more serious music. We even auditioned at live clubs. But that was the extend of it. I came from a very normal korean family. It wasn’t even a question to pursue music in a family like mine. After college, I got a job. I never thought or reconsidered music in the path that i was taking.Since then, this theme of I can be certain of only one thing. I have no regret leaving behind everything for this life i chose. I don’t have insurances, secure job, beautiful wife, adorable son, nor saved up retirement fund.Truth be told, I don’t have much but because I don’t its easy for me to travel. It’s pretty much “Is the glass half empty or half full?”. In positive perspective, everything is endlessly great but if you take it in a negative perspective it can be endlessly miserable. I am very sorry to my parents. But I can’t please or fulfill everything in life. I decided to take one path and decided to leave another.Where will i be? What is my future? I am not really certain. After 2 years and 8 months of leaving korea, I realize self confidence in yourself is much more important then having confidence in things that will fulfill you in materialistic ways.Don’t think too much. If we happen to meet on the road, lets grab a drink and make some music._______Follow us through:We design Korea.

Of course, you can always access lots of information about both places in Wikitravel, Tripadvisor, Lonely Planet. However too many choices can be a confusion so below are my recommendations with reasons.A must-see destination in Vietnam. A bit like Krabi bay in Thailand but bigger and more variation of landscape. Most tour companies organize trips here with not so much different schedule, which may leads to:Don’t get me wrong. Ha Long bay itself is amazingly beautiful, but spending time doing the same things, going to the same locations in a fixed schedule with a group you may/ may not like is not the best choice.If you still choose to go there, out of various tour companies which offer 2D1N tours to Ha Long bay, this one has good services that I recommend:Why choose them?Okay forget about Ha Long bay  V’ spirit because I am gonna show you the hot sister of Ha Long. Remember when people compare New Zealand with Australia and NZ wins over in terms of landscape with the nickname “the hot sister of Aus”? Cat Ba island is just like that.Remember that they are only different in provincial boundary (Ha Long bay belongs to Quang Ninh province, Cat Ba island  Lan Ha bay belongs to Hai Phong province)Regarding geological formation though, they are one. Yet due to unbalance in PR  international marketing exposure, most people flock to Ha Long without seeing the bigger picture, not knowing what they miss.At its best, Ha Long bay looks like this:And this is Lan Ha bay, still the same bay with a different name and less people. Been there last week and the weather could not ‘ve been betterSaying that means if you go to both place, satisfaction of scenery is similar. What makes Cat Ba more favorable is its various selection of activities.In Ha long bay when you stay over night, the only option is to stay in a boat. Some boats are boring, some are interesting, depending on the folks in your groups. Whereas in Cat Ba island, boating and boat overnight is just one of many options.Other activities includeLittle Cat Ba, a lovely quiet villa-style lodging in Cat Ba with a reasonable price (around 25$ downward) .

I think I might have developed some muscle memory from years of seasoned traveling. I never realized this before, but traveling for back-to-back work trips of late, I realize I have subconsciously curated a routine for self-preservation and self-care. I am going to attempt to externalize these habits in words. Here goes.When you travel alone through foreign cities as a young woman,you discard fashion consciousness for coats with buttoned pockets, pants with front pockets, and bags with zippers, to keep your essential items safe.you master the art of spreading out your cash among pockets and wallets and pouches and bags.you learn to manage multiple currencies and coins (good grief!) with sassy compartmentalization, and memorize these slots to prevent too much fumbling in public.you fold the multiple maps and papers in your pockets into different sizes and shapes, so that you can fish out the one you need quickly without appearing like a lost tourist.you work basic origami magic to get your maps palm-sized, so you don’t signal your uncertainty and appear like an easy target at intersections.you navigate and load Google maps pinpointing your next destination whenever you chance upon brief Internet connections at cafes and galleries, since the wonders of satellite technology updates your geolocation even if you continue on your journey without wifi.you detour and take longer routes in order to remain visible to the general public, or to walk where the streets are better lit for self-assurance and comfort.you train yourself to put away distractions like smartphones and books on short-distance commutes so that you can be alert of your surroundings, and to visually and kinesthetically memorize landmarks, signs, and routes for future reference.But when you travel alone through foreign cities as a young woman,you fight sexism daily, and find yourself in compromising situations every now and then.I’m not saying that I hate men. Or that I think I’m an attractive target. Or that I constantly feel unsafe when traveling alone in foreign cities. I just keep falling into the same dilemma that requires me to make a fight or flight response in a matter of split seconds. And I’m now realizing how much affective, emotional, and intellectual labour I need to mobilize in these lapses on a daily basis.When you’re walking alone on the street, in broad daylight or in the late evening, men cat call. You have split seconds to decide how you want to react, because even choosing to ignore the act is a passive response in itself.You have to decide if you want to turn back, catch their gaze, assert confidence, and flash a “HEY! YOU CHINESE?! I’LL GIVE YOU ONE, DAMN!” /no I’m not really Chinese, and I don’t know what that means, but I don’t want to reciprocate your social interaction.“GO BACK TO CHINA!” /no I’m not from China, and I don’t know what you have against China, but I don’t want to engage in banter.“HEY HEY, YOU ALONE? WANT SOME COMPANY?” /yes I’m alone, no I don’t want your company, and I don’t want to encourage your solicitation.“HEY MISS! LOOKING FOR SOME FUN?” /no. Just no. And who are you to speak to me like this? You’re violating my soundscape and my personal space.Maybe you’re chowing down on a hotdog at a street stand, and a bunch of men start chuckling and hollering at you from a short distance away. There are suggestive hand gestures, and you feel like you should have eaten some place else. Again, you have seconds to decide whether to walk away, to roll your eyes, or engage in a gaze that displays your But sometimes, I worry about aggravating the situation, and restrain myself from attempting to posture sass and all that jazz, especially when I’m clearly outnumbered. So I walk away.And this makes me angry inside,because we fight sexism every day in our mundane actions and personal posturing.And I feel like by walking away, I am being complicit in this structural/cultural/social violence. And I also lament over having lost an opportunity to intervene at the level of a simple micro-action. I feel helpless for censoring my personal voice.I spend my career writing about systemic inequalities and feminism, but when it When you travel alone through foreign cities as a young woman,you also learn to posture for self-preservation.you modulate your voice to solicit favour from service staff, or from strangers on the street when asking for directions.you make friendly conversation with wait staff in cafes and restaurants, who sometimes ask you about your travel plans and volunteer life hacks and travel tips, such as which alleys to avoid or which routes are the safest.you subconsciously sit next to other women, rather than men, when commuting on public transport. (I don’t know why I do this.)you learn to hold conversation with strangers, and calibrate small talk and transient intimacies and intense revelations with these passing persons you will never meet again.you over-think the act of holding a gaze with strangers, trying to ascertain if a smile or nod or morning greeting might be socially appropriate.When you travel alone through foreign cities as a young woman,you learn to manage sensory overload, flight or fight, all while taking in the sights and sounds and scents of the streets.you learn about self-preservation and to have patience, while prancing around spontaneously.But do you still have a voice?Like this:Like Loading…

You arrive at the airport and your luggage is overweight and you find your-self facing two options:Or you arrive at the destination but not your suitcase, or vice-versa.etc etc…Do these scenarios sound familiar to you? So bear with me for some tips for a smooth journey for you and your bag.Sometimes happens, especially with a low cost airline, that at the check-in desk they ask you to pay the extra weight of your luggage.So, if you don’t want to use your vacation money, always ask someone to take you to the airport and make sure they stay around, in case you need to leave the extra cloths.(You can use this tip especially if you are flying from Italy and they stop you when you are trying to bring some pesto sauce or parmesan, so they wont get wasted in a bin).Firstly, when you are travelling you need to think like a Project Manager: you need to have a plan A-B-C.And as a good Project Manager you need to think about all the things that could possibly happen and their consequences.For example, What do you do if your luggage gets lost? You go to lost and found, sure. But do you ask for your bag to be sent to your current location or back to your permanent home? And if the stay is one week or four days?I know, it sounds stressful. First of all, you need to define your vacation: is it a road trip? Is it a two weeks stay in the same location?When I asked a captain what tip would you give when travelling with a luggage? His answers was:Thanks for the tip captain! But not everyone has the luxury of having a credit card to use and spend for a new ‘wardrobe abroad’.My advice is always to plan everything in advance, for example, if you are going to do a road trip, try to estimate where your stay is going to be, it will help.Or, always have a small hand-luggage with you, where you can put the essentials: Tooth brush,small tooth paste and underwear and so on..In conclusion, I advise to travel with hand-luggage. Especially if you are passing through bigger airports, as your luggage will have a higher chance of being lost.Remember…Nobody can steal your knowledgeOverflying The News

One In a few years, I can imagine Horizon being used to find a member of Impact Hub to stay with for a few days in Barcelona, meet a fellow SigEp (my fraternity) for a night out during that same trip, and discover a friend who wants to sublet my apartment in Seattle for a couple weeks while I housesit a friend of a friend’s place in Ubud — all while making it easy to donate back to the organizations that made those experiences possible.There are also practical considerations like what images would lend themselves to a text overlay and what images would look good cropped into the iPhone’s portrait display size.Asking questions for answers about design.

One week of driving from Toronto to Buffalo and west to the Rockies, then south to Arizona (over 120°F), where we stayed for a week — this was my While driving 5,000 KM over the course of a few days (we flew home, thankfully) may sound exhausting, there were great unexpected stops, lessons, new experiences and hilarious moments. As an entrepreneur, changing up your routine and being exposed to all of this can have an awesome impact.Here are a few reasons why entrepreneurs should travel regularly, based on my experience.Whether they come to you on the trip — looking out the window as you drive down a busy city street for the first time — or when you’re back home in full work mode, there’s something about getting out of the house, office, or coffee shop and taking in a fresh view. It can quite literally change your perspective.There are also many articles about how a change in scenery can help with New networking opportunities are everywhere. Meeting new people while traveling can include customers or future business partners, even through a well-conected waitress or convenience store cashier. Expected or spontaneous, you can learn about the lifestyles of people in other areas, see how they think, get a sense of what people need or lack, and share your story and perspective with them. (Also, locals can give you far better recommendations than a travel website).On the road you can see countless examples of what other businesses are doing and how they are positioning themselves. Since you’re in town, you can look into collaboration, or even borrow from their approach when you’re back home. You may even come up with a solution to a local problem, and create a new service offering or product out of it. (Again, something you could’ve only seen when you’re present there).Traveling is a constant reminder of how massive the world really is, how small you are, and how much there still is for you to tap-into!During day-to-day business operations, it’s tough to find time to really sit and think. While traveling, you can much more easily let your mind wonder (maybe out the window, through miles of endless fields; and in a case like mine, bare desert). You may ask “why” or “what if” about the things around you. Or you may dive deep into solving a problem you have back at work. (Take a look at this talk on As a business owner, freelancer or entrepreneur, you’ve got tons of responsibilities — which also come with the benefit of freedom to make your own schedule! (You don’t have to give weeks of notice before leaving, or apply for days off work, or work your trip into a strict 7 days out of and entire 365). Plus, with so may tools available right on your smartphone, you can check-in with team members, set schedules, send and receive money, respond to emails, and even project manage and Of course, there’s different degrees of travel, and even spending a weekend away in a nearby small town or retreat centre, for example, has lots of benefits.If you’re convinced and are looking for a life of “constant adventure”, I suggest reading Chris Guillebeau’s book, Entrepreneur • Creative Director 

Ask anywhere for travel tips and you’ll get the “Free Spirit” method presented within minutes. But as a seasoned traveller I’d like to make a case for the Other Way.First, a quick introduction to the “Free Spirit” way. It revolves around not knowing where you’re going, what to do when you get there and just go with the flow. This is nice. Especially if you have plenty of time, money and few responsibilities. I.e if you’re some weird hybrid of a 30 something and a teenager.Since most of us aren’t (sadly) I would like to take this opportunity to outline an alternative that has served me well on many occasions.My wife and I grew up half a world away from each other. We love to go to her part of the world and we think it’s very important for our children to experience that part as well as possible. Buying four tickets instead of one is quite an economical burden.By booking at least six months ahead we are able to get god deals and pick seats at our leisure (without paying extra for those coveted emergency exit seats). Another great benefit is that we have plenty of time to absorb the costs of the tickets, so that by the time we go it feels as if it’s a free ride.Whenever I go some where I have really quick and effective research routine. It’s so formalized I could turn it into an app.This is a minimal effort way to get some good ideas of places to visit. I’m not saying you should never ask at the place you’re staying for tips, I strongly suggest you do, but by doing this you might end up at an amazing place one to two days travel from the place you initially intended to visit.This might seem like a no brainer. But bear in mind that local food can be more local than you think. Santorini has its own greek dishes and its own wine. So instead of ordering moussaka and retsina just ask the waiter what the local specialities are.I love hotel breakfasts, I really do. But they are largely the same wherever you go and they cost an arm and a leg. You’re much better off eating at a café nearby. Or ask a cab driver where the best breakfast place is at.Oh, the glorious adventure of arriving in a city late at night in pouring rain without a place to stay. There really is no reason for this. Hostelworld.com, airbnb.com, homeaway.com, bookings.com, hotels.com have all served me well over the years. Especially now that we travell as a family with small children. Not knowing where to stay is simply not an option anymore.If you’re moving cities during your vacation I can’t recommend sleeper trains enough. You save time and a hotel night. Trains in general are nice and if you go during the day you get the added bonus of nice, off the beaten path scenery. If you’re traveling with small children trains are just about the only decent option you have.The weather is lovely and every town worth its salt has some weird catholic easter parade. Florence and Sorrento are well worth a visit for their easter parades alone.Learn to say No, backpackers aren’t better than others. We’re all tourists. Embrace it. Own it. Make it yours. Whip out your big ass map and ask people for directions. Smile a lot and gawk at the wonders. Do take a “Look at me holding up the leaning tower of Pisa” picture. Visit The Louvre, The Forbidden City, Times Square and The Colloseum.Don’t feel as if you’re being ripped off just because there’s a “tourist tax” added to anything you buy at a market. We can afford it. But bargaining can be fun. See it as a game and always do it with a smile.Family man, Ölänning and Webworker who lived through the first bubble. Fond of jobs to be done. 

Today’s existential crisis began because of biryani.Biryani is one of my favourite meals for several reasons – it’s easy to order and easy to eat, it tastes different every single time, it’s the right kind of spicy, it’s festive.Today, I was in charge of transporting the ordered biryani from one aunt’s house to another’s . My cousin came along to assist, on our way back I was narrating some random future plans animatedly, while also enjoying1. the drive on empty Sunday roads 2. a rather up beat love songBad combination when you’re behind the steering wheel, my cousin suddenly noticed that the biryani was in the process of toppling over in the middle of my narration.My instantaneous existential crisis began withMy tried and tested method of unspiralling myself from spirals of my creation is to remind myself of what the faceless neighbour from Home Improvement said… (a trait that annoys me in others but seems to work on every kind of existential crisis known to me)A collection of a writer’s daily scribbles.

It means going to a new place, and that is always the space to create: somewhere new. It may not need to be a literal new location, but that can sometimes help. Rather, what happens when we create is that we make the space we are in new: we are changing the world around us, creating the brave new world that our acts of creation allow us to enter.Every choice, every decision we make takes us somewhere. When we create, we are going somewhere novel, interesting, different, new. When we choose not to create, that is the only decision that does not make a new place, but keeps everything the same. Perpetual, conservative, old, congealed… these are the places — physical or metaphysical — to avoid in order to create.Finding a new place is about a process: taking what is there, accepting it, and imposing your will upon the cosmos around you in order to make it different. A white page is ended by a scrawl of your creation; a naked canvas is clothed in colour; silence is filled with sound; the formless is given form; reality is shaped and sculpted to create a place that now holds an idea that previously existed only in potential.The travel to a new place can be external — get up and walk, move to a different room, tear a page from a pad of paper — or internal—thinking about a topic that is unfamiliar, imagining yourself in another person’s position, empathizing, sympathizing, synthesizing ideas—but the new place is always real.You make a new place to create by creating a new place.

Travel means something different to every person in the world. This is because different persons have different reasons for traveling and this is what brings the different definitions of the word “Travel”. In my opinion traveling is more than just visiting or seeing the souvenirs and pictures we bring back. It is about the experiences we gain. This experiences we gain from new environments and people we meet will help shape and transform us in ways that we might not even expect. I fully agreed with Ricks Steve in his book, “Travel As a Political Act” when he says, “We travel to have enlightening experiences, to meet inspirational people, to be stimulated, to learn, and to grow”. This means a purposeful travel must bring impact within us and our societies.Kenya citizen, Student 

Reasons Behind the Fall of TravelThe travel  leisure industry produces the least-intimate brand relationships compared to eight other industries that were studied as part of the 2015 Brand Intimacy Report. It ranks ninth out of nine in the United States and ranked second to last in both the UAE and Mexico. What has happened to this category that, at one point, filled consumers with wonder and excitement? Why is it unsuccessful at building strong bonds and creating ultimate brand relationships?The top travel brand in the U.S., British Airways, ranked 70th overall out of 200 brands. Compare this to the top automotive brand, BMW, which ranked second, or the top entertainment brand, Disney, which ranked sixth.Travel  Leisure has an average Brand Intimacy Quotient of 21, approximately 12 points below the collective average across all our nine industries. The top three brands are airlines, with British Airways ranking first and Jet Blue in third, with the highest rate of fusing at 6 percent. American Airlines emerged in 11th place. Marriott is the most intimate brand for 45–64-year-olds, whereas Southwest is highest among 18–34-year olds.While airline and hotel businesses are quite different, we hypothesize four potential reasons why this industry, despite its great potential to build intimacy, is falling short.When shopping online for flights, 75 percent of consumers say they use online travel agencies, while 54 percent use the supplier website.1 More consumers are booking trips using both traditional travel agents and online travel aggregator sites, bypassing the direct airline and hotel brand purchase experience. While the brand-specific sites may be designed to engage a consumer while highlighting benefits, unique qualities of the brand, and specific promotions, travel agents and online sites neutralize the experience and commoditize the way brands are depicted and detailed. It has been found that people who booked their previous trip using a price comparison site are the least likely to be influenced by a company’s reputation.² This suggests that the way consumers are procuring and purchasing travel may be the root cause for the decreasing significance of brand relationships.The power of social media and online recommendations has clearly proliferated, and travel is one of the categories that generates the most dialogue. Sites like TripAdvsior are dedicated to showcasing the recommendations and opinions of everyday consumers; these are widely respected and act as a source of influence for travelers. In fact, in 2015, 37 percent of travel customers said that review websites had “very much influence” on their choices. This is up from 27 percent in 2014.5One gets the sense that travel brands are cut out of the conversation that is taking place. The social channels for airlines and hotels tend to be seen as places for customer service complaints rather than credible sources of information and reviews which only adds to the frustrationTravel has changed. People are taking about 20 percent fewer leisure trips this year compared to 2014. More are taking just one trip, and fewer people are taking multiple trips.6 Trips with an air component have also dropped, from 39 percent in 2014 to 30 percent in 2015.7Reasons for this decline might include financial considerations, a lack of free time to travel, a lack of interest in traveling, or simply personal obligations. For many, travel has always been a “special occasion” event, something to look forward to and carefully plan; however, today, people book more last-minute trips, and travel more spontaneously. This may make them, by necessity, less brand particular.Additionally, the continued changes to airline loyalty programs, with their complex tiering and structures,8 makes them less relevant and often punitive (hence the creation of an entire ad campaign for Capital One with “no blackout dates”). The participation of airlines in alliance programs could diminish brand sensitivity and preference. The streamlining of business travel across enterprises also has resulted in a far less enjoyable experience with fewer perks and more bureaucracy for those who must travel for work.Another trend impacting the power of travel brands, particularly hotels, is homesharing. Whether driven by cost, availability or simply the desire to try something different, more travelers are using services like Airbnb and HomeAway. They may be seeking a more authentic experience, a more personal travel adventure, or just something unique.It is well known that air travel has become more complex with increased security demands and longer lines. In addition, Airline Quality Ratings (AQRs), which weigh on-time performance, mishandled baggage, involuntary denied boardings, and customer complaints, declined across the industry in 2014.10 For many consumers, travel is more of an ordeal than an adventure.Quality continues to be a serious issue, especially considering that fulfillment, the Brand Intimacy archetype most aligned to performance, is what ranks highest with consumers in this category. We clearly see a disconnect between what people want and expect and what they receive. The personal touch for which this industry was once known seems to have all but disappeared. This can be evidenced in limiting the customer experience to the time spent on a flight or in the hotel room and reducing features to limit costs versus adding services to build greater intimacy and connection with the brand. Airlines are seen as nickel-and-diming customers for essentials — such as checked bags and snacks — that were, until recently, free. Hotels are similarly removing amenities including mini-bars and room service. Brands are also becoming more generic and losing differentiators that once contributed to a brand’s experience. Aiming to increase usage, they now have a mass-market appeal with little focus on any particular target market or travel segment.Related to increasing usage, hotel operators specifically are proliferating the brands in their portfolios. The world’s ten largest hotel chains now offer a combined 113 brands at various price points, 31 of which didn’t exist a decade ago.11 It is hard to tell whom each brand is targeting as they seem less directed at any specific demographic (e.g., the budget traveler, the business traveler, the family vacationers) than in the past. In fact, this proliferation may be a result of hotels seeking more growth and signing more operating agreements rather than about identifying distinctive market segments. In the past, consumers might select a hotel they recognized, one where they felt comfortable and toward which they felt positive. Now, with more brands that fail to clearly distinguish themselves, it is harder to know what any given hotel is about, who it is meant for, and why — besides tactical reasons like location and price — anyone should select it. Therefore, it is difficult to create any real bonds with these brands because they all seem interchangeable with each other, or unfocused on their efforts. Airlines suffer a similar fate through mergers, which can result in the creation of an anonymous behemoth, and through the rise of low-budget carriers than can confuse travelers with regard to their role and their relationships with brands people already know and use.Why does a stronger Brand Intimacy Quotient matter? Intimate brands create significant business performance. The Top 10 Most Intimate Brands have outperformed established financial indices for both revenue and profit growth over the last ten years. In addition, those brands command a price premium, enjoying more financial resilience than non-intimate brands in the same industries.Continued financial challenges and mergers from airlines will likely continue to have a negative impact on the bonds they form with consumers. Brand Intimacy is difficult both to achieve and to maintain. Like bonds between people, it requires sustained effort and continual nurturing.We do firmly believe that this category, which is often about commemorating and celebrating, can regain its former luster. Technology today enables more targeted communications that can personalize the customer experience at key moments, and create the high-touch moments consumers have come to expect. Focusing on delighting the customer in big and small ways, demonstrating dialogue and inviting conversation, and finding meaningful ways to reward those consumers who have selected a particular brand can all help the category improve its ability to connect. Finding ways to create greater intimacy is the best strategy the category has to improve and grow.If you want to continue exploring:See the full Read our detailed To learn more about We are the Brand Intimacy Agency, creating, building and sustaining ultimate brand relationships.A comprehensive examination of how to create, sustain and measure ultimate brand relationships

I think I started to appreciate football more as a supporter than a spectator around 2 years ago when I moved to England. I gave up my ‘stable professional career’ back in Colombia for something new. Luckily it turned out to be a smart decision.I came to Manchester and I must admit that my first thought was to experience football in one of the “cathedrals of football” [Old Trafford] and to get to know the Manchester City phenomenon. Come on, it was Manchester, a town where you breathe football!! Thus, regardless of the high prices, I attended both grounds and rapidly became aware of the whole After going to some Champions League and Premier League matches, I embarked myself onto the best football experience of all my life: The 2014 World Cup in Brazil. I followed the Colombia National Team during the tournament with my dad. We visited 7 different cities in Brazil and we had a truly father-son bonding experience. Besides taking part in the best historic performance of Colombia in this tournament, I definitely learnt to cherish the connection with all the fans.Given the absurd hotel prices during the tournament, my dad and I decided to stay with locals. I remember that both in Cuiaba and Fortaleza we stayed in very humble homes, but extremely rich in kindness and passion for the beautiful game. Irene Sousa, a local leader of the Caucaia community near Fortaleza hosted us before the Colombia vs. Brazil mathc and made us feel at home.That was definitely a sort of experience money can’t buy and I understood how to love football for what it was: a sport that allows us fans to mingle, share and connect around the ball.After going forward with I had the same sensation when visiting our friends of Hence, it does not come down to the good or bad football; it’s been all about the experience of connecting with local and away fans around the beautiful game. Regardless of the technicality of the game, sharing a pint, talking endless hours about football and chanting with supporters is definitely the higher purpose. I believe in #FanPower!It makes a lot of sense, then, to encourage this sort of experiences by staying with local fans when traveling to watch some football. I’ve been there and even though I connected with fellow fans during the match, I felt quite disconnected and isolated during the previous moments of a game.

They range from small spaces formed by rocks on the seashore to pine forests in the Sierra de la Laguna to romantic places for dining by moonlight. They all definitely fall into the classification of secret places. While nature offers endless possibilities for finding that secluded spot, men and history have helped identify many exceptional places to visit. It would be impossible and unfair to purport to list them all, but it is possible to mention some.For two thirds of the year, whale shark, called the biggest fish on earth, live just off the beaches of It is one of the most extraordinary experiences you can imagine. No visit would be complete without trying a delicious tostada or seafood taco at one of the many restaurants along the waterfront of the capital city. They are a delightful traditional cuisine.El Triunfo, is a small village where spending a morning can be a nice adventure. Here time seems to have stopped, you have to simply walk to enjoy it. We recommend visiting the music museum located in an old house. The instruments are from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries. They evoke the boom times of the mining in the area. Hopefully, you can enjoy a delicious margarita made with homemade damiana liquor.Northwest of Baja California Sur is a unique destination because it has numerous islands of different sizes. However, not all are easily accessible and visitors must travel by authorized means. If you are looking for a nook surrounded by water, you have to visit the island of Espiritu Santo. Inhabited at different times by regional tribes, Espiritu Santo today is a diving paradise and the best place to appreciate the Sea of Cortez, the world’s aquarium.Precisely because of its location, the Biosphere Reserve Sierra de la Laguna is home to unimaginable places. The topography, biodiversity, climate, flora and fauna, make every space in the mountains a very special destination. Whether you’re on a 3,000 foot peak or one that’s more than 6,000 feet up, you will be able to appreciate nature in all its glory. It would be worth your while to be prepared for one or two nights of camping.Plan a day to visit some of these communities and get carried away by curiosity throughout the day, dare to explore the Ecological Sol de Mayo Ranch, located in the Zorra Canyon in the community of Santiago or Rancho del Refugio near the municipality of La Paz, relax in the hot springs of Santa Rita a few kilometers from Caduaño, or dive in the Cabo Pulmo National Park because they are all true natural museums that will enrich your trip.El Arte de Viajar | Información de Baja California Sur | Information about B.C.S | Los Cabos | La Paz | Loreto | Todos Santos | Comondú | MulegéThrough images and stories,we will provide you with travel ideas for experiencing Baja California Sur/A través de imágenes e historias compartimos ideas de viaje.

To start off, ask yourself this question, why do you want to travel? The answer to this question may not be as simple or as straight forward as you might think. Not to over-complicate things, but this question will decide on where you will go, how much you would want to spend on your vacation, and what kind of activities you will do. So spend as much time deciding on the answer.It could be one, or a combination of the followingAnswering the question will decide on the style of your vacation. For me, I have a busy life style here in Kuwait. Things vary between my day job, my small business and initiatives, my studies, the gym and social life responsibilities. I tend to want to travel every 3 months or so. It doesn’t have to be a long vacation, a short weekend getaway will do. But every now and then I want to have what we all call a Real Vacation. Usually it’s a combination of the following:I don’t mind allocating a big budget to do the above. The places that I usually go to are pretty far and I always do multi-destination trips, going through multiple countries. I’m very active when I travel and end up covering tons of activities in a single day, spending no more than 4 nights in a single city or country. So, I end up burning a huge chunk of my travel budget on hotels and air plane tickets.You may not find the best prices at Expedia, so be sure to check the airline websites for a better prices. Tried Skiplagged couple of times and get got me the best prices that i couldn’t match anywhere else, however it does not always work.Always think strategically when you book a hotel. Look at the hotel location on Google Maps and make sure it’s not too far from the places that you will spend most of your time at. AirBnB is a new concept of booking a place (House, apartment etc..). I highly recommend that you check them out, as my experience using it has always been great.Hope this helps with your travel plans and as always, feel free to ask us for consultations!Happy traveling!

Have you been to Cinque Terre recently? Or the Sistine Chapel? Or the center of Paris, Amsterdam, Florence, or any other major European city? Did you notice the crowds? Of course you did- you were were practically crushed to death by a stampede of selfie-snapping fellow tourists.Of course everything was better in the good old days.When Bali was still an undiscovered paradise. And St Tropez a rustic little fishing village. When a single InterRail ticket would provide for unlimited roaming in Europe without worrying about seat reservations and high-speed supplements.Those days are long and truly gone, never to come back.At the beginning of the 21st century, a number of global economic and political shifts have changed the face of tourism forever, and as a result, the world’s (but in particular Europe’s) cities and sights are slowly turning into Disneyland.The dreaded word in European city halls is ‘Venice’. Because people fear the fate of the former Most Serene Republic on the Adriatic: a historical set piece for tourism, where regular inhabitants have been chased out by stratospheric property prices and the inability to find a supermarket to buy loo paper and pasta sauce (whereas there’s no shortage of tacky tourist shops selling identical tourist tat and cheesy t-shirts.)What has changed? Why are Paris, Amsterdam, Rome and Prague facing Venicefication? There’s been much talk about budget airlines and the popularity of European weekend breaks. But don’t blame RyanAir, as there are bigger, global economic forces at play: the end of the Cold War and the economic liberalisation of China and India. The same factors that are wrecking Europe’s global competitiveness and welfare systems are driving Venicefication- in Europe as well as the rest of the world.In the past 30 years, 500 million Chinese have been lifted out of poverty. 250 million Indians are now middle class. The Eastern Block is gone, and Poles and Russians travel freely. This is great news. More people live longer, happier, wealthier lives.As their income expands, people’s aspirations shift from material goods to experiences- seeing the world. They start with their own country- if you think Venice is busy, wait till you see no matter which touristic attraction in China or the Taj Mahal in India. Domestic tourists now far outnumber foreign visitors in both countries- by something like a factor 100!And as people become more affluent, they start travelling further- and whatever one may think of Europe’s economic competitiveness, its history and culture are still the number one attraction for new travellers, coming from either the New World or a New Economy.It’s elementary supply and demand- the world’s (and especially Europe’s) supply of attractions is basically fixed (nobody builds medieval cathedrals or Roman amphitheatres these days) whereas demand has gone through the roof. The result: Kumbh Mela-style crowds drown out local life in Europe’s historical town centers.The problem is of course exacerbated by the herd mentality of the average tourist, and the travel industry’s propensity of thinking in terms of ‘must-see’, ‘can’t miss’ and ‘hidden gems’ (usually hidden in plain sight in the list of ‘Top 10 things to do’). Everybody wants the most bang for their buck and invariably that translates into ‘hitting up’ the ‘top tourist sites’ and ‘checking off’ Tripadvisor’s Top 10 attractions.And as is often the case in life, the 80–20 rule applies. 80% of tourists visit 20% of the attractions. Or maybe I’m being too generous here, and 90–10 is more like it.And so the global desire to travel and sightsee has become a victim of its own success, creating miserable experiences for everybody on their ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ trip to see the world’s iconic sights.Already governments and municipalities are stepping in. Several European cities have imposed regulations to Expect to pay more. At some point municipalities will start taxing tourists more heavily. Where official authorities are loath to act, the free market will provide solutions. Want to enjoy the Sistine Chapel quietly? My friend, special price for you! Only At the same time, don’t expect too much: nobody wants to kill the proverbial golden goose. In Paris, chic department store Galeries Lafayette If you’re like me, and you prefer to do your sightseeing without the company of 50.000 others, what can you do? Here are five tips.We love visiting places that are rarely mentioned in guidebooks. Many Minor Sights are every bit as fascinating as the more famous ones. 

Everyone you know at office, in college (yes, college),the infamous Facebook friends are planning intricate international trips to distinctive places across the globe. Then you see every tiny detail of that vacation on social media. Be it the flamboyant sunset or that impressive bath tub, it’s up there with a sweet caption and several unnecessary hashtags!All the evidence of that vacation sends out mixed signals, whether it was a real getaway, a I’ve- really-relaxed-and-you-cannot-mess-with-my-mind kind of holiday, or it simply was an elite trip to keep up the status quo, to cross off that destination from an imaginary mental list so there can be tons of Instagram posts and constant tweets.I believe there are two kinds of people that want to travel, and I’d like to call them: The Mundane Travellers and The Soulful Explorers.The former are ones that want to boast about the places they have seen as part of that routine yearly holiday, the extravagant resorts or hotels visited and the reluctant souvenirs purchased for all relatives. Well, it is a socially acceptable and preferred system.But I personally find the Soulful Explorers more interesting. They treat travel as a discovery, of new and unexplored places and a discovery of themselves. They travel to unwind! Their travel does not include the perfect martini at the poolside, it involves dancing the regions folk dance in the mud. These are the very individuals that are just drawn to new experiences, cultures and people. There is a constant pull to see more and to go further. The fact that the place is out of fashion, forgotten or not yet on the map doesn’t make it less interesting to them. They blend in, absorb and rivet to the place and its people. The souvenirs they bring back are rustic, sometimes may just be even a bag full of sand or a simple piece of faded cloth woven by the locals. But they hold a memory so strong that makes it more valuable than a fancy scarf.Explorers capture moments, raw emotions, and honest smiles in their pictures. These pictures lug you into that experience with such precision that it baffles you every single time, how much a single shot of an elderly man with baskets at the local market, can do.We need to learn to travel to experience rather than relax. We must be willing to tread paths less frequently travelled and be spontaneous enough to make the time.This is a striking excerpt from Kent Nerburn’s So there lies before us a choice, one that is a little more complex that choosing between a slice blueberry cheesecake and a red velvet cupcake. We have to choose to either be a Mundane Traveller with an itinerary and a fixed buffet breakfast or be a Soulful Explorer and leave a little part of your soul every place you visit.Have you made that choice yet?

For nearly 2 years now, Nik and I have been continuously reviewing travel destinations. That is a tedious little task, even for ardent travelers like ourselves, but our hard work has paid off and the result can be seen at At first glance, both of these may seem like your average travel blog/website/startup. Pictures of beaches, superlatives thrown around here and there, what’s really new? As succinctly as I can put it: it’s about the data and how we give you access to the data.In the endlessly saturated world of travel startups, what we believe sets us apart from the competition are three things:On Travelindicator, themes are not a black and white thing. We see themes as a score ranging from nil to a hundred. A visit to Bangkok sounds pretty exciting to us, more so than a visit to Berlin, but that doesn’t exactly mean that Berlin is a totally unexciting place, does it?And would it be fair to say that the level of excitement of a Berlin is quite similar to that of for instance Warsaw, but that the city is quite a bit more exciting than Bremen? Similar paragraphs could be typed about how Venice is the pinnacle of romance, but surely Bologna is not as unromantic as let’s say Duesseldorf (sorry)?You can see that just rating places on one theme already gives you an idea of which locations are comparable and which aren’t. Doing so on 23 of them for a 1,000 places gives you an interesting dataset to work with, as you can now basically find the exact replica or closest alternative of any place on this globe! Like the Maldives but want a cheaper alternative? On Travelindicator, easy does it.

I actually got so depressed after travelling. It was overwhelming, like my life was a lie. What is my life even? Great article, thank you!bleh I dont even know anymore

Traveling inevitably makes you want to travel more, but it also helps you get more out of being where you are.I try to help people communicate better. (

Lucy, my girlfriend, left at the start of June to go on a 3 month long volunteering program based in Nyimba, Zambia. Whilst she was out there she would be specialising in educating people on sexual health primarily.So, a few weeks in, a job opportunity I was hoping for backfired which was a huge hit to myself and rather spontaneously from the spare time I would now have I decided to book a 2 week trip to Africa. I knew Lucy was having a tough time out there and was pretty down with the program and living conditions (her host family don’t have power or running water) and I was beginning to struggle at home by this point, I found it so difficult not seeing somebody for so long. Overall I felt this would be great for both of us to cheer us all up and an excellent time to see her as I’d booked it right in the middle of the program.The day came, I had two flights before I reached Zambia.London Heathrow  Johannesburg  LusakaAs we usually spoke over text in the day and I wanted this to be a complete surprise I booked the flights so i would be in the air overnight. I finally reached Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, the day after and had booked a hotel to stay in that night. It was such a great feeling chatting to Lucy that evening over text knowing I was in the same country as her and tomorrow I would be seeing her again. Because Lucy was in Nyimba, a town around 350km out of Lusaka I had to catch a 4:30am local bus the next day that would take me on the 5 hour journey. I managed to find a suitable company offering the trip, the busses were reasonably comfortable and not too cramped, I’m 6ft3 so any leg room is appreciated.I finally rolled into the village of Nyimba around 10am and was taken to my lodge I would be staying at just up the road. I’d spoken to Lucy that morning and she was out on her placement until around 3 in the afternoon, no problem. I decided to take this opportunity to go and explore the village and oh wow it didn’t take me long, the Main Street probably runs for about a kilometre but has a few shops, a supermarket and places to eat.As I was walking down I noticed a small group of people following me, thinking nothing of it I carried on but eventually found myself at the end of the town. After turning around it turned out the group behind me had been other UK volunteers, ones that I’d actually recognised from photos Lucy had posted. As the town is pretty remote and doesn’t have a single thing for tourists this meant that the only white people in the place were the 12 UK volunteers and this random guy walking down the road, me. So no surprise that they were interested in who I was and why on earth I was in Nyimba. I told them my story and how everything was still a surprise and they seemed to think it was an excellent idea and we walked to the main building where they are based to meet the rest of the team. I was welcomed with open arms, everybody was so friendly and seemed glad I was there, they even invited me to the BBQ they were having in a few days. People were definitely sharing my excitement too looking forward to the moment Lucy would be coming back, still with no idea I was sitting in her meeting point at the time, that afternoon. After being so welcomed I felt such a good feeling about the place and my time and knew it would just be what I’d expected.A few hours later I’d heard that she was on her way around and my heart was racing, I set up a go pro and handed another person a camera to get this moment and it was truly one of the best experiences ever seeing her face with me standing there in the middle of Zambia. It was the reaction that I had wanted all along.Lucy took me to see her host family out here, they were very welcoming and the dad of the family proceeded to say he wanted to me to come around for breakfast and dinner the next day and to be with him for 8am, not wanting to be rude I accepted.I arrived at 8 and had a form of porridge with crushed peanuts inside, that really hit the spot and was definitely appreciated. As Lucy was at her placement all day he said he would take me out and show me things, I had a tour guide, perfect! We ended up driving around the village and he took me to his piece of land where he was growing things, it was a good day. For dinner we had chicken and nshima which is a sort of cornflour based food, it looks a lot like mash potato and to eat the entire meal with your hands.The next day came and I had received a message from Lucy’s host dad telling me that I wasn’t under any circumstance to stay at my hotel that day, that i’d paid for, as the group of volunteers were having a day of talks there. This is when everything started to take a turn but I brushed it off and went to go meet her dad as requested. He took me out in his car and made me pay for his fuel for the day which was rather outrageous seeing as I didn’t even want to be there. He dropped me off for some lunch at some restaurant and just kept saying over and over how I mustn’t visit the hotel at all at any cost.After a few hours of waiting around Lucy had finished and I got a chance to go and see her. She looked worried, she’d been speaking to the UK leader of the team out in Nyimba for VSO ICS and had been told that I needed to leave and wasn’t welcome any longer. If I didn’t go, Lucy’s place on the team would be compromised too and she would have to leave. It’s crazy to think a big organisation like this would blackmail somebody into doing something like this. The only reason being apparently it was against the code of conduct which it isn’t, we checked. I was heartbroken, I couldn’t comprehend how somebody could be so heartless, rude and downright nasty. I could understand if I was interrupting her time but at this point I’d seen her for about 3 hours over the space of a few days and to be quite honest the time when they are ‘working’ out here they are truly doing nothing at all, but that’s another story.I knew Lucy got weekends off and it was even the Zambian bank holiday on the Monday and Tuesday so I was looking forward to that. We hadn’t given an answer or my leaving as of yet and as it was the weekend but then the time we thought we might get together just deteriorated, I was told I wasn’t allowed at the BBQ or the socials and her time got conveniently occupied, the only day we got together was the Sunday and that day was truly perfect. We ended up going off the the stream just out of town, it’s super quiet and just a nice place to get away from things.Over those few other days the leader just kept nagging about my departure and turned my whole trip into just a bad experience of the place and VSO. I’d spoken to the other leaders who are Zambian and the UK and Zambian volunteers and they all had no problems with me being in the town. It’s now a week later and I’m sat in my hotel room about to go and book my bus out of here. I don’t want to ruin Lucy’s experience of this incredible time away. I just can’t understand what could be wrong about making somebody the happiest they’ve been in a long time.Indecisive coffee drinker and designer

Even before I got on a plane, I was already in love with the idea of flying. My dad would return home from business trips with a suit slinked over his Samsonite, a couple magazines in tow. I spent hours thumbing through the crinkled pages of his passport, guessing the national origin of visas and entry stamps. JFK-HKG, 747, 0600 — these were the symbols and secret codes of a world I dreamed of inhabiting.Those first few flights, I was spoiled to travel in my father’s company. I swelled with pride everytime we were greeted with a smile, bumped up to business class, and escorted into some swanky lounge. As a kid it was all the proof I needed that my dad was some kind of Of course that didn’t last. Just as I’d eventually have to come off his healthcare plan, so too would I have to take responsibility for my own travel arrangements. Still, despite entry-level Skyteam membership, travel had its enjoyable moments. Because I was already a veteran, I felt perfectly at peace in the lonely silence of strangers. In those dimly lim cabins I would reach for my Moleskine and Faber-Castell, writing pages of prose to comfort my restless teenage soul.Before long, I was flying out of the nest. Higher education and emancipation awaited me in the UK. But over a tearful goodbye to my parents at the security gate, for the first time, I found myself I’m not sure as to the exact moment travel lost its charm. No doubt it was sometime around my public humiliation at a Ryanair check-in counter, or when I was held at quarantine in Cairo airport during swine flu fever. Sure, I’ve amassed a good collection of cocktail-hour stories, but along the way there have been one too many 5am shuttles to Luton, one too many Christmas Eves spent in a hotel outside Schiphol.What I once considered “travel” has morphed from a symbol of aspirational freedom to a banal, oppressive routine. It’s no longer a choice, it’s a necessity of modern life. We should call it what it really is: Public transit. Commuting.And sure, I’m guilty of the usual snobbery of seeing a uniquely cherished experience “ruined” by the masses. I admit I’ll never be able to erase the image of a dozen middle-aged women in matching pink t-shirts, belting out “Build Me Up Buttercup” at 10 in the morning before a flight out of Newcastle. It’s like the disappointment of seeing your favorite band in concert, only to discover you hate the crowd of listeners around you. The inevitable fact is that as our modern lives become more mobile, our travel will become more menial. Thankfully, like George Clooney’s character showed us in In the end, I’ve learned it was always naïve of me to worship travel for it’s own sake. There is no magic rainbow at the end of the jetway — just a crowded room full of body odour and crying babies. There is nothing particularly exotic or glamorous about flying, and we shouldn’t fool ourselves to think so. Because it was never about the journey in the first place. It was always about the destination.Afghan-Italian-American. ROC→CDG→FLR→NCL→CDG→FLR→LGW→JFK→NCE→BRU→CPH→PRG→JFK…

No matter how many times I’ve been asked, the question always hit me by surprise. Growing up in America, I had been taught that inquiring on one’s religion was a social Not only immigrants, either, but locals in Egypt, Jordan, and Morocco, often during tense negotiations in the bazaar or over Black Label drinks at a dance-club open only to foreigners and the local one percent. Other times I just couldnt bear to break a poor old man’s heart by denying him this simple pleasure. It’s the same reason I always remark on the beauty of the local city in the taxi ride from the arrivals terminal to the city center, no matter how brutal its polluted, concrete facades. I sense a strange pride on their part that a foreign visitor, whom they assume is well educated and well off, appreciates their city, their religion, their way of life.It wasn’t until I left the States that I realized the benfits of picking and choosing my identity depending on the situation. While living in Italy as a teenager during the Bush (II) years, I had been told to avoid McDonalds’ and English-speaking groups lest they be bombed by terrorists. Ironically, the only harassment I faced was by overweight Italian bullies at my American high school in Florence, who called me I can only think of one other place where strangers have taken an abnormally high interest in my religion — Israel. They weren’t too happy about my last name, but thankfully no one asked about my allegiance to Islam. Rather, I was constantly prodded to provide my Semitic credentials in the nightclubs of Tel Aviv, where any conversation with a beautiful woman inevitably trailed to those three inquisitive words —I asked my non-Israeli, non-Jewish friend who had lived in the country for several years and, I imagined, enjoyed some degree of seductive success with the fairer half of Israel’s military. I told him I was uncomfortable with lying, and even if I did, wouldnt Israeli women figure out I wasn’t Jewish eventually? He cracked up and put his hand on my shoulder, shaking his head. In short, if I can manipulate the system just to get free falafel or to woo olive-skinned beauties, we should really reconsider how seriously we’re taking all of this stuff.Afghan-Italian-American.

Since the first conference way back in 1984, TED Talks have inspired us, captivated us, and given us something thought-provoking to watch over lunch. Here’s ten inspirational What do you learn when you sail around the world on your own? When solo sailor Ellen MacArthur circled the globe — carrying everything she needed with her — she came back with new insight into the way the world works, as a place of interlocking cycles and finite resources, where the decisions we make today affect what’s left for tomorrow. She proposes a bold new way to see the world’s economic systems: not as linear, but as circular, where everything comes around.Every seven years, designer Stefan Sagmeister closes his New York studio for a yearlong sabbatical to rejuvenate and refresh their creative outlook. He explains the often overlooked value of time off and shows the innovative projects inspired by his time in Bali.More and more people worldwide are living in countries not considered their own. Writer Pico Iyer — who himself has three or four “origins” — meditates on the meaning of home, the joy of traveling and the serenity of standing still.Wingsuit jumping is the leading edge of extreme sports — an exhilarating feat of almost unbelievable daring, where skydivers soar through canyons at over 100MPH. Ueli Gegenschatz talks about how (and why) he does it, and shows jawdropping film.Taryn Simon exhibits her startling take on photography — to reveal worlds and people we would never see otherwise. She shares two projects: one documents otherworldly locations typically kept secret from the public, the other involves haunting portraits of men convicted for crimes they did not commit.Explorer Ben Saunders wants you to go outside! Not because it’s always pleasant and happy, but because that’s where the meat of life is, “the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days.” Saunders’ next outdoor excursion? To try to be the first in the world to walk from the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again.Strapped to a jet-powered wing, Yves Rossy is the Jetman — flying free, his body as the rudder, above the Swiss Alps and the Grand Canyon. After a powerful short film shows how it works, Rossy takes the TEDGlobal stage to share the experience and thrill of flying.“Anything that is worth pursuing is going to require us to suffer, just a little bit,” says surf photographer Chris Burkard, as he explains his obsession with the coldest, choppiest, most isolated beaches on earth. With jawdropping photos and stories of places few humans have ever seen — much less surfed — he draws us into his “personal crusade against the mundane.”Nature’s beauty can be easily missed — but not through Louie Schwartzberg’s lens. His stunning time-lapse photography, accompanied by powerful words from Benedictine monk Brother David Steindl-Rast, serves as a meditation on being grateful for every day.This year, explorer Ben Saunders attempted his most ambitious trek yet. He set out to complete Captain Robert Falcon Scott’s failed 1912 polar expedition — a four-month, 1,800-mile round trip journey from the edge of Antarctica to the South Pole and back. In the first talk given after his adventure, just five weeks after his return, Saunders offers a raw, honest look at this “hubris”-tinged mission that brought him to the most difficult decision of his life.The world you have never seen!

by Nikita Kozlovski ∙ May 2015My earliest memories include crisscrossing the USSR by train with my grandma during one of her 5-city relatives-visiting tours across Siberia.

Stranger: “Where are you from?”Me: “Australia.”Stranger: “Oh okay… but where are you Me: “Australia.”Stranger: “But you look Asian…”This is a question that I have been asked at least once every time I have travelled abroad. This is not to show that I am especially well-travelled, but instead reveals how surprisingly uncommon the idea of a multi-cultural identity still is to a large number of people in the world. As someone who comes from a Chinese heritage family, yet born and raised in Australia, I have felt the influences of both Eastern and Western culture and values. My parents who are first generation immigrants from Shanghai, moved to Australia over 20 years ago in search of a different future. As with many children raised up from immigrant families, I have wondered before, “Which culture do I identify with?”. The answer is, as cheesy as it is, I am whatever I want to be.Australia is the place where I am most familiar with; the suburbs, the shops and the old friends. It represents a generally open-minded national mindset and a “laid back” everyday attitude. I often forget how taken-for-granted this relaxedness is, compared to the rest of the world where something like going to university is a given option, not a big class barrier. Aussies who are keen to help strangers when overseas and seen as overly-trusting, may really just want to give people the benefit of the doubt. Those that speak directly or are upfront about things may be seen as rude, when in fact directness is a sign of respect and closeness in Australia.China on the other hand is the place that I am most intrigued about; the history the culture and the rapid changes that are underway. China is so full of opportunity, if you know how where to look and how to make use of it. For me, unlike Australia, the nation and its people may at times seem a little less approachable but once you move past the superficial level, there is a lot more you can appreciate. Young couples who live with their parents and are seen as lacking independence, may really just hold respect for elders very highly and have a more family-oriented value system.One experience with a man on a train in China I had last year made me ponder about the issue of having to identify with one culture or the other. My friends (also Australian born Chinese) and I were conversing in English when a stranger interrupted, “You are Chinese. Chinese people should speak Chinese”. My friend swiftly responded in Chinese, “We are not Chinese, we are Australian”, to which the stranger held a stunned silence.Although this is an extreme example, unlike the man on the train, I do not see the need to align with only one national identity. Media theorists like Sharmani Patricia Gabriel try to give us a modern understanding of diaspora by highlighting the importance of understanding identity through the individual and not necessary through the origin. My understanding of identity is that it should be fluid and adaptable according to circumstance. For example, when in a setting predominantly consisting of one cultural background, identifying yourself as the other may be advantageous. Though on the other hand, aligning with the predominant culture may allow you to assimilate more easily and more relatable to others of that background.Cunningham and Sinclair also note that migrants, especially second and third generation migrants, are decreasingly victims of their background who are torn between cultures, but increasingly agents of their own circumstances. Hence in this day and age, as people and cultures transform, as we broaden our horizons and absorb different cultures, it’s less about being tied to one culture but becoming culturally aware to become a global citizen. Travelling, learning different languages, making cultural faux pas, accidentally offending people and learning from those mistakes, are all part of growing with cultures.

At this point in life, I recently graduated from the hellish paradise MIT, one month ago, and have been home since. Home is superb, life’s much slower paced than in Boston and with nothing to do, I’ve been able to really appreciate the love and affection that surrounds me in Princeton, NJ. Over the course of the month I’ve written a few letters, caught up on some TV episodes, spent time fooling around with my friends and family, made exactly one playlist, and have taken a complete hiatus from all things technical.While at home I live a pretty normal small town life, I occasionally go to the beach, play sports and go the gym, enjoy family trips, and perform debaucherous acts with my friends. All this is great and I wouldn’t give it up for anything, but I’ve started to learn its not as fulfilling as I once thought. I chatted my friends dad the other day about initial TDMA phone systems and got quite an unexpected kick out of thinking about how these systems work. Its truly rejuvenating, and I think that this hiatus has given me the perfect kick in the ass to love all things technical, so I’d definitely advise it if you feel like you’re breaking down.Next I’m taking this break from all things technical to a whole new level by traveling for a month and a half before moving to San Francisco. I’ll quickly outline my travels here, leaving New York on June 30th, 2015 for Abu Dhabi, where I will stop and spend time with my uncle and his family for 3 days. I’ve never been to the UAE, but I’m excited to see the modern desert cities of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, go sand duning in the desert and to delve into one of the truest culinary capitals of the world.From there I head to India, I stop in Mumbai for a day to see family friends, and am then off to the mountain city of Leh, located in Ladakh. Leh is the northern corner of India, it sits at 11,500 ft altitude, higher than I’ve ever been before, and is set between mountain ranges and historic Buddhist monasteries while also being surrounded by alpine desert. I know there are a bunch of tours and hikes that I’ll decide upon once I get there, so the trip to Leh is open-ended, but hopefully inspirational and magnificent. I’ll live simply, enjoy the pace and the scenery, eat some vegetables, and hopefully find myself in a state of zen.Following my week in Leh, I’ll travel to Singapore for about 5 days to see my mom’s sister and her husband, they’re recent expats but always interested in becoming a part of their current community, so I’m sure I’ll have a blast. Then its off to Bangalore for a few days, then I’ll take the sleeper train to Kottayam, its always a culinary experience and the train ride is gorgeous while pretty uncomfortable. While in Kerala I’ll hang with the fam, grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles, and spend some quality time with them. Hopefully multiple of my college friends who’re also in India at the same time will get a chance to come visit, I think they’d really dig it.After that my mom, uncle and I will make the trip to Rajasthan and Jaisalmer for a desert camel safari and to see some of India’s most beautiful temples. This side of India is completely foreign to me, my family is South Indian and dang proud of it, so it’ll be like a different world for all of us, but it should be quite an experience! After that I’ll swing back to Bombay and then head out to Zurich/Stuttgart to stop in and catch up with an old high school friend for 3 days. We’ll plan out a few hikes, skinny-dip in Lake Kostanz, the biggest in Germany, and probably not stop drinking beers the entire time I’m there, that’s what you do in Germany right??Next is a 15 hour direct flight to San Francisco, sounds dreadful, followed by three days where I need to prepare to start work/ find a house/ get a car. Wish me luck! I’ll keep posting as I go alongAdditionally, I think this will help but its my packing list for the trip.Note here that I really wanted to bring my DJI Phantom 3 Advanced drone, but customs would probably confiscate a cool gizmo like this and the drone wouldn’t be able to fly at 12,000 ft in Leh due to an inability to generate enough lift due to far lower air density at those altitudes.Wish me luck! Also just in case you haven’t seen this video of me at my finest check it out, its hysterical.PS. As I go thru this trip I will take pictures, provide insight, and try to document costs and awesome things I did.Engineer, Computer Scientist, Traveler, Artist. Blogging on varied topics.

What is it about train travel that is so calming? I could stare at the Italian countryside for hours and never tire of the ample greenery, the rows of brick roofs that pepper the fields, the hints of yellow and gold peeking through to remind us that autumn is near. The biggest, puffiest clouds top off this incredibly scenic view and once in a while, a natural body of water catches me by surprise. For once in my life, I have nothing else to do but absorb what’s before me to the sounds of Tom Misch coming through my headphones. It feels so good.Milan was short and sweet, which in my opinion was just perfect. My first hostel experience was very positive. I shared a large room with three women much older than me but we got along just fine. The bistrot attached to the hostel was fun and quirky, the staff friendly, and the rooms comfy as well as clean. Plus, who wouldn’t enjoy free farm-to-table dinner buffets and breakfasts, a complimentary drink at the bar upon check in, and strong wifi? I would definitely recommend Madama Hostel if anyone needs a place to stay in Milan.I spent the afternoon visiting the Duomo (Milan Cathedral and the terrace). I regretted not purchasing tickets online because the ‘queues’ were so long but I was on vacation so I forced myself to practice patience. Ended up getting the Duomo pass because I wanted to get up to the terrace which provided a pretty cool view of the piazza from above. It was up here that I made my first friend abroad. Being the dork that I am, I Snapchatted myself walking down marble steps with commentary and a woman named Madeleine nearby asked if I was American because clearly I sounded like one. We hit it off immediately with ease and soon enough we made plans to meet up at night for dinner and a club with her coworkers. Life is full of such funny coincidences and I’m thankful she stopped to talk to me because we had a blast, especially after discovering that we both deeply loved electronic dance music and many similar niche sub-genres.If I were more responsible, I probably would have abstained from drinking and slept early to account for the jet lag but instead I did the total opposite by pitching in with my new friends for a table at a club in Milan. It came out to only 45 Euro per person (crazy right?!), which would never ever be even a remote possibility in New York. The table next to us was full of model type females and their pretty boy friends/toys. They added a ton of value to our night by being so entertaining. The kissy face selfies and asking the boy toys to film them ‘candidly’ dancing, giggling, being all around fab were the highlights.At around 3:30AM, Madeleine and I split off to head home. It was raining most of the late evening, which normally would’ve been such a pain in the ass but there was something really romantic and soothing about the city in all its wet, cold, and dark glory. Or maybe I just became a raging optimist since I’m on vacation. Whatever it was, it was alright with me.I woke up slightly hungover this morning and packed my stuff up in a frenzy to leave. Hopefully I didn’t lose anything… but you never know with me. Purchased a sandwich of cured meats and cheese and water before almost getting lost trying to find the Frecciabianca train I needed for Venezia. Took a sip of my water and almost choked upon finding out it was carbonated. I don’t understand why Europeans dig their fizzy water so much but it actually helped kill the nausea, something I am making note of for next time I’m in desperate need.Up next, Venice! Hoping the skies stay clear, it’s been a bit gloomy since I landed in Italy and you know I need those perfect Instagram photos.Big data consultant 

Over the past 10 years, I’ve lived and worked in at least ten different cities in three different countries, visiting many more. I’ve met hundreds of people along the way. So when a friend from Dallas recently posed a simple question, it grabbed my attention:As I turned it over in my head, I realised that trying to pick just one pithy line to sum up such an inherently broad experience as travel was virtually impossible.So here’s my top ten.These thoughts continue to guide me, both on my travels and more generally through life.

I find myself making lists of to-do’s before jetting off to find unspoken wonder and beer. After having confirmed that my bank cards will work where I’m traveling about a 23 times, and making sure that I wrote my name correctly on my boarding pass — more times than I care to admit — I go through my things and take inventory, not of what I have, but what I’ve lost. There’s always that one piece of clothing that falls victim to the proverbial sock dimension. In this case it was my swim trunks. RIP camo green Under Armour swim trunks, I hardly knew yee. Literally. I only wore them like 3 times.Once that list is done I restock on the essentials. Being the ever wandering individual I find that I need to restock on several crucial items, some of them far more dire than others, but essential none-the-less. To those unspoken heroes of my 50L pack I dedicate this piece to you.These are my offerings and prayers. I hope that you gain more followers.

My friend, Brent, shared a quote from St. Augustine, “The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.”Most travel articles that people send my way these days only mention people who quit their jobs to fulfill their lifelong (Imagine a world, empowered by our global connectedness, where there A good place to start is finding relatively inexpensive places to live along your travels, which there’s a great resource site called Truth is, the future is already here for many people. We’re in an age, the information age, where the playing field is being leveled with relatively free access to top-tier online education; from Ivy-League MOOCs to platforms like Udemy. If you’re not taking advantage of these resources, you are the only one holding yourself back.Few people, if any, stay with one company for a lifetime anymore. It may sound scary for those few still clinging on to a false sense of job security but whether you like it or not even companies are embracing and expecting a more transient workforce. The business landscape is changing too fast for companies to allow for stagnant minds. New billion dollar enterprises that didn’t exist a decade ago are popping up at ever faster rates, and in-turn people will flock to where the next big opportunity is.The beauty of it all is, people have more freedom to move around, and companies can get fresh blood and fresh ideas. The focus for companies is no longer having long-term employees that are highly experienced with their one company, but highly experienced employees with well-rounded, self-educated, industry-wide, and cross-industry skills.Start thinking along these lines and you’ll begin to open your mind to the possibilities of traveling and P.S. There’s another reason why I never advocate quitting work. If you know me well, you also know I find the general idea of retirement, sold to the masses, abhorrent. It is a lie, a false promise, and a man-made disease.Why is retirement a lie? Retirement was invented in the 1900s to oust people who held their positions for too long and had too much power; plus you weren’t expected to live long enough to collect much pension anyway. With the advancement of medicine and lifespans, I find it absolutely insane that the retirement age hasn’t even shifted. I was disappointed to see the well-respected Harvard professor, Daniel Gilbert, who wrote one of my favorite books Why do you think Social Security is falling apart? Why is it unsustainable? Why am I glad to be greeted by elderly people at Target? And why do people find that disgraceful? I find it insulting that our society sees aging people as weak, useless, and helpless. In many other societies around the world, aging people are celebrated, actively engaged in the community, and not cast aside by society to go die quietly. My 108 year-old great-grandmother carried herself, fed herself, and was celebrated for her contributions to her community until the day she died.The secret to success that I’ve read from a lot of successful people is inline with my favorite JFK quote, “Why is retirement a man-made disease? If you’re living, breathing, and capable of contributing, you need to. It’s just how the world turns. It’s healthy for you physically, mentally, and emotionally. If we all know that staying active and engaged is one of the secrets of living longer, why the hell would we promote retirement? Just because we’ve been doing something for the past 100 or so years doesn’t mean it’s a great idea. There is no shame in working until the day you die, it used to be honorable. Hell, it still is honorable.I consider myself a successful business owner and entrepreneur. I love being a designer, and a musician on the side. (XenonSupply, CraveLab, Fickle  Flasking)

Roadtrip Experience Project for Impact is a generative travel project that brings Ideators, Change-makers, Social Entrepreneurs  Designers on a roadtrip to create impact through social innovation.This year RTXIMPACT pilot project will see 12 handpicked individuals travel through rough terrains of the mighty Himalayas to Miyar Valley in Lahaul, Himachal Pradesh - a region that remains disconnected from the entire world for 9 months every year. These Change-makers will act as catalysts for inspiring a Global Design Challenge through their observations in Miyar Valley.Expect brainstorms, engaging with locals, staying in homestay, off-roading to one of the most inaccessible region of India, using design-thinking principle to create innovation and meeting some really talented individuals.Miyar is a very remote and fairly inaccessible valley at the extreme western corner of the large district of Lahaul and Spiti, in the state of Himachal Pradesh in India. Miyar Nala, as it is often known, is an exceptionally long valley, with the Miyar River running down into the Chandra Bhaga River at Udaipur over 50 kms below the Miyar Glacier. This glacier stretches a further 24 km up to the high Kang La Jot (5468m) and beyond it to Zanskar valley in Ladakh. Above a narrow gorge at the bottom of the valley, the Miyar Nala widens to support twelve small farming villages at altitudes between 9,300 and 11,500 feet, with about 3,000 current inhabitants in total. Most of the people of the Nala are Buddhists and there is a small gompa (monastery) at the village of Urgos.Cultivation of grains and peas ceases in the valley at nearly 12,000 feet, where the beautiful Himalayan meadows begin. Here Gaddis (shepherd tribe) graze their flocks in the late summer. There is also a much-loved high-altitude cricket-ground with a sensational view of 15 or more snow-covered peaks. The meadows and the steep rocky side valleys feature the full variety of Himalayan high-altitude flora, which can take some serious clambering to find. At Phalpu, the bottom of the Miyar Glacier, the audacious can bathe in Kesariyong Chu, seven icy sacred pools.On all sides snow-covered peaks abound, many of them unclimbed. Some of the most beautiful and most jagged ones are in Chhudong valley. You can only see these after a stiff hike up the side valley above Phalpu to the base of dominant Castle Peak and then perhaps up the incredible Chhudong/Tawa Glacier to Neverseen Tower at nearly 6,000m. Starting in Miyar valley, the trek to Kang La (pass) involves traversing over the 24 km long Miyar glacier and a climb up to 5450m. This pass forms the route to cross over into the Zanskar Valley which lies north of the Great Himalayan range.Travel Architects — Travel Partners — Whitemagic AdventureMentors — Shanti Mohan, CEO  Founder @LetsVentureView more Photos : Experience Designer, Founder 

Moroccans are still reeling from the crackdowns that followed Arab Spring protest movements, but international support has helped Moroccans to continue to mobilize reform movements. You may not recognize this from a week-long visit to tourist areas, but Moroccan community organizations provide essential services, healthcare, community and cultural support for LGBT Moroccans nationwide, despite economic and political setbacks — a development I’ve witnessed over 20 years traveling and working in Morocco.As an influential journalist and a rights activist, you must know that without ongoing grassroots collaboration and a clearly defined agenda, a boycott may isolate the very people you intend to support. “If people there truly want to veer in an ugly new direction, I suppose that’s up to them,” you say — but without meaningful representation and opportunities for community engagement, it isn’t. Do you really intend to cut off Morocco’s reformers and LGBT community from the broader global community of people working toward human rights and recognition? Who do you intend a travel boycott to serve, and whose interests are you sacrificing toward that goal? These are questions I hope you’ll answer in a follow-up post, and in our continued offline conversations on the subject.write/edit/curate content on travel/food/drink/art/design for Lonely Planet, Airbnb, Detour, BBC, Fest300, Time Inc mags, sundry others

I have no idea what it’s like to travel as a man. Do strangers ask if you’re married? Do they then ask if your sister is married? Is there a particular dress code (apart from the questionable facial hair most male travellers seem to support)? Do you ever feel vulnerable around the opposite sex? All I know is it’s different to travelling as a woman.As I hauled my backpack out of Dad’s car at Heathrow airport, the last thing he said to me was “Don’t do anything too stupid”. My journey began with a lot of unspecific safety advice, but this particularly stuck in my head. I was leaving to journey from Cape Town to Nairobi — armed with flights in and out, but no particular plans or bookings.Safety is an obvious concern when you leave with an unknown itinerary, but heading for the hills is particularly worrying when other people consider you to be somewhat chaotic.My experience of travelling Africa wasn’t a bad one, but I do think it was gendered. It’s far from the UK, where things are by-and-large equal, and where the most hassle women can expect on a day-to-day basis is heckles from a bold builder, or a Rude Boy trying to sell you weed; abroad, you have to adapt.As my travel buddy Becca and I stepped into the big, local market in Lusaka, Zambia, I had the impression that westerners were a novel sight. It was mayhem. I was wearing a long patterned skirt and a t-shirt covering my shoulders. Becca wore shorts. Before we had had time to take stock of the dried caterpillars, smoked fish, beans and large metal carts loaded with cassava being wheeled at breakneck speeds down crowded streets, a colourfully dressed Zambian woman approached us.“Cover up your legs or they will rip your shorts off” were her only words.Almost as soon as I had arrived I realised Becca had made a catastrophic clothing mistake. A crowd of Zambians gathered as we made a beeline for the chitenge stalls (local fabric worn as skirts), and women and men cheered and heckled as Becca was dressed for market by the stall owner. Even after she had donned her chitenge there were shouts of “I like your skirt” and “Muzungu!” (“white skin”).We wandered off into the teeming mass of people to see what else we could find. Before long, we accrued a guide, and were soon sat having rice and beans in a quiet alcove away from the main market with some local women. I had always known that certain countries would require conservative dress, and it was probably quite naïve to think that wouldnt be the case in Zambia. The women explained that when women dress like westerners they get as much — even more — hassle than westerners do. I didn’t need to be told twice.As we progressed — from South Africa, to Zimbabwe, to Zambia, to Malawi, to Tanzania, to Kenya — I realised clothing wasn’t really the only detrimental part of my experience as women in African countries. Travelling as a woman was challenging because, apart from larger cities, public spaces were seemingly almost exclusively male. Each and every café we went to in the smaller towns of Tanzania was crammed to bursting with men, and on a particularly alarming occasion in Zimbabwe, we discovered the male gigolo scene in the local sports bar (no, not like that).In the countries that we visited — bar South Africa — African women just didn’t seem to go out in the same way men did. Whenever we went looking for a bar that wasn’t in the hostel, or a place to eat off the beaten track, the women were serving and the men socialising. This wasn’t a particular problem in terms of safety, but it did change the dynamic of who seemed to belong in certain situations. It made me beg the question: where do the women go?The practicalities of getting around were also frustratingly different. My main mission whilst undertaking my journey was to do so by using only public transport. This meant buses, trains, ferries, bike taxis, motorbikes and the dreaded matatu. Finding buses wasn’t difficult. Not only would people fall over themselves to get you on their form of transport, they would often lie to you to make you do so. This was probably not a symptom of being female, but the sheer frustration upon meeting male hitchhikers who travel basically for free — seemingly by merely sticking their thumb out firmly in the road — definitely made me wish I was just a bit more macho and that the risks weren’t quite so obvious.The thought of heading to an unknown location with an unknown driver was daunting for obvious reasons. Every foreign traveller we met that was using buses had a different story about how they had either been overcharged unknowingly, or taken eight hours to do a two hour journey (often to hilarious effect). It seemed to me that the idiom “ignorance is bliss” more or less described my attitude to hitchhiking. The less I thought about it, the happier I was. Buses presented merely “known unknowns” whereas hitchhiking seemed to be the elusive “unknown unknown” for scaredy-cat female travellers like myself.Ultimately, the thing I came to rely on with public transport was that if you were female, people either wanted your phone number or wanted to look after you. The former were predominantly men, the latter predominantly women. After one particularly hairy journey from Zomba to Mulanje in Malawi, my backpack went missing.Mob mentality is an amazing thing, and my new network of Malawian friends returned my bag of dirty clothes to me relatively unscathed. Eventually, after arriving at my destination, alone, in the pitch black, I wondered what it would be like if nobody had tried to help me.The time I spent travelling with boys undoubtedly changed my perspective of the travel gender divide. An ill-advised week spent with an Australian I had met weeks before showed me how difficult it could be. Locals wanted most negotiations to go through him, and generally they did.When you travel with men it’s harder to get people to talk to you. In that week, during the time I spent by myself, one person I’d asked for directions on the street tracked down my hostel room and left a note with his phone number at reception. That definitely wouldn’t have happened with a man by my side. I thought it was quite sweet, if a little ominous; my companion described it as “stalkerish”.My flight out of Nairobi was the last piece of proof I needed that it was a different world out there for female travellers. I was headed to Lebanon, one of the more progressive Middle Eastern countries. During a 10-hour lay over in Muscat I blagged my way into the first class lounge after losing my phone, and spent the evening drinking free gin and tonics with a British expat. The idea of being a “damsel in distress” was not one I considered good for furthering the feminist cause, but eventually made me realise how much more difficult that journey could have been had I not been able to rely on the kindness of strangers.Like Find Writer.

발리는 처음이다. 여러 동남아 도시를 여행했지만 발리는 신혼여행으로 가야한다는 사람들의 고정관념에 붙잡혀 그간 엄두를 내지 못했던 곳이다.몇년전 부턴가. 발리를 가고 싶다는 생각이 지속적으로 들었다. 기회만 보고 있었다고나 할까? 올해 나는 마음을 먹었다. 가자 발리. 초기에는 혼자 가고자 하는 마음으로 계획을 잡았다. 그러던중 한명의 동반자가 생긴다. 우연치 않게 친한 형이 발리로 가는것에 흥쾌히 동참의사를 밝혔기 때문이다. 이런저런 이야기 끝에 우린 5월 발리행 티켓을 끊었다.발리의 첫인상은 어두웠다. 밤이었기 때문이지만 상상과는 사뭇 달랐다고나 할까.진짜 발리는 다음날 부터 시작되었다. 아침에 눈을 뜨면서 느낀 발리의 햇살은 왠지 기분이 좋아지는 느낌이었다. 밥에 약속한 대로 우린 조식을 먹으러 호텔 식당으로 향했다.식당에서 바다가 보인다!!! 깜짝놀랐다. 밤에 도착했을때 이 호텔이 바다와 붙어있다라는 생각을 못했기 때문이다.우린 식사를 시작하는순간 한번 더 놀란다. 음식이 너무 맛있었다. 인도네시안 푸드가 별로라는 지인들의 말을 들은터라 기대를 하지 않았는데 이건 왠일. 정말 맛이 있지 않은가!나시고랭. 미고랭. 신선한 과일과 정말 맛있는 감자튀김. 나중에 느낀것이지만 음식에 감자튀김이 매우 자주 등장한다.자 이제 밖으로 나가볼까.발리 꾸따 해변이다. 시원하면서 뭔가 따뜻한 느낌이다. 파도는 써핑에 최적화 되어있다. 꾸따 해변은 호주 사람들이 많이 온다고 한다. 실제로 호주 사람을 심심치 않게 만날 수 있다. (아니 정말 많이 만날 수 있다)조금 걷다보면 몸이 뜨거워 진다. 물론 맨발로 걷다보면 발 껍질이 까질듯 한데 그늘에 가면 바로 식힐 수 있다.이제 진짜 몸을 식히러 가자.호텔에 돌아와 수영장에 가서 클럽샌드위치를 시켰다. 물론 인도네시아 맥주 빈땅과 한께 말이다. 빈땅은 인도네시아 사람들이 매우 사랑하는 인도네시아 맥주다. 시원한 맥주와 클럽샌드위치를 먹으며 수영을 즐기는 오후는 행복감 그 자체이다. 우리가 묵었던 그랜드 인나 쿠따 호텔은 총 3개의 수영장을 보유하고 있는데 크진 않지만 만족스러울만한 수영장이다. 뜨거운 오후는 이렇게 수영장과 함께 보냈다. 앞으로도 계속…저녁에 인도네시아 자카르타에서 반가운 친구가 왔다. 친구의 도움으로 우린 진수성찬(?)을 먹게 된다. 씨푸드를 곁들인 저녁 밥상이다. 쿠따에서 가장 번화한 거리 뽀삐스 거리 중앙에 있는 코피팟 레스토랑이다. 여러 여행 책자에도 많이 소개되어 있는 곳이기도 하다.푸짐하진 않지만 나름 넉넉한 인도네시안 푸드 저녁이었다.우린 이 저녁과 빈땅과 함께 많은 이야기와 시간을 보냈다. 그리고 자정 즈음에 뽀삐스 거리 중앙에 자리잡은 클럽을 방문했지만 호주인들의 꽉찬 크러빙에 밀려 금새 다시 나와 호텔로 향했다.호텔로 돌아오는 길에 빈땅과 김맛나는 과자를 사왔는데 이게 또 별비였다.맥주 한캔과 조우하다 내일 조식을 위해 취침모드로 돌입했다.It is all that I have an interest. The variety of its design, beautiful cars, always an interesting journey, and delicious food, and other beautiful things.

I’ve been to Brazil so many times in the last two years, that I accidentally learned Portuguese.Okay, I took some lessons and I really like languages, but my accelerated learning took place on those various trips.Yes, I’m one of those annoying guys that checks in at EWR, TLV, GRU, and business lounges on a regular basis. Before you close out the window however, note that I’ve pointed out But it’s been a great time and as Drake said I’ve learned quite a bit over the last two years. And most of it has been pretty random. So here it is, a collection of notes of all the random goodness I’ve learned while crisscrossing the globe.I’ve been on a West Coast Sabbatical for about three weeks. And I’ve worn the same shorts and the same pair of jeans for the duration of the time. Outside of my gym gear, I’ve pretty much stuck to the same 3 or 4 articles of clothing. And it happens every trip. Whether I pack 6 or 12 shirts, it doesn’t matter. I’ll wear half. No matter how “minimalist” we are, we always err on the side of caution and pack extra.So if you’re checking luggage you’re either not very efficient, new at traveling or you’re bringing sweet gifts for your international co-workers.On one hand it’s like “oh cool, we have built a vessel that can travel three thousand miles in only 6 hours, how amazing is that?”But on the other hand, airports make you realize that people are really bad at going to the bathroom.Let’s call airports a “draw” for humanity.When I live in Spain, my European friends would tell me “I’ll send you a missed call when I’m at your flat and we will leave to dinner.” Send me a missed call? Phone plans are very expensive in other countries. So to communicate and to avoid spending precious minutes, people will call you and hang up to avoid being charged. And because the price of plans is high for locals in other countries, they rely heavily on messaging apps. So get used to it and get WhatsApp. Or, be ready to get new Facebook friends to stay in touch via Messenger.No test. No class. You just go to the grocery store, get some eggs, some tortillas, oh yea and a license to operate a motor vehicle. Just keep that in mind.Staying in someone’s house, in a neighborhood gives you a better pulse of the city. Hotels are nice, and if you’re traveling for work, they’re probably really nice. But in hotels you’re never really “off”. They’re big, superficial and extravagant; not exactly that authentic, local feel you were looking for. Unless you’re in the Emirates.AirBnBs are closer to the real thing and most are located in vibrant, fun neighborhoods.I was in a cab leaving the airport going into Rome. My cab driver wasn’t very friendly. But I wasn’t going to miss the chance to make a new friend. I simply asked “Roma? Totti?” The names of one of the local teams and their star player. His eyes lit up he began talking about the upcoming season. Our conversation was basically me asking him about random Italian players and him responding “bastardo”. Unless I named a Roma player. In which case he smiled.Learn a bit about the local team, wherever you go. You’ll get new friends and immediately have something in common with the local populace.I love making friends and talking to people. Especially on an airplane. I’m like a curious 12 year old. But even I know that once your seat mate takes out their headphones, it’s time to make like a tree and shut upThis is a great tip I Your arrival at the airport is the only thing you can control. After that you’re arrival time is out of your hands and in the control of pilots, customs and taxi cabs. You’ll already be traveling for 8–12 hours (or more). What’s an extra 30 minutes to make sure you’re not rushed? Get to the airport early, be relaxed as you go through security. And if you did get there waaaaay too early, well you can catch up on a book or call your mother. All things you can’t do if you’re praying to the Newark Gods that the security line moves fast because you overslept and are now running late.It took me two years to finally go to a meeting in LatAm that started on time. I wasn’t surprised. After all, one of my Brazilian colleagues told me that in Brazil “…it’s polite to be 30 minutes late.” Unless you live in Northern Europe or one of the Anglo countries, time moves slower in most parts of the world. It’s cyclical. If you tell someone in Latin America to meet you at the bar at 10pm what they hear is “meet me between 10pm and 1am.” Being an American, I found this very frustrating my first few times in LatAm. But that’s the culture. And you can complain or adapt. Me? I don’t mind it anymore. As long as everyone is on the same page, the meeting can start on time or two hours late. .I used to joke around that jetlag was for pregnant women and small children. Definitely not the case. And while jet lag is very real, you can indeed curb it. Regular exercise and not boozing are the two easiest things you can do to get yourself acclimated to a new time zone. I spend my first day anywhere trying to adapt to the local schedule. So even if I’m dead tired at 5pm, I’ll try to stay up until 9ish or so. Unless it’s the weekend. In which case…it’s a game time decision.Sometimes, it may even be worth it to pony up the $50 to get into a business lounge. One time I was stuck in Dallas for 16 hours. I was coming off a 9 hour flight from Santiago and snow in Dallas was preventing me from boarding my last leg to SFO. I was tired, smelly and uncomfortable. I’m not one to splurge on myself, but those $50 I spent for the United lounge left me a new man. A nap, a shower and a change of clothes perked me right back up. Best 50 bucks I ever spent. Now I have status Look, don’t be THAT tourist. The one that gets frustrated when the locals don’t speak the tourists native tongue. Don’t be a dick. Learn a few words of the local tongue and make an effort. One of my co-workers makes it a point to learn key phrases before every trip and he gets shit done, the hotel staff love him and he gets us faster service at restaurants. Just make an effort, show that you care.Speaking of tourism, there is a misconception that Parisians are rude. It reminds me of a line from the show Justified.Basically, Paris is one of the most popular cities for tourism. So every day, Parisian service staff and locals have annoying and rude tourists (mostly Americans, sorry) asking for things. Imagine every day having inconsiderate people asking you for stuff. It becomes burdensome. Parisians…if you show some effort and some consideration are really nice, just like anyone else in the world.I once stopped a man in Montmartre, apologized for speaking French like a Spanish cow, and asked him if he could point me to the subway. He laughed, I laughed, he gave me directions, I said merci and we went our way.I was getting really frustrated with a LatAm Agency and their director. As I was fuming to one of my mentors he told me “…she’s just like you. She wants to do good work and be happy. So have patience and if you get frustrated, just think of that.”When I lived in Spain, one of my new Catalan friends told me about how his dream was to drive up and down the PCH in California. I thought to myself “really? I just did that last week. What’s so special?”But my dream was to visit Barcelona and his, a Barcelona native, was to visit my home state. No matter where you’re from, we all long to see something new and to step out of your comfort zone. You could be in Paris wanting to see Modesto or in Modesto wanting to see Paris.The world is huge, but after traveling for so long, it’s really not. We all want to be happy, we all want to see new things and we all want to fulfilled. And that’s nice. Now. Back to New York.trying to make sense of my culture, my history and ultimately, myself. negocios 

Hospitality is a sector historically shrouded in a veil of mystique. Made timeless by the silver screen and yet in constant flux with the trends of the day, hotels have always managed to evoke our imaginations and draw in our desires to belong. And so it pains me to call foul on such a wondrous facet of the tourism industry. With all its luster and seduction, the world of hospitality has failed to grasp at what millennials — the seemingly elusive yet categorically courted group of which I happen to be a part of — are all about.First, allow me to explain why there is such a flurry in the travel industry’s efforts to attract loyalty among millennials. Loosely defined as those born between the 1980s and the early 2000s, Generation Y boasts a projected peak population of 81.1 million, a number almost six million higher than the baby boomer generation (according to the U.S. Census Bureau). With regards to spending power, the group accounts for $200 billion in actual spend and $500 billion in influence. And it doesn’t stop there. Just two years from now, the group’s spending power will rise from its current rate of 9% to 40%, and millennials will emerge as king spender.With regards to travel, the evolution of millennials’ role in the industry fits these same patterns. Gen Y currently represents 32% of U.S. travelers, and will grow to constitute more than half of all travelers within 10 years. Collectively, they take more overnight trips, will spend more on travel services and are the driving force behind growth of the U.S. travel industry. In turn,here is plenty at stake as Generation Y peaks in 2017 — and the deluge of brand launches and rebranding efforts catering to millennials is a clear sign that the hospitality world has taken note.In surveying the trends of perks, messaging and other developments meant to lasso in Gen Y loyalty, the composite portrait is one of a spoiled tech junkie never more than a few feet from a yoga mat, consuming an endless torrent of inspirational content and craft beer. I must admit: a mild case of generational insecurity rode up my spine as I typed these words. Yes, I am indeed using my Macbook at a co-working space while drinking crop-to-cup cold brew coffee. Yet I can also admit that while these facts delineate certain lifestyle choices (a few of which can be extrapolated as generational trends), these choices by no means define my principles or account for where I will spend my money. These traits are the trappings of our generations, not the values that define us.In a classic case of herd mentality, the world’s leading hospitality brands have accepted this caricature of Gen Y as if by consensus, and the resulting products represent a tragic miss. A cursory read through press releases and interviews with executives of emerging brands yield indistinguishable rhetoric, leading to a near uniformity among the properties debuted. Some essential amenities, such as free WiFi and healthy food options, are surely appreciated by all. Yet similar layouts (open lobbies and communal space), design (contemporary and cheeky), and programming (TED-style talks, board games) will play the role of an ersatz to the properties that will be able to appeal to the generation’s zeitgeist. And the solution to this quandary is very simple, and fittingly, can be found in a 2009 TED talk by Simon Sinek: Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which puts self-actualization at the top of the pyramid, is by no means a tool created to explain millennials. In fact, the theory was established in 1943, long before the birth of the millennials . Yet Generation Y chooses to vocalize a fundamental need for purpose and meaning in how they choose to lead their lives with. No longer will they settle for any work that pays the bills and wait for retirement to live life to its fullest. Millennials demand travel, experience and authenticity. Moreover, in a world that is increasingly fragile due to the environmental footprint of humans and the economic footprint of consumerism, millennials have developed a keener interest in impact and sustainability. Fittingly, they demand the same proactive attitude from any business that seeks their patronage. Impactful organizations that know how to tell their story correctly are those that excel. Warby Parker, While free WiFi and on-demand wellness products are great, they are simply tools millennials use while on their purpose-fueled path. The generation that will soon be the heaviest spender in travel is one that holds its potential vendors under the scrutiny of a values-driven lens. Sure, with the right amenities and price, a hotel may earn tactical wins in the daily struggle for heads in bed. Yet from a strategic point of view, only the brand whose values align with those of Generation Y will be able to build a true base of loyalty to reach the top of old Maslow’s pyramid.

I’ve had a travel file for a long time — and it sounds like it’s just like yours — in that whenever I hear of some place interesting to go or something interesting to do, I chuck it in there. In fact it’s called ‘Vacations and things to do’. And I use it just like yours — do a search in there whenever I am going to that place, or look back at it for inspiration for vacations. So yep — I’m with you — love my inspirational travel file!Born near Birmingham, UK. Live in California. Work at Google.

Many people, at least in the US, are only accustomed to taking vacations, and this may be the case for their entire lives. This is because of in the US, we get a measly 2 weeks of vacation per year or less. This is often used for visiting families or a short vacation inside the US.When you only get so little time off, I had only ever taken vacations before starting the In addition, you can easily live very well while traveling at a budget of $50/day or less, everything included. So how do you keep costs low? A few simple tricks. First, keep lodging costs low by staying in hostels, airbnbs booked ahead of time, couchsurfing, and/or staying with friends when possible. Stay further out from city centers, you can always bike or take public transit in. Cook your own food — it’s easy, healthy, and saves a boatload of money. And keep frivolous tourist costs low. Seeing every museum and church and climbing every tower in each city you visit is sure to drain your account for little to no actual value. It’s pretty likely that you’ll never remember that museum or view over the city a couple months later, any money spent on it is simply indulgent entertainment for an hour or less.Seeking out genuine cultural experiences and spending less money really go hand in hand. The vacations and tourism industry is a well oiled machine, made to extract as much money as possible from those seeking low-value entertainment cloaked as cultural education. If you avoid it, not only will you be seeking out higher value experiences, but you will be saving tons of cash.If you are taking a vacation rather than traveling, you might easily be able to justify spending a little more as a reward for hard work, and cramming in as much as you can as you only have limited time off. While this is a fair justification, if this is the way you want to spend your time off, chances are that lifelong learnerAdventures in Learning, Life, and Happiness

2015 is the most opportune time in history to be an apartment dweller or second home owner looking for extra cash. But for the travelers supplying that cash, it’s a different story.Got “room nights” to spare?

Respond at your leisure, or It’s telling that when the largest vacation rental company in the world talks about their “customer”, it means “homeowner”, not “traveler”.Because, if you’re a traveler shopping for a vacation home rental, good luck. Nobody’s looking out for you. And what’s good for the homeowner may not be good for you.The vacation rental space is a minefield.The same homes and apartment show up everywhere.

Yet the largest companies offering vacation rentals today are doing their damndest to cram unique vacation inventory into the commoditized, white-bread hotel room results list format.Vacation planning and booking should be an enjoyable process, where a traveler gets to browse, engage, and dream about the vacation whenever and wherever she wants, viewing big, beautiful photos in a The It’s a confusing time for travelers looking for a special place to stay on one of their Travelers deserve to experience hospitality and respect as they plan and book their mission-critical lodging for these infrequent and important vacations.

I love to travel. In fact, I enjoy it so much that I decided to jump head first into the industry by launching a travel business. After a trip to South Africa I returned home with that wanderlust that cannot be cured. A friend and I first started by selfishly plotting out how we could get travel perks with big dreams to quit our day jobs and see the world. As business women, we eventually moved on to looking for holes in the model and ideating around ways to solve problems.We started to build a list of various ideas, and then we would go search to see if the concept already existed. What we found was shocking. There were hundreds of travel start-ups out there that would be incredibly useful, but the reality is that no one will ever hear about them. Yes, there are the start-up obsessed people that are looking at the latest buzz on Product Hunt, but very few of the services will ever make it to the masses. I read article after article that would talk about new travel business, and most of them were no longer active by the time I clicked on the link a year after the story was published. Try to buy Google AdWords or Facebook ads when you are rivaling the Trip Advisors and Expedias of the world in your bidding, and you will see why it’s tough to break through without major capital. Even when these start-ups get funding, they are usually pouring it back into the experience itself to build something that will keep customers coming back.We didn’t let this stop us from moving forward, but I have felt convicted about the other dreamers like me that took the time to launch ideas that no one may ever know about. It takes a lot of hard work and courage to build a new business, and I want to shine a light on a few companies that have changed my travel planning approach.I was recently booking a flight to Nashville, and I got that pre-purchase anxiety. Is the fare going to go down after I hit submit, or should I book now before costs keep climbing? Hopper is on a mission to eliminate this issue.You may wonder how it’s possible to save on flights when you have access to sites like Hipmunk and Kayak, but the geniuses at We just used Flightfox to book a multi-leg trip (LA  BARCELONA  LONDON  NY  LA). They worked their magic and saved us over $1,000 from the published prices on other sites, which isn’t too shabby considering we spent around $200 for their services on two tickets. The $800 saved will allow us to eat a lot more tapas in Barcelona! Plus, the experience was amazing with fantastic, responsive customer service. We booked on our own and were completely in control of doing the little things that matter, like picking our seats.Do you like to get out of your comfort zone on vacation and try something new? My husband and I went to a Barcelona apartment with an incredibly talented chef, his girlfriend/business partner, three Spaniards, and a Dutch couple. It was one of my favorite nights on the trip because we got to meet people from around the world, taste insanely good food and hear about the best local spots from people who live there. They even said that the EatWith founder had been there and wanted to personally taste their food. We were lost the next day and literally bumped into the hosts on the street, and they escorted us to a nearby churro spot that wasn’t listed in the guidebooks.We tried EatWith a second time on a biking food tour that covered the highlights of Barcelona with true locals who took us to places that would have otherwise been intimidating. Again, we made friends and felt like insiders.There is no shortage of tour options when it comes to visiting a new place. A quick search on Trip Advisor will serve up an overwhelming amount of choices. Whether you want a food tour or something more unique like a Paris photography tour, there is something for everyone. When I use Vayable, I get most excited about the deep passion that the guides have for what they do. They are individual small business owners who want others to experience what they love about where they live, and that definitely comes through in their tours. If available in your area, I highly recommend it for a staycation because you will get to try something entirely new in your own backyard.I wouldn’t be a good co-founder if I didn’t list my own business because I believe it really does solve a need. When we were looking at travel pain points, the biggest one was trip planning. Because of all of the resources available, it could take days and up to 12 hours of time to plan even a simple weekend trip in a place like San Francisco with so many options. We got anxiety about picking the right restaurant in a new place or knowing which tour to take. Because of that, we had worked with travel agents on various occasions. While the experience was typically pretty good, we felt like they would sometimes recommend hotels or services based on how high the referral fee would be for them instead of what best fit our style. Who knew how much we were really paying for their service since the cost was rolled-up.We also both lived in areas where we got frequent visitors. We loved having guests come out because we knew the best spots inside and out and could confidently recommend a fabulous itinerary. We understood what our visitors would enjoy because we had a relationship with them, and we always got rave reviews from guests.We asked why we couldn’t curate passionate travelers from around the world to plan itineraries for a low cost because they know the area and can make solid recommendations. By adding a detailed travel quiz to understand the style of the clients, we could make the itineraries super personalized. And thus, With Proof My Trip, we have curated proofers, who know the areas where our clients are traveling, to put together personalized itineraries within 48 hours, starting at $20 for a three day trip. There is nothing more valuable than time, and we save our clients hours in the planning process and make the most of the time on their trip because they can travel with confidence. The local advice we can give makes all the difference, and we feel so fulfilled when we get frequent feedback that we made someone’s hard earned time away even more amazing. As a bonus, we get to recommend services from other start-ups like the ones above in our itineraries so we can help build other small businesses along the way.Are there other travel start-ups that we should check out? The world needs to know!Personalized travel itineraries starting at $20, delivered to your inbox within 48 hours.

I am a Korean, and I lived in America for 5 years. During stayed in America, I visited Korea only 2 times, and every visit was impressed to me because Korea gets a lot of differences then before, even I am a Korean, I couldn’t recognized where is this place comes out and surprised to newest place I went. Therefore, I want to talk about travel to Korea tips and i can tell you that even there has a lot of differences then before, which is the place you have to go and the place that never changed their endemic theme of the place.-Food culture-Capital of Korea, Seoul, is the most crowded city in the world. because, all the important culture in Korea concentrated in Seoul so even the Seoul space is only 0.61% of whole space in South Korea

Authenticity! Yes! This is what a travel experience is all about.I myself have always been militantly anti-tourist trap, a result of being raised in Colorado Springs, which relies on the military and tourists as an industry. I’ve found my distaste for tourists sprang out of a frustration with them. The want the quick experience. They one they’ve read about or heard about from their friends. Due to time constraints, they don’t want to scratch any deeper than the surface.Like you, I’d rather experience the authentic local fare. If you want manufactured tourism, go to Las Vegas.In 2005, my son moved to San Francisco to attend college. San Francisco is awash in history. It boasts thousands of restaurants, lots of sights to see. Who would eat at a chain restaurant there? There are many acclaimed chi-chi restaurants, but I’ve found the best ones are little holes in the wall with minimal signage and a line out the door. One of the best sandwiches I’ve ever eaten was at a gas station in Napa Valley. A gas station!Why go on a crammed boat to Alcatraz, when there are hundreds of tiny parks to explore in the downtown area? (My first trip to Alcatraz was after he’d been there three years. I couldn’t wait to get away.) The little neighborhoods are far more interesting than Union Square. I’d rather hang out at Ocean Beach than in the sea of humanity at Fisherman’s Wharf.Not so say that the “tourists” shouldn’t have their venue. For me, I’d rather dig deeper.I write. I read. I garden. I cook. I eat. And I love to talk about all of the above. 

It has been exactly a year and a half since I travelled alone. Back then I was on a monthly getaway from Bali, Kuta, Langkawi, Phuket, Krabi, Macau, and Hong Kong, and back to Singapore.I was constantly on the move, leaving the hotel in the morning and get back by around 10–11pm. It was my first time travelling myself then. Naturally, They were scared, My parents, siblings, even myself! :DIt was a rewarding experience. I became more daring to do crazy things (like surfing when I dont even know how to swim). I wish I met more people then but my schedule did not really allow me to.This time, I plan to achieve that. I’ll be on this Island for 5days. Considering to disconnect from the intetnet so I’m posting ahead of schedule.Let’s explore together!

Traveling alone can be very lonely.If given the choice, it is always better to travel with friends. The good news is once you get on the road, it is easy to find traveling companions. So although you may leave your front door and get on the plane alone, you likely will not be alone for long.Let’s not dance around it, loneliness sucks. Lonely is a feeling that hurts.Being alone, in a foreign country and not being able to speak the language can be very isolating and lonely to the point of suffering.The time this was most pronounced for me was when I was on a 2 month tour of China and Thailand. I was a couple of weeks into my trip and I met a great group of people at a hostel. We went to a bar together and hung out and had a good time.But then I went on a 3 day backpacking trip to A couple of days later I saw my old companions in another town and I literally chased them down. I ran through the sea of Chinese people to hang out with the only 2 other foreigners in town, whether they liked it or not.I was desperate not to be alone.If you are in China or another place very different than the U.S. you can be surrounded by people but still be isolated. That is because the most you can do to relate is share a smile. It doesn’t go deeper than that. But if you are human, you need to do more than share a smile. You need someone or a group to share your struggles, your favorite foods, and all the crazy stuff you saw that day.The benefits of traveling with others is huge. You can rely on each other for resources in emergencies and you can bond in an intimate way that may not be possible in your home country. When you are in the middle of China, you suddenly have a lot more in common with the guy from Iowa than if you both were in the States.One of my best memories I have with my dad is when I was 15 and we went to Egypt. One morning, I snuck away with my dad and we walked away from the Western style hotel we were staying in and went walking around the streets of Cairo.We came across a coffee shop and there were some hard hitting Egyptian gangstas chilling in their gangster coffee shop drinking Turkish coffee.My dad ordered us both Turkish coffees. This was a big deal for a kid that was raised Mormon. That was as close to a Clark Griswald and Rusty beer moment as we ever got. This was just one of several amazing memories that I have from traveling with family. I am sure you have several too.Another time, my traveling companion really saved my ass in what could be described as a traveling financial emergency.I flushed my ATM card down the toilet on my first day in Europe at the Amsterdam train station. I was only 21 or 22 at the time.I was talked into believing an awkward fanny pack would prevent me from being pickpocketed. This money belt with an uncomfortable belt strap went under your clothes and made no sense.“Excuse me sir, I am going to pull down my pants now so I can access my money and pay you for these cigarettes”So I am fumbling with my new shit fanny pack after using the restroom and in one motion the horrible happens: I bend over to flush the toilet as my ATM card falls out of my belt strap and directly into the toilet as it flushes to oblivion.My Amsterdam buzz turned to panic in an instant. My only access to cash flushed to the famous Amsterdam canals.I remember asking a train station employee if there was anything they could do to rescue my ATM card. As if they might be able to send a team of spelunkers on a rescue mission into the sewer.Because I was with my sister, I was able to use her ATM card until I got some cash wired to me about a week later. Had I been alone, I do not think things would have turned out so well for me.I did end up getting pickpocketed about three weeks later. Fanny packs will not protect you from being stupid and being at a part of town you shouldn’t be.When I look back through my traveling experiences, they are almost always better when I travel with someone else. But that does not mean that if I can not find someone to go with me to Thailand for 3 weeks that I am going to stay home. As long as I am not going to Iran or North Korea, I can be fairly confident that I will be able to meet people along the way to share my travel adventures with. I just need to go where my people are, introduce myself, and go with the flow. When I am in China and I meet someone from the U.S., we immediately have a lot to talk about.So yes, buy that plane ticket and schedule that trip alone. Just be sure to line up some activities so you can be sure to meet some like minded folks when you get there.

And why I left Silicon ValleyOne year ago, I left San Francisco, sold and gave away everything I owned, and moved into a 40 liter backpack.I traveled to 45 cities in 20 countries, 3 Disneylands, and I also worked 50 hours a week building and launching a And my total costs were less than just the rent in San Francisco.There’s a growing community of “digital nomads” who live a location independent lifestyle. We’re software developers, designers, writers, journalists, engineers, and all sorts of people who share a passion for the work we do and experiencing the world.Three years ago I was preparing to leave my job at Microsoft to move to San Francisco to start a startup. My friend asked me “but why do you need to be in San Francisco when you can work on a computer from anywhere?” His question made a lot of sense. As I thought about it more, I began to question my assumptions about a “normal life” which don’t make sense in our modern world.So off I went, with my crazy new ideas about life in tow.But it didn’t work out so well.After traveling for 6 months, I gave up and still moved to San Francisco. Traveling was fun, but I had a great idea and I needed to really focus and get real work done. What better place to build my startup than Silicon Valley?But I soon found myself becoming too comfortable and slowing down, getting easily bored and distracted, and watching a lot of TV. I sat at my computer for 12 hours a day but didn’t feel like I was productive.On a trip to New York, my friends went to work during the days, so I went out and worked in coffee shops and in Central Park. Suddenly I was hugely productive, getting much more work done in 6 hours than in my normal 12 hour days. The same thing happened a few months later on a trip to London. I was even coming up with better ideas because the new experiences and surroundings were keeping my mind more active.Having figured out the pattern, I left San Francisco a year ago, fully committing to a nomadic lifestyle. And this time it feels like I’ve figured it out. I’m happy, productive, meeting great new people, learning about real global problems to solve, and I successfully launched This is what I’ve learned over the past year.This is my average total monthly spending from one year living in Seattle’s Capitol Hill, one year living in San Francisco’s Upper Haight, one year traveling to 20 countries, and one month at a hotel in Bali. It is much cheaper for me to travel. Since the majority of my costs are from trains and flights, it’s significantly cheaper if I stay in one place.My friends in San Francisco and Seattle often ask me: “How can you afford to travel so much?” I can’t afford not to travel. I’m bootstrapping a company and living in San Francisco was draining my savings.When I first started traveling, I was a great tourist, taking pictures of everything and doing all the activities listed in tour guides. After a couple of exhausting weeks it occurred to me that I’m not on vacation. This is my life now. I slowed down and realized that if I have a month to explore a new city, I don’t need to do it all at once. I can explore the city for a few hours and still get a lot of work done.I was surprised to find out that I’m significantly more productive while traveling. But it makes sense. If I’m only in Rome for a week, why would I waste my time on Facebook? Being constantly surrounded by novelty reduces my boredom and increases my focus, and even I went back to Seattle in June to work next to my co-founder and hash out long-term plans. My development time was surprisingly less productive than while traveling. I was sitting at the computer just as much, but was more easily distracted by internet and TV. And even though I was in 6 different cities in September, I managed to work extremely productive 48 hour weeks. Being more focused while working gives me more time to enjoy the rest of my life, so this is huge for me.Instead of working during the daylight hours and pushing all my free time to the worst part of the day, I prefer to enjoy the days and work at night. I get out of bed faster when I’m excited to go out, and when I don’t have to commute there’s just more time in the day. I like to work 7 days a week with flexible hours so I can take a day off when I please or enjoy an empty movie theater at 2pm.I wasted a lot of time when I worked in an office because of commuting and the massive distraction that is the internet. Now I spread my work throughout the day and take big breaks for exploring. After working for a few hours, I reach a milestone and explore the city until I want to get back to work. Or if I hit a problem I can’t figure out, I My stay at I now have friends all over the world whose life experiences are very different than mine and bring fresh perspectives to my ideas. I’m learning about the real problems that affect the world on a global scale, which will make me into a better entrepreneur in the future.It’s easy to find great people to learn from. There are co-working spaces in It’s never been easier to live and work as a nomad. Traveling is cheaper, more productive, and more inspiring than staying at home. Working in an office is a relic of the past.The digital nomad revolution is just beginning and I’m excited to help it grow.

When you are alone for days or weeks at a time, you eventually become drawn to people. Talking to randos is the norm. I’ll never forget the conversation with the aquarium fisherman, forest ranger, and women at the Thai market. It’s refreshing to compare notes on life with people from vastly different backgrounds.When you meet fellow travelers, you’ll find they are also filled with a similar sense of adventure and curiosity about the world. Five days of friendship on the road is like five months of friendship at home. It’s the experiences that bond you together, not the place. A rule I followed that worked well: Long term travel is different than a luxury vacation. The point is to see the world, not stay in a 5-star hotel. During the trip, I stayed on a strict budget. The goal was to spend no more than Take the cost of your rent or mortgage + food per month and divide it by 30. This is how much it costs per day to live at home. You will find that it’s possible to travel the world for roughly the same amount. Or, if you live in an expensive city like San Francisco, far less.I have lived with a Traveling alone can be painfully lonely. It forces an unhealthy amount of introspection and it’s easy to get stuck inside your head. If you tend to be more introverted and are comfortable doing things on your own, you’ll love solo travel. It’s an extreme luxury to be able to do what you want when you want. If you tend to be more extraverted and prefer having someone around at all times, it will be more difficult.Moving around every few days can be exhausting. I found staying in a single place for a minimum of 2 weeks was the right pace. It’s enough time to see the sights, meet some locals, understand the culture, and also have a few days to plan your next move. I would rather go slow and fully explore a place than go on a whirlwind tour.If you travel to escape your life or problems, it won’t work. They follow you. In fact, you become more aware of struggles and shortcomings when you’re alone. The paradox of travel is that after a while, you long to be in a familiar place with a routine. When you’re in a familiar place with a routine, you long to travel. It’s a balance and you need both lifestyles to appreciate them.We are all incredibly similar. Everyone just wants love, validation and a sense of peace about their future. I met many folks who were in the midst of making major life decisions like where to live or work. The reality is nobody has a clue what they are doing. Some people are just better at pretending to know what they are doing than others. We’re all human and You can make life work anywhere. Over time, you adjust to the local culture and people. It’s possible to book a flight anywhere in the world, find a job, meet friends and just live there. It’s not as difficult as I previously thought. A friend of mine has a theory: the easiest way to make the transition to a new place is to have $5,000 or 5 friends there.I was surprised how many people spoke English (apparently 1.8 billion people worldwide). Places where English was less prevalent, I made an effort to learn a handful of words and phrases in the local language. Even though it’s passable, I do desire to learn another language fluently. You can only take the conversation so far when all you can say is: “It’s possible to communicate a lot without saying a word. For instance, I left my phone at a restaurant in Chile. I pointed at the table where I was sitting, put my hand to my ear like a phone, then shrugged — 2 minutes later, my phone had been retrieved.I learned to trust that tiny voice in my head a bit more. When you are alone in a foreign country and your phone is dead, you are forced to trust your intuition. Is this neighborhood safe to walk around? Is this person someone I should interact with? Am I heading the right direction? Intuition is like a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it becomes. It’s feels like a sixth sense when you’re able to read between the lines of a situation.I feel incredibly fortunate for the opportunity to see some of the world. This planet is big and beautiful. You realize there is no way to see everything in a single lifetime. I will definitely do another trip like this — hopefully with my future wife. *crossing fingers*Designer in San Francisco.

She’s the one with the messy unkempt hair colored by the sun. Her skin is now far from fair like it once was. Not even sun kissed. It’s burnt with multiple tan lines, wounds and bites here and there. But for every flaw on her skin, she has an interesting story to tell.Don’t date a girl who travels. She is hard to please. The usual dinner-movie date at the mall will suck the life out of her. Her soul craves for new experiences and adventures. She will be unimpressed with your new car and your expensive watch. She would rather climb a rock or jump out of an airplane than hear you brag about it.Don’t date a girl who travels because she will bug you to book a flight every time there’s an airline seat sale. She wont party at Republiq. And she will never pay over $100 for Avicii because she knows that one weekend of clubbing is equivalent to one week somewhere far more exciting.Chances are, she can’t hold a steady job. Or she’s probably daydreaming about quitting. She doesn’t want to keep working her ass off for someone else’s dream. She has her own and is working towards it. She is a freelancer. She makes money from designing, writing, photography or something that requires creativity and imagination. Don’t waste her time complaining about your boring job.Don’t date a girl who travels. She might have wasted her college degree and switched careers entirely. She is now a dive instructor or a yoga teacher. She’s not sure when the next paycheck is coming. But she doesn’t work like a robot all day, she goes out and takes what life has to offer and challenges you to do the same.Don’t date a girl who travels for she has chosen a life of uncertainty. She doesn’t have a plan or a permanent address. She goes with the flow and follows her heart. She dances to the beat of her own drum. She doesn’t wear a watch. Her days are ruled by the sun and the moon. When the waves are calling, life stops and she will be oblivious to everything else for a moment. But she has learned that the most important thing in life isn’t surfing.Don’t date a girl who travels as she tends to speak her mind. She will never try to impress your parents or friends. She knows respect, but isn’t afraid to hold a debate about global issues or social responsibility.She will never need you. She knows how to pitch a tent and screw her own fins without your help. She cooks well and doesn’t need you to pay for her meals. She is too independent and wont care whether you travel with her or not. She will forget to check in with you when she arrives at her destination. She’s busy living in the present. She talks to strangers. She will meet many interesting, like-minded people from around the world who share her passion and dreams. She will be bored with you.So never date a girl who travels unless you can keep up with her. And if you unintentionally fall in love with one, don’t you dare keep her. Let her go.This article has resonated with so many travelers around the world and has been translated into over 30 different languages.Check out my blog www.lovethesearch.com for the translated versions.

Now that I’m 31, I understand why people say But it’s not that you won’t get the chance. It’s that it seems so much To clarify, I’m not talking about the kind of travel that neatly fills those allotted twelve days of annual vacation. No, that kind of travel is frenzied, restricting the majority of life to an unnatural cycle of constant want of more.I’m talking about the kind of rugged, unplanned long-term travel where you give up owning most things, leave behind a stable home, learn to live simply on a budget, and really see the world for months on end. The kind of travel that was possible after graduation, when you strapped on your backpack and jumped into the unknown world, flowing carefree wherever the wind blew.It’s this kind of travel that, with age, starts to look more and more like a piece of expensive art to be admired but never bought.I’m plenty familiar with the broken record of reasons why not to go on such an adventure. The list of limitations, real or imagined, is endless. To leave it all behind—to give up your life—a thick ugly shadow of fear clings to the mere idea of such drastic change. You’ve become increasingly stuck in a well-worn pattern. You have bills to pay, health insurance, a car, family, babies, retirement savings, taxes, pet chickens (well, maybe you don’t, but I do). The real world doesn’t want you to leave the safety of cubicle land. It’s warm and fuzzy there. And it sure is boring.But you see, this is Really start to think about that.Understand that this is It won’t ever get easier, it will only start to fade away.Once you feel this, I mean You should do this because travel will make you feel more alive. It will inspire you again, kindling that lost flicker of creativity until new ideas start to boil and bubble from deep within. It will allow you to create more, to feel freedom again, and to start your life anew.Travel will challenge your well-worn assumptions and accumulated habits. It will shake up your boring old patterns, make you feel every raindrop and taste every bite of mango. It will surprise and delight you, causing you to laugh deeply at funny German accents and flop down on dirty airport chairs, exhausted and frustrated that you’ve been awake for 24-hours and still don’t know where you’ll rest your head. Traveling this way might make you uncomfortable, but it will also show you more clearly what you have and who you are.Along the way, you’ll collect lots more dots, and then it will be up to you to connect them,as Above all, travel will make you appreciate the familiarity of home. It will restore your sense of childlike wonder for what was already there. And when you return, you will remember what it is to truly be alive again.Storyteller, design thinker for social good.

Sponsorships are like unicorns or leprechauns, talked about often but they don’t actually exist. There is only dollars and cents, the bottom line and ROI (that means return on investment).I make a living creating videos for companies. Most of the videos involve me doing really fun stuff. It’s a great job and perfectly understandable that I get emails, mostly from young people, asking misguidedly how they can get companies to pay for their adventures. The emails usually read something like;‘We have been planning this trip for 3 years… dreams… inspire…etc.— how do we get a company like Nike to sponsor us?’My response is usually harsh. Offended at the suggestion that a career that’s taken more than a decade to create could be summed up for others to emulate with a single email.That’s not fair. It’s a wonderful dream of a career and I can’t blame others for wanting to pursue something similar. I can say with confidence that there is no defined path to such a career. Maybe explaining the path I took could be helpful, this is that.I have always made a living to make movies, never the other way around. When I first started I washed dishes in a seafood restaurant to support my filmmaking. Only in the last few years have I been able to get hired by companies to make the films I want to make and have the result be mutually beneficial. This was never my specific intention. Just an organic evolution.After my As the YouTube movies picked up traction, some got Nike hired me for such a campaign in late 2011. The contract was for three videos. Nike might just be the coolest company to work for but even so there were typical considerations. They had a product to sell. As such the first Make It Count was a movie I’d wanted to make my whole life; pure recklessness, in every capacity, told in 4 minutes. It’s easy to make sense of a movie like that now in retrospect. At the time we had no idea what we were doing. I had confidence that if we just went for it, experienced something great, that we could embody that experience in a short movie and that movie would benefit the client. This wishy-washy bullshit is something that I am sure agencies hear and roll their eyes at all the time, as they should. No one would green light such vagueness, no one should. We didn’t have a green light we just did it without sharing the specifics with Nike. It was a big risk. A bigger risk when In the end we created one of Nike’s most watched internet videos and a springboard for what is now my career.It took more than 10 years to create an opportunity then required taking a huge risk to take advantage of that opportunity. There is more to it than just Make It Count. There are years of work before that video was possible and there have been countless other videos made since Make it Count but it did serve as a major pivot point in showing videos like this could work.Do the work first. Create the following and the audience first. Prove your value first. Demonstrate your understanding of an industry first. Do all that then and only then maybe will a company have the confidence in you to provide the freedom and creative latitude for you to do what you want that will ultimately benefit them and their bottom line. It took me 14 years to understand this.I have made 86 videos for my YouTube channel in the last couple of years. 8 of them were for clients, 78 of them were for me. My focus is and always has been on making the work I care about. It is an honor to have found a way to get paid to create work like this, something I value greatly. There are no shortcuts. No one is going to pay for your vacation, no one cares, no one gives a shit and they never will. If you want something, anything, do the work and earn it.follow Casey Neistat on this is casey from YouTube

You better get good at taking selfies.Earlier this year, I traveled alone across Europe. In some cities I knew a friend from college, in others perhaps a friend of a friend, but for all intents and purposes I wandered around by myself with no plan for about a month. Even for someone a close friend recently referred to as “the most extroverted person I know,” it was one of the best months of my life.Both at home and abroad, though, the idea of extended, solo travel seems oddly foreign. Common reactions to my travel plans included:“Wow! Good for you to be able to do that!”“Don’t you get “You mean, you’re going do all these things…by yourself?”Yes. Traveling by myself was the most thought-provoking, battery-resetting thing I’ve ever done. Here’s how to do it right, and why it’s so much more impactful than traveling with other people (even people you like).It is Be it school, work, family, or something else, we all have obligations — things we need to do to avoid bad things from happening. It doesn’t mean we don’t enjoy those things, and it doesn’t mean we’re “trapped” in some unfulfilling nightmare. It just means our lives are intertwined with other people, and our actions have consequences. Obviously, getting away from these obligations is good for the soul, and pretty much everyone recognizes time off is a basic human necessity from time to time.But as much as we may enjoy spending time with friends and family, traveling with other people adds a layer of complication and compromise to everything. Not only do you have obvious stressors like competing preferences, travel styles, etc., but at every turn there’s a hidden pressure to coordinate your plans — or at least tell people where you are. Without even realizing it, you often make subtle but very real sacrifices to keep a similar schedule and stay together.It’s not that this is the wrong way to travel — some of my fondest memories are road trips with friends and vacations with family — you’re just not doing It means you sleep when you’re tired and eat when you’re hungry. It means you don’t care about drinking too much because you don’t have any plans it will destroy tomorrow. It means you spend It means you can be And it means you don’t have to shave.Disclaimer: The “right dose” of WTF varies from person to person and how stressed out you’ve been. I ran my own startup for the past 4 years, so I needed a long time to fully reset.Somewhat related to WTF time is the role of serendipity. When you travel by yourself, random, amazing opportunities present themselves much more often. While this is partially due to the fact that you have no one to coordinate with (i.e., you’re in WTF mode), it’s also a function of basic probability.When I was in London, I wandered into an African restaurant called Souk. The waitress put down a basket of bread on my table, so, thinking it was mine, I started eating it. Turns out, it was for the couple next to me — a fact I realized when we made awkward eye contact with a piece of their bread in my mouth. Day 2 in Europe and I was already “that American asshole.”About 8 hours later, I was in a VIP suite watching alt-J with my newly adopted European parents, Andy and Anita.What happened? Funny enough, stealing their bread was a great conversation starter. After trading life stories for the duration of the meal, they asked if I was busy that night. It turns out they had an extra ticket to go see alt-J, whose London show I was dying to go to but ended up missing the sale period. I exclaimed, “You’re joking.” To which they responded, “Feel free to take it, even if you can’t come. It’s a VIP suite though — hope that’s okay.”This kind of thing doesn’tIt’s not that you’re luckier when you travel by yourself. It’s simply that the probability of a lucky event intersecting with your path in a way that you can actually take advantage of it is much higher. Moreover, because you have no “fallback” for human contact, you start and continue more conversation with strangers (the harbingers of serendipity).Whether you’re at home or abroad, talk to the people around you — you never know where a conversation might lead.At least in American culture, shared silence is typically frowned upon as When you travel with others, you obviously tend to talk with them quite a bit. This isn’t a bad thing — communication strengthens bonds, and everyone brings a unique perspective to the conversation. However, in the pressure to externalize your thoughts, you don’t really get a chance to reflect internally. But if there’s any time when you should be thinking, it’s when you’re experiencing new places, cultures, and history for the first time.Traveling alone for an extended period means you spend a lot of time inside your own head. As you float around cities and countries, your mind also wanders — thinking, reflecting, analyzing, observing, and drawing comparisons about whatever happens to be interesting at that moment. It’s not that we don’t spend time thinking when we’re with other people, it’s that our thinking is guided by the conversation. Alone, bombarded with new stimuli at every turn, your mind can truly appreciate the juxtaposition of people, places, and things.One day, while walking by French parents dropping off young children at school, I noticed that they watch their children run away from their arms with the same combination of pride and sadness in their eyes as mine probably did — shouting, “Behave for your teachers!” and “Have a good day!” (in French, obviously). The next, I was reading the tombstones of Egyptian pharaohs in the Louvre, boasting of conquests of people I’ve never heard of all in an attempt to convince their gods they’re worthy of entering the afterlife.Another day, I saw a guy and a girl on a blind first date hit it off, hang around for 3 rounds, and walk out of a South London pub arm in arm. Later that week, I found myself wandering around the steps of the Colosseum, where thousands of people watched men kill each other for sport.On Tuesday, I wandered through the caves of Europe’s most active volcano (Mount Etna). By Friday, I was listening to a Slovenian jazz group perform in Vienna.Yet another day, I was hugging jumping up and down with strangers at a rugby match, with old Irish guys shouting, “The week prior, I felt my stomach sink instantly upon walking into an old building in Poland.These two furnaces incinerated the bodies of hundreds of thousands of people, where an incomprehensible number of lineages were A few days later, I sat for about 30 minutes staring at two walls stacked on top of each other. On the bottom was the remaining foundation of the SS building, where these atrocities were planned in the 1930s. At street level was a segment of the Berlin Wall, one of the 20th century’s most iconic examples of segregation, erected just 30 years later.Spending that much time reflecting on the human condition isn’t for the faint of heart, but it’s good for you. You’re going to think about death. You’re going to think about your own insignificance. You’re going to think about how silly violence is. You’re going to think about how Most importantly, you’re going to think deeply about whether or not you’re living your life meaningfully. That’s just where the mind tends to go when left to its own devices.Convinced you should give solo wandering a try? Awesome. Here are some tips for how to take advantage of it:1) Stay at hostels with bars. They usually have the cheapest drinks in the city, and it’s way easier to meet people at hostels that have a bar where people hang out at night. You’ll meet really interesting people from all over the world. Especially Brazilians. Brazilians, you people are everywhere.Incidents happen, certainly, but just read the reviews on 2) 3) If you don’t have indefinite time, stay ~3 nights per city. This might just be my style, but two full days is enough to get a feel and do most of the touristy things you want to do.4) Don’t be stupid. Some places in the world are definitely not safe to travel alone, especially for women.5) Have a general idea of where you want to go, but don’t plan out more than a few days in advance. That way, you avoid being stuck somewhere, but you leave yourself plenty of optionality in case something sounds cool along the way.6) While you’re eating meals, try to read the news of that country. If you speak the language at all, try to read a print copy (I did this with Le Monde in Paris). If you don’t, load up a few articles from an English language version of the news on your phone when you’re somewhere that has wi-fi. It gives you a better perspective on what people are thinking about where you are.7) If possible, schedule stops where you have a friend or two you can hang with — even if you haven’t seen them in decades. Unless they actively dislike you, people are usually thrilled to meet up with international travelers.8) Splurge on food in Italy. Jesus Christ.Need more recommendations?

After a few days of relaxing and eating at our favourite spots in Hong Kong, we met up with a friend who was just starting his travels in Xian.Xian is one of the oldest cities in China, and was once their capitol. The centre of the city is surrounded by a tall wall, which is then surrounded by a moat.The first thing we set out to do was visit the Bell Tower and the Drum Tower, built over 600 years ago. I wasn’t very read up on the history before hand so I wasn’t sure what I was visiting, but what I found was my first glimpse at how rich this city’s history is. The bell was used to signify the start of each day, and the drum was used to mark the end of it. Even the areas that have been restored completely here have been around for ages, with tourists visiting from all corners of the earth.The following day we took a bus for the sweet price of 7 yuan each, to see the Terracotta Warriors. The price is worth noting because if we listened to the drivers outside our hotel and the bus stop, we would have ended up spending upwards of 300 yuan for a drive there and back..There’s such an overwhelming feeling looking at the statues. Each one, with it’s own hair style and selection of facial features, looks like it could very well have been based on a real person with his own personality. It felt like they were in memory of hundreds of individual people. The first building houses rows upon rows of the completed statues, but more interestingly were the statues housed in the back, and in the other buildings. Half finished and held together in various ways, these ones were puzzles in the process of being put back together.Another popular tourist activity? Riding along the wall surrounding the city. Rental prices were cheap, the day was beautiful, and the ride took about an hour and a half at a relaxing pace. It was an interesting way to see the city, and when we were done making the loop there was a beer and burger joint where we could relax.After having such an active trip so far, we felt we might as well keep it up.. Half an hour on a high speed train and another half on a gondola later we found ourselves on HuaShan, home of ‘The World’s Most Dangerous Trail’. Picture, if you will, stairs. As many as you can imagine. Steep ones, of varying angles and widths. Now double it. That’s what we ended up climbing this day. It was surprisingly difficult at times, but so extremely worth it. People from all over the world have hiked here, and tens of thousands have left prayer ribbons and ‘love locks’ attached to any surface that one would be capable of attaching things to. We hiked to different peaks, and I saw the enterance of the plank walk, pictured below.We spent the whole day there, and my knees were shaking by the time we made it to the gondola to get back down. We all walked a bit funny for the rest of the trip, and (not so quietly) whined when approached by stairs going in either direction. I’m only just recovering.Before I left, a friend mentioned I had to try biang biang mian, in her very minimal English. A Shaanxi famous noodle dish with one 3 meter long, belt wide noodle, topped with veggies, tofu and meat. The dish is not only famous for the shape of the noodle, but also for the name itself. The character for biang contains 58 separate strokes.After our noodles we headed to our last tourist stop on our Xian trip: the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda, a Buddhist pagoda built in 652, and repair several times since.We didn’t go inside (stairs) but the views outside were stunning. The statues, architecture and trees were more than enough to keep us occupied before hobbling back to the subway to go home, cotton candy in hand.Eastern Canadian living in Western China.

For our second anniversary, Here’s our itinerary and photos.We flew out of Lafayette, LA at 9am and connected in Houston, TX, and Los Angeles, California, before arriving in Maui at 7pm. By the time we picked up our luggage, loaded up our rental car, and drove to our condo in Lahaina, it was almost 10pm.It didn’t take us long to shower and go to bed. Sweet sleep.We considered making the early morning trek to Haleakala to watch the sunrise on our first day, but we were way too exhausted to do that. We’ll come back to that in a few days.Instead, we relaxed throughout the day, hit up the beach, and enjoyed a relaxing night at Warren  Annabelle’s. If you ever get the opportunity to go to Maui, that show is an absolute must. It was our second time, and we hope to go again and again.We got up early and headed to the little town of Paia for the morning. We took it easy and wandered around, shopped, and ended our time there with an excellent lunch at Flatbread Pizza Co.After lunch, we went about 20 minutes passed Paia (on the Road to Hana) to a small opening in a bamboo forest. Luckily, we found our unmarked destination and headed off on a hike through the bamboo forest, over and through a river, by a couple gorgeous waterfalls, into a small natural pool, and back again.Tired and muddy, it was back to the condo to get cleaned up before a relaxing dinner and date night.We pre-planned this day as an off-Maui adventure. We woke up early AM and flew to Oahu on IslandAir. We picked up our rental car and drove directly to Diamond Head. It was a very hot day (by Hawaiian standards), but we climbed all the way to the top for some amazing views.Next, we made our way to the USS Arizona to see the memorial built in honor of those who lost their lives in the attacks on Pearl Harbor. It was my first time visiting it as an adult. I am very glad we took the time to see it.We had a little time to kill before our flight back to Maui, so we drove around the Waikiki area for a little while. On the way back to the airport, we stopped at Big Kahuna for an absolutely incredible dinner. The garlic cheese bread was amazing!Next was airport, flight back, condo, sleep.After an exhausting day in Oahu, we decided to take it easy on Sunday. We went to the beach, we shopped, we explored, we read, and we relaxed. If you go to Hawaii, make sure you take the time for a day or two like this.Explore time. We woke up early and loaded into the convertible and took off down Honoapiliani Hwy, the opposite direction of Lahaina and Kapalua. What a drive! (Side note: We did the Road to Hana on our previous trip.)One lane (but two way), windy roads on the beach and in the mountains. Amazing views, hairpin turns into oncoming traffic…and some truly amazing banana bread at Julie’s.At the end of the drive, we stopped in Wailuku and ate some very tasy Thai food at Saengs. It was mid afternoon, so we had the entire restaurant to ourselves. We ate almost every bite.We headed back to Kahana for a bit, then ate in Lahaina.Explore time part 2! This time, we went the other direction to Kihei. I’d never realized how touristy this area was. For some, this might be perfect. But we quickly realized that we’d chosen the correct spot for us — Kahana.We stayed through the morning and long enough to eat an incredible BBQ meal at Fat Daddy’s. It was delicious!We headed back to Kahana  Lahaina for a relaxing evening together and fun Luau.Ahh, early mornings. Our alarm went off at 2am. Yep, 2am. We were in our car at 2:30am heading to the high point of Haleakala Volcanic Crater (it’s not really a crater, but that’s another story). The point of this trip is to experience the drive and the most beautiful sunrise you’ll ever see.We arrived at the top a little after 4am, found us a great spot amongst the crowd, and waited for a little over an hour in freezing temperatures. By sunrise, I couldn’t feel my hands or feet. But it was worth it! They call it a spiritual place, and it’s hard to disagree. Seeing God’s amazing morning painting can’t be described or even captured. It’s beauty in a way that you can only experience in person. I’m getting chills just writing about it.We made the long drive (partially above the clouds, We woke up, did lunch, and spent the rest of the day at our condo’s beach until dinner. Ohana Tacos to the rescue. Another win for food.On our last full day, we just relaxed and took it all in. Nothing was scheduled. We ate at Aloha Mixed Plate and Lahaina Pizza Company. We bought souvenirs and gifts. We went to the beach. We read.And we packed for our trip home.Our flight was scheduled to leave at 4pm on Friday, so we had the morning to do a few extra things. We drove in to Kahului early, did a little shopping, and stopped at Wow Wow Lemonade for some truly amazing drinks. We grabbed a quick lunch at a local bbq place before returning our car and checking in at the airport.It took till about noon on Saturday, but we finally made it to Lafayette by way of Chicago and Houston. Straight home, straight to bed.It was an incredible trip and I struggled to convince myself to return to reality. By all measures, it was an anniversary to remember!You can follow Web Designer.

This week marks my 6 months since Back in Hong Kong, I used to travel regularly, around Nothing big, usually only to nearby South East Asia countries, like Singapore, Philippines or Thailand. Travelling used to be a relief for me to refresh myself, restart and recharge in order to So today I am hoping to reflect and see what happened after I moved, why I haven’t been travelling since I have moved to London, and why do we travel in general.To get to the bottom of this, I have to look at what motivated me to travel back then.Getting away has always been the major reason I travel — whenever I felt like I am stuck in life or at work, I knew that I had to get on a holiday to pick myself back up again.For a brief period, to forget about all the bad things that were happening, leave everything behind and just relax for a few days. This might sound ultra weird but I guess this only shows how much of an introvert I am. Being in Hong Kong there are so many things to attend to, some many people to entertain and it just drains all of my energy.Sometimes I might just want to stay in cafes in another countries when I am travelling and that would already make a perfect vacation.I could work on my personal projects, watch and observe people, and appreciate the little things in life that I had no time for when I am living my busy life in Hong Kong.As you might have noticed I like to reflect a lot (what I am doing right now by writing this post!).Whenever I travel I really like meeting like-minded people. But this is So this is more like a bonus, but you’d be surprised to know how many nice and inspiring people I have met throughout my years of travelling and Even though my salary has adjusted, living in London is no fun for the wallet. The expenses are crazy and not to mention the rents. This is partly restricting my travels, trying to not spend too much on top of my regular expenses.Over the years I have come to realise, like most of us, I am not a huge fan of changes. I like staying in my comfort zone, unless there’s a huge motivation for me to change. Back in Hong Kong it was the stressful and busy life that kept pushing me to travel.Ever since I have moved to London, I have less things to worry about, and life is Even though I have been to London a few times already, on top of these 6 months living in London, the atmosphere and surroundings of this new London life are still very refreshing and exciting to me. Mostly because of how big and cultural London is.This is what I had come to conclusion with: I have been travelling for the wrong reason.I was travelling to get away, and less of travelling to gain new experience and meet new people.So when the circumstances changes and I am now in a more comfortable place, I no longer desire to travel, to get away as much. One thing I know for sure is that travelling is a But for me even tho I have less desire to take a trip to travel because of some financial and environmental circumstances, All these being said, even tho I might have less desire to travel, I am still very much curious to what Europe has to offer. It might take me more effort to plan and commit to a trip, but I will definitely still plan some travels. To not limit myself in that little city I call home. To see all these people around the world doing great things you have never dreamt of doing. And best of all, And in between these travel trips, I will still be travelling — Like what you’re reading? If so, join your fellow travellers and 

[Note: Even though this kind of article is precisely the kind (the only kind) that should be made into a ‘listicle,’ I resisted the temptation because, à la A few days ago, I read a I have had the privilege to travel quite a bit, and I’m living abroad and traveling right now, but certainly not because it’s “the only way to spiritual enlightenment or meaning.” Hell, I think you’re more likely to attain spiritual enlightenment sitting in silence in front of a brick wall for years than galavanting about South America. Nor is traveling necessarily a great means to build character — depending on how you do it, it may just reinforce privilege. However, I do think it’s especially good for cultivating Travel isn’t the only way to experience these things, but Everyone’s dream experience while traveling is to stumble across an incredibly willing and interesting local who wants to show you all the best spots in town that aren’t in the guidebook. Next in the fantasy, maybe they invite you to their place to meet their friends and you spend an evening getting input from a dozen more locals while enjoying homemade cuisine and the local boozy drink. Even more thrilling than finding this while traveling isAfter years of hosting and meeting travelers through Couchsurfing.com, I learned that seeing your own place through the eyes of a foreigner can be very revealing — they’ll point out things you never noticed (yes, I suppose we do have far too many brands of toothpaste to choose from), ask questions that totally confound you (why are there so many homeless people in San Francisco?), and delight in things you had no idea were so delightful (squirrels). Being with a group of foreigners for several hours can teach you a lot about other places, too, and make you start to feel like the outsider, in a good way. Don’t worry — you’re still an insider with the info on the cool spots in town, so they won’t want to let you go.You’ve seen that mural a hundred times, but have you ever really Last year I was strolling through a familiar neighborhood of San Francisco — a city I’d lived in for nearly seven years — on an especially beautiful day, and a fragrant blooming wisteria slowed me down just enough that a mural caught my eye. It was huge — covering a wall a block long — and very intricate.As I looked closer, I realized it was also a kind of poem. I ended up spending half an hour taking pictures, reading and examining the work, and wondering what kind of drugs the artist was on and where I could get some.“Sunflower smiles at the bamboo,” it says, as a hummingbird approaches a giant flower and a woman spins around a bamboo pole below.The trees have feet covered in mushrooms and there’s a rabbit smoking a pipe inside the moon, which is also a jellyfish. A small Noah’s Ark with a light-up castle inside rocks in a calm sea.The final frame reads, “Don’t worry, we are just a way water reaches the sea,” a line attributed to French surrealist poet Antonin Artaud. Oh, the humanity! As it turns out, the I stroll by “street art” with nonchalance every day, so now it takes something special to make me notice or dig for the story underneath it. Instead of waiting for that perfectly placed wisteria, just set out with that intention — be your own blooming wisteria, and take a minute to wonder. You might learn something new about your town (or just wind up happily lost in a psychedelic poem-painting).We repeatedly go to the stores we know and like the best, to the same hairdresser, to the same bars and cafes. Decide that for a week, you won’t do any of your errands or social outings at places you’ve been before. Go across town, get confused about where you can find things and ask people, walk into a bar alone that you’ve never been to, get copies of your keys made at a new hardware store (for those travelers you plan to host) — anything! The only rule here is no chain stores, which is cheating because they’re the same everywhere. This one isn’t complicated and it doesn’t have to be radical, just get a little out of the comfort zone of all the places you know so well. Try to walk or bike so you can actually see what’s there.This one is the hardest in that it requires you to be vulnerable. Implicit in this recommendation is that you have to have already met someone from outside your social circle — that part’s easy. Maybe when you were lost looking for a cafe across town and you asked the lady on the corner, you ended up having a chat and inviting her to come to the cafe with you. Perhaps she said yes and you had a nice conversation over iced lattes, but she lives all the way over there across town, is 20 years your senior, and has strange political views. Invite her to your party!I know this is easier said than done. Fear tells us, “She’ll probably say no. My friends will judge me for bringing someone weird. She won’t like it and will leave early.” Do it anyway. The idea here is not to integrate this person into your friend group forever. Connections you form with people that are not based on common interests or background force you to connect to them from somewhere else.An important reminder for this one (and one I’ve learned the hard way): try to not be the debater, defender or devil’s advocate right away; just listen and ask questions. Making this a habitual response to new people is one of the most powerful ways I’ve changed my stubborn habit of steering away from people that disagree with me or that I perceive as different. Succeeding at this one can really send you into that compassion and openness territory. When you see someone in the light of their truth, you see that it shines no less brightly than the light of your own.Last week a friend from college reached out and mentioned that he was moving to my hometown of Huntington Beach, CA, and asked if I had any recommendations to share. It could be argued that Huntington Beach is where culture goes to die — its notoriety as being part of Orange County is actually It was an interesting experience, this outpouring of love for my hometown, and it made me reflect on what connects a person to a place. Little bits of me are wrapped up in that town and I realized that I wanted him to be able to connect to it, too. People connected to their place treat it differently — they treat it like their own, they care for it. In a country full of transplants, it’s important to pass along these stories. If you now live somewhere that you didn’t grow up, strike up conversations with strangers or friends who did. If you did grow up there, share your stories with new arrivals. This is probably one recommendation that is actually You would probably get a guide to learn about the flora and fauna if you visited the Amazon. Imagine your own place as the exotic locale. If there’s water, it’s likely that you can explore by boat or kayak. If there are mountains, hills, forests, trails, plains, deserts — discover them. Travelers that are not especially outdoorsy suddenly become quite intrepid when traveling because The Outdoors seems somehow different. Maybe it It doesn’t have to be a big dangerous adventure, either. If you live in a city, there are likely to be urban walking or biking tours, and they’re often free. I once thought these guided walks were touristy and cheesy, until I did one in New Orleans at the request of my English then-boyfriend, who had never been to the U.S. before. The volunteer who led it was in her mid-fifties and had lived in New Orleans her whole life. The walk was seemingly not rehearsed — it was like taking a stroll with a local in love with her hometown. It included all kinds of great personal stories, local legends, culinary recommendations, random meanderings and a bit of history. There are walks in many towns and cities for people that are into architecture, murals, ghosts, social activism, community gardens, and myriad facets of history.—I believe these travel alternatives deepen the way you connect to your place and change how you approach new people and ideas. They may not lead you to spiritual enlightenment, but maybe they will lead you down a road less traveled, and that, as we know, makes all the difference.

In July I was on a trip through Iceland with That’s a question many people have been asking me before, during and after this journey.Everybody knows that one thing people tell you as soon as they’re back, ‘you either love it or you hate it’. Watching the daily news and talking too much to those haters, almost makes everyone believe India truly is filthy, crowded, corrupt, extremely poor, chaotic, full of gender inequality and illiterate.But the more I read and talked about it, the more I started to see the other side which appeared to be the exact opposite, wealthy, educated, cultured, peaceful, happy and even well organized. One of the travel tales I have been reading over and over again is Paul Theroux’s ‘The Great Railway Bazaar’. A classic travelogue recounting Theroux’s four-month journey by train, partly covering the Indian hippie trail. After living and travelling through Asia for years, I tried to make it to India twice but both of the times life got in the way and I failed. Third time’s the charm you would say. In 2013 I went for the first time.Sensory overload, color clashes, sound cacophony. More than any other country I have been to, India felt timeless and so connected to its past. The sari’s people still wear, the ancient cuisine they still adore, the immense amount of dialects that still exist and the gods people pray to at roadside shrines or in impressive temples. And while wandering through the countryside with my camera in one hand and my western point-of-view in the other, I realized I had never been in any place where predictions of disastrous collapse and global supremacy must be treated with such equal seriousness. To find out how the Indians themselves are feeling about this contrast, I’ve been asking many of them from all walks of life various questions while being on the road. Their answers were nothing short of spectacular.In India there is 3 basic rules. Rule nr 1. There is always something magic and unexpected around every single corner. Rule nr. 2. Anything can happen. Rule nr 3. There is nowhere like it. It’s cliché but so true. Not a single day ends the way you planned it in the morning.Besides that, I guess there is no country which encapsulates diversity so perfectly. The simplicity and quietness of rural life is striking and unpretentious compared to the intense city buzz in metropolitan cities like Delhi and Bombay. And apart from heavy contrasts, there is 3 more things you’ll find everywhere; endless smiles, carefree spirits and cows.After touching down in Calcutta, one of the most polluted cities in the world, we made our way into Varanasi, the spiritual capital of India and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Located right at the Ganges we went head first into the heart of India.I’ll never forget my first encounter with one of the holy Brahmans (priests) at the river banks, welcoming us with the wise words: ‘Welcome to a place where the human past is still alive my son”. A damn pretty conversation was the result. Allright. Time to embrace our inner beastie boy and start cruising down the small alleys of the Holy city.Although everything in this city centralizes around one central theme, death, it’s by far the most colorful, chaotic and unapologetically indiscreet places on earth. Being the beating heart of the Hindu universe, the Indians believe that if you’re cremated here, you skip the cycle of reincarnation and go straight to the favored next place. Because of that demand they decided that cremations go on 24 hours a day and integrate the most intimate rituals of life and death into daily life causing all corresponding sounds, sights and smells of cremation and grief to be right in your face.However, it truly is a magical place. Praying and crying people in the ghats, playing children in any courtyard, floating bodies in the river and daily life around the corner. And again eternal smiles everywhere. It sounds cheesy but arriving in Varanasi means connecting with the soul of India, one of the most ancient countries in the human civilization. The way the Indians embrace that one thing Western people fear the most, death, is unique, intense and will live long in everyone’s memory once you saw it. And that one medicine man upon arrival at the banks of the river was right: “The closer you are to death, the more you are alive”.Luckily India proved itself to be so much more than finding your inner beliefs amongst weird hippies and Israeli freedom hunters in highly polluted cities with the nearest beach a 1000km away. Plus apart from downing a stiff shot of whisky before and after each meal, to avoid the infamous Delhi belly, we were in desperate need of party time. So in search of papaya shakes, golden sunsets, psychedelic beach parties, garlic roasted mega lobsters and lots of Goa trance, we made our way down South.However, as a photographer, it’s hard to resist all those amazing stories and corresponding faces coming your way. Besides that, realizing that there is heaps of drinking time back home too, we quickly left Goa and slowly made our way through the provinces of Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra. And the weeks that followed those beautiful stories kept on coming. I’ll tell you a few.“Dharavi is a criticized part of the world my friend. Severe poverty, poor hygiene and living conditions, child labor, corruption, cholera, typhoid, malaria, blackmailing. All has been said. But I’m a proud man calling this place my home town. Over 60 years ago we started off as a small village community in the Maharashtran marshlands and grew — without any form of government support — to become a billion-dollar business miracle providing food and recycled plastic to Mumbai and exporting crafts and goods to the entire world. We are the lungs of this city, the lungs of India, and will always be my son.””Tourism had a significant effect on Gokarna my friend. You know there is a distinction between intellectual and physical enjoyment? The former was once the greatest kind of enjoyment over here, but it slowly disappeared when tourist came and got taken over by physical enjoyment. The situation worsened over the years because if you can’t find intellectual challenges you have to find physical ones. Prostitution, drugs, alcohol, just to have your own dreams. However, I still love the town for what it once was and will always do.”Besides one of the best massages I ever experienced and many interesting insights into Ayurvedic principles and its traditional medicines what especially drew my attention was his vision on the power of the daily food we consume on our health and wellbeing.. Considering his remarkable fit appearance and his clear state of mind, I certainly believe much of his words could have an impact on many of us.. “Our lives are not in the lap of the gods my son but in the lap of our cooks..”These guys are constantly exposed to high levels of chromium and sodium in the toxic runoff that is used for the coloring of leather. This causes painful skin rashes and respiratory problems and even has reduced life expectancy to less than 50. Despite the dizzying heat, stench and health hazards, they are glad to be earning $1.50 a day.“It’s hard labor. But what else can I do? So better accept it. Complaining makes it even worse”Meet Stuart Shaw, 54 years old, decided to leave Canada behind and take his wife and 3 kids on a one-way journey to India in 1999. Ever since, Stuart devoted his life to helping others while sacrificing his own. He started going down the tracks of the Howrah train station in Calcutta, looking for young abandoned children addicted to the most horrifying kinds of drugs, many of them missing limbs due to being overran by trains. Meanwhile his wife started her fight against human trafficking by picking up innocent young girls from the brothels around the notorious Kali Ghat area in town and attempting to provide them with a reason to live. All of their effort came together in 2009 when they established The Calcutta Mercy Centre. A school, situated in a former leather tannery in the Chinese quarter of Tangra, providing education to hundreds of kids that left their life in the Calcutta slums behind. After witnessing all of this I asked him to share one of his life lessons with us.“In a country where 400 million people are living below the poverty line and in a city where 2 million are homeless, it’s hard to decide which kids to take, it’s a choice who lives and who dies.. I thought I understood life but now that I’ve spend my time here, I only know less..”Writing this, my mind jumps back to India all the time. It’s dusty, intense, hot, challenging and very very strange. But on the other hand it’s so friendly, polite, warm and welcoming. Besides that it truly is impressive how, in contrast to many other parts of the world, religions go hand in hand over here. Eventually that one professor we spoke to in a small countryside university was right: “ It’s a place whose children grew up in a global superpower but yet still know what it means to belong to an ancient civilization.”Want to get more travel inspiration?Check out: With entrepreneurial regards,Founder  MD Succès fou Holding BV | 

Most of the travel industry is fixated on mobile — with good reason — but the biggest single booking method is still desktop. Mobile — smartphones and tablets, apps and the mobile web — barely Mobile bookings are growing rapidly — they will nearly double by 2016 as travelers become increasingly comfortable booking by touch, and travel companies deliver a better mobile experience. But when it comes to travel planning, mobile plays a much bigger role — more than a third of travelers use their smartphone for destination selection and shopping, and when these mobile travel planners do migrate to desktop for the final purchase (and most do), how they book is changing significantly.So Phocuswright partnered with Millward Brown Digital (MBD — known formerly as Compete), to assess the state of online travel traffic amid an increasingly mobile landscape. We examined and organized traffic patterns and conversion across hundreds of online travel’s biggest sites in the U.S. on a monthly basis for 2013 and 2014. Two big trends jumped out:For travel’s biggest online categories, So what’s going on?

The myth of El Dorado, which drew global attention in the era of colonization, was essentially built on the premise that the golden city is out there for the taking. And while many thought they had the correct treasure maps, no one could seem to find it. El Dorado remains, to this day, a metaphor for idealistic goals deemed unachievable.Sustainable travel is not an El Dorado. Indeed, while the landscape is littered with variants on its meaning, and even more treasure maps for creating a sustainable experience, it is in fact a goal that can be achieved by anyone planning a travel experience. Moreover, it is a goal that Not only is sustainable travel good for the world, it is good for the bottom line. It can serve as a key to gaining new clients, nurturing existing relationships, and doing well by doing good. Consider the following a guaranteed, tried and tested treasure map for reaching Tourism’s El Dorado.To grasp at the value of sustainable travel, we must first gain an understanding of just how large and potentially impactful the industry is. In short, it is ubiquitous. Over a billion trips were recorded in 2012, with a trajectory of reaching 1.8 billion by 2030. It encompasses 9.5% of global GDP, and employs one out of every eleven individuals globallyYet, after scratching the surface one finds a darker portrait of the industry. Only 5% of a traveler’s money spent abroad remains with the community visited, and that number drops among poorer destinations. Flights alone account for 2% of global carbon emissions, and will increase due to higher traffic and greater efficiency in other industries. The most popular forms of tourism, namely big-ship cruising and all-included resorts, are also usually the most destructive to the environment and the neighboring communities.But here’s the catch. While the status quo may seem dispiriting, demand for a better industry is clearly there. A recent As for those pesky millennials: given that by 2017 they will emerge as the largest and highest spending demographic in the world ($200 Billion a year)The much-reported success of new businesses that have build impact into their model, such as Warby Parker and Etsy, has successfully reverberated across the business field. No company worth its mettle goes on without proudly displaying its CSR report to all who care to listen, and the transition from a reactive ‘give back’ approach to a proactive ‘shared-value’ business model is taking firm hold across industries. From Nike and Unilever to Patagonia and Ben  Jerry’s, positive impact now has a seat on the board of directors.As the world moves towards a redefinition of business, it is our turn to help push Travel to meet its potential for positive impact on a global scale.The goal of this exercise to do away with the term ‘sustainable travel’. All 1.8 billion trips to be taken in 2030 should be optimized for impact, by default. Traveling in a way that is better for the world cannot be left to the agency of the client. After all, positive impact is already expected by that, and they are reaching out to you, the travel professional, to meet their demand. The onus for pushing sustainability from niche to mainstream thus rests on the supply side of the travel industry.Unfortunately, as with all things worth striving for, becoming an agent of change in travel will not be a simple linear process. There isn’t a single, definitive index for approved travel products yet, and with the apparent ubiquity of green-washing (when claims of impact aren’t carried out correctly, if at all) doing good isn’t always so easy.And so, bearing the above in mind, the following is a universally applicable checklist of questions and actions to be used when planning travel. In drafting this document, I relied mostly on the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) as the authoritative source on this issue. I highly recommend combing through sets of criteria they provide.As a rule of thumb, it is always best to first seek out any third-party certifications achieved by the business or organization in question — particularly certifications that include an external audit and that are recognized by the GSTC. This approach is the most effective shortcut for optimizing travel for impact. Unfortunately, many of the most impactful businesses in the travel world, particularly in the developing world, do not have the ability to go through certification even if they deserve accreditation.

Use your best senses in making decisions informed by the information compiled using the checklists. If you read this far, you clearly care about this issue, and I trust you’ll do the best you can.Some travelers will undoubtedly remain adamant about preferring cruise-liners or all-inclusive resorts. When this is the case, the following checklist can be applied:1. Suggesting alternatives that are more positively impactful.a. Mega-yachts instead of major cruise-liners.b. Eco-resorts or resorts with third-party certification recognized by the GSTC instead of standard resorts.2. Offer alternative, impact-focused excursions at the destination visited.3. Offset the entire experience with a recognized carbon-offset program.4. Create an ‘impact report-card’ providing a summary of the positive impact they generated based on the decisions made.Travel is as old as humanity itself, and as ubiquitous as our incessant, primal need for exploration. The industry is already the world’s largest, and will only grow as populations emerge from poverty and technology lowers the affordability bar. It is in our DNA. It is our right. Indeed, the United Nations has declared the freedom to travel as a human right, cited in article thirteen of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.While not mentioned in any of the of UN sustainable Development Goals, which set the agenda for global development in the next 15 years, the travel industry will play a significant role in their success. This can only be achieved through a renewed awareness of the definitive role that each travel professional can play.Awareness and action, through use of tools such as the checklists offered in this piece, will transform Travel into a global force for good — and the world into a friendlier, healthier, and safer place for us all.

Entire chunks of life lost to a swirl of non-memories. Meaningless soul sucking corporate blank stares and coffee breaks. Mashing at a keyboard forgetting what I was typing, casually checking facebook then back to the typing then to reddit then back to typing then facebook again. A constant cycle of passive passionless ‘work’ capped with a frigid car ride home and a half frozen microwave dinner. Thus goes the modern human experience.We all know what it’s like to hate our life. Don’t you dare deny it. For me I was never happy with a corporate lifestyle. I demanded something more. Burdened by one endless existential crises after another at the tender age of 23, I knew there really weren’t any other options for me. I had to find something more.I searched for a way to work remotely. It didn’t matter how, I just had to get out of there. At first I was going to sites like wwoof where you can work on organic farms across the world. It seemed nice but limiting and tedious searching for work. I needed something more consistent and dependable. That’s when I found a forum for mothers with newborn babies. It was a forum exclusively dedicated to discussing ways they work from home to be with their kids. I mined it’s pages for an answer and found it when I read the word’s Virtual Assistant.I had never heard the word before. After a few more google searches I had found my calling. It was a non-technical job that almost anyone could get into with some basic knowledge on communication and organization. Something I could do from my computer without any specialized degree’s or training. It was the perfect storm, the precise recipe for freedom I’d been seraching for.I landed a job with multiple clients. The money began coming in and I finally realized what was happening. I had a steady income that I could attain anywhere with a wifi connection. I was free. Soon after, my Girlfriend and I decided to sell everything we own and leave. We didn’t have a plan of any kind. We bought a ticket to our favorite city in Spain and just let it happen as it wants to. We were ready and never second guessed our decision.It was the first time in my life that I felt like I had control. It took me ~4 google searches and a hastily made resume to get complete control of my life. I could go anywhere, literally do anything I want. So I did. We went to every coastal city we could find in the South of Spain. Spending evenings sipping Sangria from our AirBnB patio and cooking breakfast with our Couchsurfing hosts in the mornings. We roamed the castles of Portugal and danced in the clubs of Barcelona. We rode boats with the locals of Turkey and drove motorcycles through the mountains of Thailand. We backpacked through South America and even relaxed on the beaches of Cancun.Working remotely gives you the best of everything. You wake up and work when you feel ready. You sit down in your room with an ocean view and drink coffee with your girlfriend as you type away at something that means something to you with a a girn so big it hurts.From becoming a Virtual Assistant to Money means nothing to me now. My girlfriend and I are living for under $30 per day. We have traveled to 11 countries and 5 contients for $30 damn dollars per day. This is less than you’re paying for your apartment in Baltimore. This is less than you pay for your damn student loans. You can do this. If you want this at all send me a message and I’ll help anyway I can. This is the future of travel and in my opinion the future of work. Jobs will be measured not by their salary but their flexibility. Trust me, once you get a taste you’ll never go back.

Having stepped on five continents within the past year, visited eleven countries, and met people from all over the world, it’s hard to tell stories without sounding like a fully pretentious asshole. But besides the incredible experiences I’ve had driving down Great Ocean Road in Australia or drinking hot wine while walking through Christmas markets in Paris, I’ve found that the most important things I’ve learned are incredibly mundane.

Travel is one of the most valuable privileges a person can enjoy. Traveling light is an acquired skill made possible through endless practice and I find myself bragging about the latest iteration of my gear to anyone who will listen. Allow me to do so here.As the CEO of an When I travel, I have some requirements for my gear and I am able to adhere to these requirements based on certain assumptions about the region to which I’m traveling. My basic requirements for traveling light are:The major assumptions I make in order to hit these requirements:You’ll notice at once that the assumptions I make are both extremely privileged and also slightly contradictory to my requirements, specifically the one about not buying stuff along the way. The idea is to not need to buy anything by packing enough but giving myself the room to do so if absolutely necesary.Over the years, the one tool that most helps me travel light is my packing list. I keep it stored in an iCloud note and update it frequently. I always check it during the packing phase and I aggressively review it part-way through my trip to see if I brought anything along that I didn’t end up using. If I find something I didn’t use, I delete it from my packing list so that I don’t repeat mistakes.(Note on pictures: I noticed they are a little blurry. My room is darker than I realized but I’m not going to unpack and retake the pictures. ;)Here is my current packing list:That’s it. A few things that I used to pack that I don’t anymore:The extra stuff used to matter a lot more to me in Tokyo, where people still dress relatively formally in a business setting. I’ve decided to basically ignore this convention recently because a) Japanese internet companies are much more casual than they were a couple of years ago and b) I figured I could play the Silicon Valley dude card. So far, no negative impact on business.Gym shorts I no longer bring because I work out in my hotel room, using my jump rope and variations on the 7 minute workout. Same deal with extra shoes.I used to bring 2–3 pair of jeans but I found that just by washing the pair that I wore every 2–3 days at night, I could save a lot of room and weight. I usually try to stay in hotels with built-in washing machines but if those aren’t available, I just use the hotel laundry service.My favorite topic when it comes to travel: gear. I learned the most about packing light when I traveled around the world for 12 months a few years ago. I was able to carry everything I needed in a single backpack, through multiple seasons, changing out clothes as the weather changed.Surprisingly, however, when it came to business travel, I was still quite an amateur until I really started thinking about what I actually needed on my trips.Just a few years ago, I was still checking in a big, ugly, black suitcase at the airport and lugging it around with me as I traveled to the various hotels on my itinerary. Once I realized how silly this was, during a trip to Europe, I decided to switch entirely over to a carry-on suitcase and eliminate anything I didn’t need. I picked up a Lufthansa-branded (it was all they had) Rimowa carry-on suitcase at the Frankfurt airport and, until today, used it over the last 2 and 1/2 years on all my trips. I love it.I had no plans to change my gear until a The thing that attracted me to the Minaal bag was the promise of being able to put everything into my pack without straining the locks on my carry-on (a constant challenge) and the ability to put my laptop inside with a smaller laptop case (see below) that I could use once I had gotten into territory. Those features, combined with the overall styling and light weight, made it worth a try.After packing everything today, I can say that I am truly impressed. All of the above gear fit into the Minaal beautifully and it is quite light and easy to carry.All this means there is only one thing I need to take with me to the airport: no extra computer bags, there is nothing to wheel around.I’ve picked up a few tips along the way that have really help me pack quickly, without forgetting anything (knock on wood).Over the years, several products and brands have made my life better through their higher quality, durability, appearance and ease of care:I learned about this amazing soap when I first went backpacking for an extended period of time. It’s completely natural and organic, smells great and, due to its concentration, lasts forever.You can use it as body soap, facial soap, shampoo, shaving gel and laundry detergent. It does dry your skin out a little so make sure you have some sort of hyrdating lotion to use after you’re done showering. This one bottle alone allows me to leave behind 4–5 other bottles I would normally need to take, unless I wanted to use the poisonous chemicals they provide you at hotels.Despite my being an American, I’ve come to appreciate having an umbrella during a storm. I hate carrying around bulky umbrellas though. The best, micro-umbrellas I’ve found are sold in (wait for it)…Japan.The umbrella in the picture above weighs probably 200 grams and is resting on top of my 11 MacBook Air, for size comparison. I hardly know it’s there, even when I put it in my rear pocket.Earlier in this post, I mentioned two clothing brands: Zara and HM. Their clothers aren’t particularly durable but they look good, are generally lightweight and are inexpensive. They are also global companies with retail stores in most major cities, so it’s easy to restock with clothes that I know and like, whenever necessary.On the other end of the spectrum, So far, I own the following items from TAD:The Ranger Hoodie is a great casual hoodie that works well in both urban and rural territories. It keeps me warm in temperatures down to freezing temperatures, and gets a little warm at temperatures about 18 degrees celsius. I usually wear this on the plane because it’s one item that is too bulky to fit into my bag.This is another bulky item and it is VERY warm, so I usually only wear it during winter months. When I travel internationally in the winter, I bring this instead of the Ranger Hoodie.It weighs like 5lbs of heavy Merino wool. You won’t get cold and it looks good.I’ve never worn this on an international trip because it’s more like a hardshell and a little harder to move around in. I’ve worn it over a short-sleeved t-shirt while skiing and it was perfect. It’s good for prolonged exposure to the elements in cold environments.As you can see, it’s styled in the same way as their Ranger Hoodie.This is my new “dress shirt.” When I’m speaking publicly, I usually like to at least wear a button-down shirt to lend a bit of respectability. I bought this recently and will be wearing it for the first time when I speak later this month.It is styled well and has some special features built into the design, such as being a shirt that doesn’t print while CCW. If that sort of thing doesn’t matter to you, another nice feature is that it doesn’t seem to wrinkle much at all. It’s lightweight and packs well.Depending on the season, I’ll additionally bring a light jacket. It’s September now, so I can often be found wearing a simple t-shirt with a light jacket that I can throw on when it gets cold in the evening (a habit I picked up after living in San Francisco).I’ve tried lots of different styles and have arrived at a design that like the best, and which has the following features:My current jacket is a Zara jacket that bought this spring. I’ve been quite happy with it so far and it’s coming with me on my next trip.I usually just work out in my hotel room in my underwear. Try not to picture it.I used to bring gym shoes, shorts, etc. and go to a gym but it took too much time and weighed me down. Now, the only gear I bring is a simple jump rope and do a bunch of calisthenics in my room. The 7 minute workout, with multiple repetitions does the job pretty well.Once I’m done, I just throw everything in the washing machine and shower.I tend to ask this of myself every time I travel: would this work if I was going to be traveling for a long time (e.g., more than 3–4 months)?You never know for sure, but based on my extended travel experience in the past, for 12 months, I have a pretty good idea of what I really need / don’t need while traveling. I’m pretty confident that this setup would work for me and, as I mentioned above, I can always buy what I need along the way.Your mileage may vary.CEO  Founder, Ginzametrics enterprise marketing intelligence platform.

I didn’t travel anywhere by myself until I was twenty-two. And then I spent a year as an international hobo. Now I travel alone all the time. For work, and for pleasure. There is too much I want to do and see to wait for the perfect travel buddy.I like solo travel now, but it can still be hard — one morning in Anyway, here are some things I do to make it easier to go it alone. These tips are definitely not meant to double as advice for budget travel! I don’t do that at the best of times, and certainly not when I’m traveling alone — it’s stressful enough.I’m an ambivert, which means that I need to keep my social time and solo time in balance. Experimentation has let me know that three to four days of not speaking to anyone is fine, but I probably couldn’t cope with more than that. So if I go for two weeks, I break it up into social sections (places where I know people) and solo sections. If it’s a short trip, or I’m starting with solo time, then I’ll “people myself out” before my departure by going out every night. That way, when I arrive at my destination I’m due some alone time, and I’m happy to embrace it.I have very little sense of direction, but that’s OK, because I have a ridiculous number of cellphones, being a mobile developer. The first thing I do when I arrive at my destination is acquire a SIM card (or maybe a portable Wi-Fi device). Buying a card can seem overpriced, but I’m happy to pay the $40 or so for a few days — I know that it allows me to be more adventurous with restaurants (through recommendations and Foursquare), and lets me take fewer cabs (mobile mapping means I don’t get too lost and have to cab it home because I’m too exhausted to figure out another way). It also makes me feel safer — if I’m in a cab alone, I can track the route the driver’s taking and make sure it’s not out of my way.Other solo travellers swear by hostels as a way to meet people, but I’m not sold on the idea. I’ve never stayed in one when traveling alone. My experience is that hostels are uncomfortable and feel unsafe (this may be skewed by the fact that the last one I stayed in was a former jail). I want to stay where I can get directions and recommendations from the concierge, relax quietly if I’m feeling overwhelmed, and order room service if I’m sick or if my flight’s delayed or if I just feel too exhausted to go out and find food. Exploring can be stressful, but where you sleep shouldn’t be.I love roaming about cities by myself: I usually plug in some music, set a park as a destination in Google Maps, and go. As a bonus, daylight and exercise are the best things for jetlag! Once I’m roamed around enough to appreciate the place, I’m much more relaxed and feel ready to explore more.Things I love to do alone: reading, walking, visiting museums and art galleries, and hitting the spa. Things that I’m OK doing alone: eating lunch with a book, shopping. Things I find stressful to do alone: eating dinner and going to the movies or the theatre. So the more things I pick from the first category, the happier I’ll be and the less I’ll miss not having company.I went to a show alone Sometimes I practice doing things I don’t really like to do alone while at home — like going to a restaurant I’ve been meaning to try by myself, or going for brunch to my favorite place alone. Maybe someday I’ll go to the movies alone.I have status with the Star Alliance, and I try to stick to flying with them, especially when I’m alone. Having access to a lounge when a flight is delayed and you’re exhausted is really handy. Some lounges allow you to leave a bag at their reception rather than having to cart all your belongings with you to the bathroom, for instance. The bigger airports will usually have showers, and it’s nice to be able to get clean before the red-eye after a day spent wondering about. The chairs in lounges are more comfortable, there are snacks, and I don’t feel as if I have to continually watch my stuff as much— I can relax with a book or even take a nap.During the week more people travel for work, or they’re just going about their regular day. On weekends, people are more social, and restaurants are less keen to accommodate a table for one. There are also more couples about, which might not be what you want to see if you’re traveling alone because you just had a breakup!The biggest benefit of traveling alone is never having to wait for anyone. That could give you the opportunity to see more stuff, or it could just give you space in your day to chill out. I know my energy levels, and given that I spend most of my time on vacation walking or standing, leaving my hotel at 9 am and not returning until bedtime would be too much. So if I get an early start, I’ll aim to return for a bit in the afternoon and chill before I go out in the evening. Or I’ll return early and go swimming or something before bed. Or I’ll linger over lunch and drink more tea and read. Putting pressure on myself to be on the go for over twelve hours a day never makes me happy.Something I really want to do in Hong Kong is have afternoon tea at the Peninsula Hotel there. But I didn’t do that on my I don’t view my solo trips as trips-of-a-lifetime, or think about the destinations as places I’ll never see again. That takes the pressure off and leaves me free to do what I want to do on that particular trip, not follow some list of “must do” attractions.If I see something a friend would appreciate, I email it to them. If I see something really cool, I tweet it. People usually reply or comment, and I get a little social interaction. I’ve also included my friends in my trip, in real time.The shared memories of a trip are usually the best thing you bring home when you go with someone — “Do you remember when we took that I know that many people swear by taking only carry-on luggage, but given that I use my frequent-flyer status (see above), my bags come off the plane quickly, and I almost never have to wait long for my luggage. Checking a bag means that I don’t have to deal with a max-size carry-on by myself, both in the airport and when I’m on the plane. My goal is to have enough clothing to avoid having to hand-wash anything when I’m away.When you’re traveling on your own, hardly anyone cares what you look like, and you’re probably never going to see the people you meet again anyway. So comfortable, easily packable clothes should be a priority.I lived out of a small holdall for all of last July. I did this by packing about five variations on the same outfit — leggings and a long T-shirt — and wearing them every day. Not my best ensemble, and after that month most of the leggings and shirts got relegated to the back of my closet, never to be worn again.Having a break from looking pretty and “making an effort” can be liberating. When I travel, I’m after an adventure, not to fall in love.When I visited I love going along with what other people want to do: I see different things than those I would have chosen myself, and it helps reassure me that I don’t live in a filter-bubble.But when I go places by myself, I often do things that may seem odd, but so what — they make me happy! While visiting Copenhagen, for instance, I spent about four hours in the most beautiful graveyard I have ever seen. Solo travel can be more stressful, but it’s worth it. Managing and reducing the things that you find stressful, and embracing whatever it is that you love doing by yourself are the keys to enjoying it and getting the most out of it.A slightly different version of this essay previously appeared on Subscribe to Medium’s travel collection:Adventurer.

By I skipped the in-flight meal on Air Koryo—the only North Korean airline, which consists mostly of a small fleet of planes bought at discount from Russia in the late 1980s, decorated with yellow wallpaper and silk doilies on the headrests. When the flight attendant produced from her cart a gray, mushy soup in a Styrofoam bowl, I smiled and said No, Pyongyang International Airport is basically a one-room building. (“International” is a somewhat misleading term, since the number of destinations has dwindled to China, Russia, and a few Southeast Asian countries; most European cities have forbidden Air Koryo from landing at their airports, due to concerns about aircraft maintenance.) Upon arrival, visitors wait in a poorly lit hall beneath large portraits of Kim Jong-il and his father Kim Il-sung, the prime architect and “eternal president” of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Under the watchful gazes of “Dear Leader” and “Great Leader,” uniformed soldiers inspect each passenger’s every possession, disarming them of “objectionable items” such as cell phones, iPads, radios, telephoto lenses, GPS transmitters, and any other modern communication device you might’ve been foolish enough to bring into the “hermit kingdom.”As a soldier unpacked and gingerly repacked a pair of my jeans, the silence thick between us, I tried to think of something lighthearted and totally anodyne to say. “Levi’s,” I observed. And the soldier—who was wearing an enormous felt military cap, the same olive color his grandpa probably wore in the 1950s while fighting my grandpa—looked up and grinned. Almost instantly, the smile faded. He stamped my visa and I moved on without pressing my luck. Under national decree, citizens of the DPRK are forbidden to speak with foreigners—and unauthorized conversations can result in imprisonment.My tour group was waiting for me outside the airport. I was two days late to North Korea, owing to a lost-passport fiasco. We hit the road as soon as I cleared customs, headed for the town of Wonsan, on North Korea’s eastern coast. Everybody had already eaten dinner, but they saved me a meal. As the bus departed Pyongyang, Mr. Lee—our government-issued tour guide and minder—sat down beside me and produced two plastic boxes, their contents obscured by old condensation.“We’ll eat together,” said Mr. Lee. I popped open the box to find a small piece of fish on a bed of rice and kale.Just as I was about to dig in, I felt a tap on my shoulder. My friend Harry’s face was conspiratorially wedged between the window and my seat.“The fish—not good,” he whispered quickly, raising his eyebrows. He glanced at Mr. Lee, who was already eating, then retreated to his own seat. I turned to face my dinner, rattled. Getting sick from eating spoiled fish in North Korea, where health care is on par with plane technology and drugs like Tylenol and penicillin are rarities, would likely be a nightmare. But I knew I should eat it; refusing your first meal in a foreign country seemed only slightly less offensive than burning its flag. In North Korea, citizens of the United States are collectively referred to as I knew I ought to eat the fish. But in the end, digestive anxiety trumped global understanding. I turned to Mr. Lee.“Looks delicious, but I ate on the plane.”I closed the lid and held up the box sheepishly, as a peace offering.Mr. Lee stared back blankly, a grain of rice stuck to his chin. I could feel the lie—and my hunger—resonate against the walls of my stomach. After a moment, he accepted my dinner. And with that, my first North Korean meal was finished.I felt another tap on the shoulder.“Good call,” Harry whispered. “Want a Kit Kat?”Each year, a limited number of tourists are allowed to visit North Korea, the most isolated nation on earth. All tours are highly scripted and follow a similar pattern. Tourists are only allowed to visit a limited number of preapproved sites. Most days you are confined to the bus; government minders accompany tour groups everywhere and dictate everything, corralling you through tightly circumscribed itineraries. Our tour was coordinated by a travel agency in Beijing. Leading up to the trip, the agency sent our group, composed of fifteen students, informational PDFs that read like inverted Miranda rights. “Foreign visitors to North Korea may be arrested, detained, or expelled for activities that would not be considered criminal in any other country.” Prohibitions included straying from the group, practicing religion, and interaction with the local population. There are designated tourist hotels, where North Koreans are not permitted to stay—in Wonsan, the Songdowon Hotel is on a foggy, abandoned pier jutting out into the Sea of Japan. In Pyongyang, the Yanggakdo Hotel is marooned on an island in the middle of a river, with a checkpoint restricting North Korean citizens from entering. The hotel mostly serves Chinese tourists and businesspeople. When we were there, only a few of the forty-seven floors were in operation; if you pressed the other buttons on the elevator, the doors would open to pitch-black hallways, some with wires hanging from the ceiling, others with no carpet.There is no Internet in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The government owns and controls Ever since the Soviet Union caved in, the West has quietly and expectantly awaited North Korea’s implosion. But the Kim Dynasty and the Workers’ Party—a cabal of elites in Pyongyang who’ve micromanaged North Korea for nearly seven decades—have hung on, buoyed by a disproportionately oversized military and a Big Brother ethos of state surveillance and constant propaganda. The streets of Pyongyang are studded with towering bronze statues of Kim the Elder and Kim the Younger (the estimated countrywide statue total is 34,000). Along rural highways, every other hillside is plastered with giant red signs proclaiming the glory and eternal victory of Juche, North Korea’s national ideology of self-reliance and state patronage—a mash-up of Marx, Lenin, and Mao dreamt up by Kim Il-sung and articulated in his dozen or so books on the subject. A few days in North Korea teach you the basics of Juche: it is a philosophy of extreme nationalism capitalizing on resentment over historical injustices, especially toward the original Japanese colonization and the destruction wrought by the Korean War, for which North Korea ascribes blame exclusively to the U.S.After Kim Jong-il’s death in December 2011, his youthful son Kim Jong-un succeeded him, and the world wondered if the new leader might open North Korea up to a new era of liberalization. Throughout 2012, Kim began to legalize previously forbidden behavior. Suddenly, North Korean women were allowed to wear pants and platform heels; bans were lifted on Western foods like pizza and hamburgers; in midsummer, Mickey Mouse and Winnie-the-Pooh—classic icons of the DPRK’s cultural enemy—appeared as characters during a nationally televised event attended by Kim. Google executive Eric Schmidt visited in 2012, prompting the ruling party to relax restrictions on cell phones. Dennis Rodman made a meaningless “basketball diplomacy” visit months later. The overall effect was a burnished image for Kim and North Korea. The Supreme Leader was seen at Mangyongdae Amusement Park outside Pyongyang, pointing at roller coasters, ordering the managers to upgrade the video arcades, and eating french fries with schoolchildren.But by early 2013, the U.S. and its allies were saddling North Korea with some of the toughest economic sanctions in history, and Kim Jong-un was threatening to revoke the armistice that ended the Korean War. In January, North Korea startled the world with its third nuclear test launch. By March, it was conducting mock drone tests and threatening to attack U.S. military bases in Japan and the Pacific Islands if provoked. In other words, the sea change in Pyongyang’s politics never came, and Kim Jong-un has assumed his inherited mantle as pariah leader and nuclear rocket rattler.Visiting the country might be the best way to confirm these doubts about the prospect for change. North Koreans are perhaps the most repressed people on earth. Dissent is forbidden, and an enormous clandestine web of intelligence agents and neighborhood informers watches over society, ensuring that threats to the system are swiftly expunged. An estimated 200,000 North Koreans have been sent to Soviet-style gulags (or “reeducation camps”) in the mountainous north. The world knows little about these labor camps, save for a few harrowing memoirs from those who escaped and lived to tell the tale—but by all accounts, political prisoners are forced to work until they die. Or, as one of our guides put it, “People who do bad things are sent to work very hard, until people forget them.”Everything in North Korea is tangled in misinformation. The government churns out constant fictions that citizens, lacking any reference point, are obliged to accept as reality. Visitors are left feeling slightly dizzy, wondering where the illusion ends. Every experience we had in North Korea felt somehow theatrical—as if the country put everything on hold during our visit and staged a simulated version of reality. We visited an adult-education classroom full of computers, with students who were apparently working on Word documents but never once touched the keyboards. I walked behind three students as they lazily moved their mouses over the screens—one was generating a document of complex math equations, another worked with architectural diagrams, and the third with dense paragraphs that looked like a technical manual. All of the Word docs were in English. Each student was wearing earbud headphones that didn’t appear to be connected to anything.What the guides told us always felt vaguely deceptive, even when deception was totally unnecessary. We visited Kim Il-sung University, the best academic institution in the country, supposedly attended by 18,000 of the brightest North Korean minds. The stunning campus is full of Roman columns and marble staircases. When we showed up, the place was deserted. All of the classrooms were empty. Why? “It’s farming season,” a guide told me. “So the students are at the farms with their families.” But a few minutes later, I cross-checked this explanation with a different guide. “It’s Monday,” he said, “so the students are doing construction work off campus.” Five minutes later, a third guide made an announcement to our entire group. “Unfortunately,” he said, “the students are currently swimming at their swimming pool.” He said that the university had an Olympic-sized pool, located far from where we were touring, and that all the students had gone there after classes, “because after 1 p.m., they are free.”It was impossible to know if the guides were aware of how dubious we were. If they were, they surely didn’t show it. All three guides were perfectly composed all week. After leaving Kim Il-sung University, we got back on the bus and the guide made another announcement. “I’m sorry we could not see the swimming pool and the students,” he said. “But if we did everything this time, you would never come back to Korea!”Breakfast in Wonsan consisted of small whitish omelets with specks of green onion. On the side were three slices of white bread and a tiny fish, fried whole, that looked like miniature tilapia. For post-breakfast dessert, the waitresses brought plates of browning apple slices. As a tourist in North Korea you don’t eat in restaurants, per se. You eat in large empty banquet halls, located in large empty hotels. North Korea is a country full of negative space, of wide boulevards with no cars—silent, still, and eerie. At mealtime, our bus would pull up to a deserted building and we’d be herded through dark hallways to vacant dining rooms. (Not a day passed that I didn’t hear the phrase “This place reminds me of In Hamhung—a large industrial city a few hours north along the coast—we had salty glass noodles (Dinner was a schnitzel-like breaded beef—some had seconds, but most people skipped it. It was accompanied by perfectly cut cubes of bread that looked like large beige sponges; they were a bit sticky but tasted exactly like Wonder Bread. On the side was more kimchi, and a flavorless sauce filled with bits of tough, dried fish. Again, most people skipped it. Throughout the week, some people in our group ate more than others—I tended toward that end of the spectrum; the guys in general seemed to be less picky. A few of the women in the group never took more than a nibble of anything, joking that our weeklong trip was their “North Korean Diet Cleanse.” But each of us, to a certain extent, survived off Harry’s trove of Western snacks, which he carried around in a duffel bag.Everywhere we ate, we left quite a bit of food unconsumed in our wake. It’s certainly ungracious to snub the food in a foreign country—but in North Korea, avoiding a meal sometimes seemed like the only prudent thing to do. After several members of our group fell sick, our concerns about the freshness and provenance of the food increased. In keeping with the highly scripted nature of the week, meals were largely prepared well before our arrival; if we arrived behind schedule, the food would often be served cold. Our guides never explained anything about the food or how it was prepared. The dishes were mostly plain versions of Korean classics, like But a quick glance at any statistic about health and nutrition in the country will tell you that each of our individual meals would have easily dwarfed the average daily caloric intake of an ordinary North Korean. Protein of any kind is rare in the countryside, and fruit is a real delicacy; even our browning apple slices were a relative luxury. By local standards, the amount of food we were served was obscene. Which only makes our rejection of it all the more ugly.Having lots of food in places that lack food is always awkward. I’ve eaten lobster in Nairobi, across town from the Kibera slum. I’ve had a filet mignon sandwich after touring the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. I’ve lived, worked, and eaten well in South Sudan, one of the poorest countries on earth. I was based in the remote and rural village of Marial Bai, overseeing the construction of a high school and educational center; as a foreigner and a guest in the community, I was served three square meals a day while most families struggled for one.In the moment it feels strange, like playing the fiddle while Rome is burning. The feeling is vaguely horrible and acutely hypocritical. But you eat anyway—because the food is there, and you’re hungry. You share your food as much as possible, of course, and make other small gestures (kindness, humility, friendship, humor) to allay the moral dilemma. But you eat. And if the food is good, you savor. There’s some cognitive dissonance at play: you understand that people all around you may be starving, but you enjoy your meal.In North Korea we committed something of a double hypocrisy: we knew people around us were starving, and that we were being served feasts, but we didn’t enjoy them.North Korea is a famine state. Outside of the military and elite circles in Pyongyang, the country suffers from chronic food shortages and rampant malnutrition. Longstanding malnourishment has led to generations with stunted growth—the average North Korean is three to five inches shorter than the average South Korean. In rural areas, adults and kids alike look diminished, visibly smaller than the residents of Pyongyang. North Koreans are among the few populations on earth for whom life expectancy has been shrinking—a small club that includes Iraqis and the male population in Russia, which for years has been dying younger due to alcoholism.The inefficiencies of a socialism based on centrally planned and imposed collectivist agriculture, combined with the fact that only one-fifth of land is arable in North Korea, creates perpetual food insecurity. The feeble economy has never successfully adopted large-scale farming or modern agriculture technologies; irrigation systems depend on electricity (which the DPRK can’t produce enough of), and fertilizers must be made in factories (which depend on electricity). We drove from coast to coast, passing vast farmlands, but never saw a tractor. Farmers use crude hoes and ox-drawn plows to till the soil; women crouch in rice paddies, seeding and weeding by hand. Annual estimates by the World Food Programme indicate that even at maximum levels, domestic food production in North Korea still falls short of the population’s basic needs, sometimes by as much as one or two million tons of grain in a bad year.How, then, does North Korea feed its own people?The answer: China. Based on current estimates, China supplies North Korea with about 45 percent of its food.The two countries have been wary bedfellows since the DPRK’s inception, when more than a million Chinese soldiers fought on behalf of Kim Il-sung’s revolutionary forces in the Korean War. Especially since the fall of the Soviet Union, North Korea has relied on China as its primary source of both economic and political support. Beijing’s alliance with Pyongyang figures into its larger geostrategic concerns, as a way to power-check South Korea and U.S. interests in Asia. But in an international community that has uniformly ostracized the DPRK with sanctions and ice-cold diplomacy, China is pretty much North Korea’s last friend on earth.According to Beijing’s export records (since Pyongyang doesn’t release any), North Korea imports pretty much the whole pantry: “meat; cereals; starch; fats; oils; grains; beverages; vegetables; salt; fish; shellfish; fruits; nuts; sugar; spices; coffee; tea; cocoa; dairy; eggs; honey; live animals; animal feed; food waste; miscellaneous foods; preserved foods; other foods.” In addition to nearly half its food, the DPRK imports 80 percent of its consumer goods from China, and 90 percent of its oil. China is North Korea’s largest import partner by a wide margin, and the trade imbalance is extreme; other than a little coal, China imports practically nothing from North Korea. In terms of imports, North Korea is China’s seventieth-largest trade partner—just below Yemen and Gabon.In 2011, North Korea increased its imports of Chinese “luxury food items”—including about $500,000 worth of high-grade beef, apparently for lavish meals that Kim Jong-il used to maintain support among the power elite. My hunch, though, is that some of that luxury food is diverted to the tourist sector. On one of our last nights in the DPRK, we had a traditional Korean dinner of a dozen panchan served in individual bowls. Under brass lids we found pork sausage, french fries, honey cake, fried morsels of beef, and four or five types of fried vegetables. As the waitress served a plate of rice, molded into a little white hillock, I had to wonder—was this North Korean food or Chinese?From 1994 to 1998, somewhere between 600,000 and 3.5 million North Koreans died from starvation. (The most credible source sets the figure at 1.2 million, or about 5 percent of the population.) The problems started with the collapse of the Soviet Union and China’s economic reforms, which together had the effect of kicking out the crutches from North Korea’s already anemic financial system. The economic shocks were compounded by massive floods, which swiftly obliterated North Korean agriculture.The North Korean government offered various explanations for the food shortages. At one point they blamed the U.S., claiming that President Clinton had issued sanctions and ordered a blockade against the DPRK, which was preventing food from reaching the people. But as the reality of the famine became undeniable, they changed their approach. The news agencies reported that deliverance was just around the corner, that food shipments were on their way. The government propaganda machine began referring to the famine as the Arduous March, a largely apocryphal reference to a military victory by Kim Il-sung from the 1930s. Hunger became one’s patriotic duty.The government announced a new campaign, called “Let’s Eat Two Meals a Day.” As the country ran out of food, the Public Distribution System was shut down, and black markets formed; starving families sold off everything they owned for sacks of grain. But then the black markets ran out of food too. People stopped going to work and spent their days scavenging for food in the forest, eating boiled grass and bark to stay alive. The country’s entire frog population was wiped out by overhunting; today it’s rare to see wild birds or animals in the countryside. Prostitution—which had never been widespread in North Korea—became commonplace, as mothers with no possessions started selling sex for food. In Barbara Demick’s collection of accounts from North Korean defectors, The other famously horrific famine in recent history was just across the border in China. Death-toll estimates from the Great Chinese Famine of 1958–1961 range from fifteen to forty-three million. The cause, as in North Korea, was a combination of poor weather patterns and disastrous economic policies—in China’s case, the utter failure of Chairman Mao’s “Great Leap Forward.”But China recovered and eventually transformed itself into an economic superpower. North Korea followed the inverse trajectory. In the 1970s, China began its long and successful embrace of free markets. Under Deng Xiaoping, agriculture was de-collectivized and opened to private trade, competition was introduced, and slowly but surely, farmers started growing enough food for their families plus a surplus to sell in relatively free markets.In the early 1960s, the North Korean economy was also expanding rapidly; postwar reconstruction efforts were propped up with significant aid from other Communist countries. But Pyongyang held fast to its Communist principles and its stubborn policy of international isolation, and in so doing encountered deep, permanent stagnation. Since the “military first” policy was introduced in the mid-1990s following the death of Kim Il-sung, the majority of North Korea’s GDP—buttressed by government dabbling in the drug trade, illegal arms trade, and counterfeit money-laundering—is spent on its military. One-fifth of the North Korean population serves in the army, and the regime’s food problem forces it to confront a bitter calculus of guns versus butter. Do you feed your people, or do you develop a nuclear-weapons facility? Pyongyang always plays the grand bluff, using its military to force the world to take it seriously.In 1995, after repeatedly denying the ongoing famine and preventing humanitarian organizations from entering the country, Kim Jong-il made an official request for assistance. The international community responded accordingly; between 1998 and 2004, the World Food Programme was feeding more than a quarter of the North Korean population. Ever since, North Korea has become somewhat synonymous with food aid. When Kim Jong-il wasn’t garnering headlines with threats of nuclear menace, he was appealing to the international community for assistance, trying to prevent mass starvation. While the North Korean government officially denies any problem, defectors and underground reports coming out of the country suggest persistent, cyclical food scarcity. International experts consider it entirely plausible that North Korea suffers from regular, brief but deadly “mini famines.”During the 1990s famine, the U.S. was actually the largest humanitarian-aid donor to North Korea. Today, food and the threat of withholding it are the literal carrot and stick that Western powers use in dealing with Pyongyang: the U.S. extends/rescinds hundreds of tons of food aid to North Korea in clockwork-like response to the DPRK’s concessions/threats. From a 2010 policy briefing distributed to members of the U.S. House of Representatives: “The potential starvation of a sizable part of North Korea’s population provides some, but limited, leverage for the United States.” In early 2013, after the nuclear test, reports surfaced that Congress was considering a bill imposing a five-year outright ban on food aid to North Korea, just to send a message.Regardless, any potential U.S. food aid to North Korea would be minor compared to that looming figure: 45 percent of North Korea’s food is Chinese. Crucially for Pyongyang, China categorizes this assistance as “general exports” rather than food aid. As a result, the shipments are not subjected to international policies regulating humanitarian aid—for instance, the laws that require governments to distribute food aid directly to the people in need. By classifying all the Chinese food as imports rather than aid, North Korea can legally keep agencies like the UN from inspecting the shipments or monitoring their distribution. This allows the leaders in Pyongyang to distribute the food as they see fit—to divert the food from China directly to the military, or to keep it for themselves.After a couple days on the east coast, touring factories and schools and statues of the Kims, we headed back to Pyongyang. The drive was supposed to be a long one, so I snagged a window seat. But for three hours, all we passed were rice paddies. Every once in a while, through a crack in distant hills, I got a peek at a village. But otherwise, the road was an endless green loop, broken up every few miles by farmers crouching in the shin-high water in clusters of ten or twenty.I turned to Mary, our student leader on the trip. Mary was the only fluent Korean speaker in our group, and was able to understand the guides. Throughout the trip, Mary could be relied on to provide much-needed insights as to what the hell was going on at any given moment.“Sort of remarkable,” I said to Mary. “All the farming.”She looked at me for a few seconds.“Drinking the Kool-Aid, are we?” she asked.I gestured to the green fields outside our bus, extending to the horizons on both sides. “You have to admit, this is a lot of rice farming.”Mary was about to speak, but then glanced at Mr. Lee and said she’d talk to me later. I understood; anything even slightly anti–North Korean couldn’t be uttered within earshot of our guides. It had become obvious that their main professional duty on the trip was to extract as much information about us as possible. Each of us was at some point subjected to a brief “hangout session” with one of them, during which they’d casually ask personal questions—about our family backgrounds, our finances, and whether we would ever consider a career with the United States government.At the next bathroom break, Mary pulled me aside to talk about the rice paddies. She said she thought they were mostly all for show. She thought our drive along the farm-lined highways was designed precisely for tourism—proof that North Korea wasn’t starving.All the farmland in North Korea is government owned—each grain of rice is state property. Any crops produced along the highways would be transported to Pyongyang and put into the nationalized Public Distribution System (the same system that has failed to provide food for the majority of the country since the mid-1990s). The military, of course, gets the first cut. Rations are calibrated by rank and status based on North Korea’s social-class system, which categorizes family lineage by loyalty to the state along three main levels: the core class, the wavering class, and the hostile class. Peasant farmers are near the bottom of that pyramid, and their rations are almost never enough. Most people have private (and technically illegal) gardens to supplement their family food supplies.I looked out at a watery field. Across the paddy was a group of shirtless farmers, the ribs on their crouching torsos visible from a football field away.“Sure, they’re growing rice,” Mary said. “But do the people look fed? So, where does it go? Who is eating all the rice?”We, for starters, were eating some of it. Over the course of the week, there were actually some great meals. We had all varieties of Korean barbecue—platters of thinly sliced meat grilled over charcoal, or over gas grills, or on our own personal hot stones. With every meal we drank from bottomless glasses of Taedonggang, North Korea’s state-owned beer. On the beach in Hamhung, we had fresh clams—tiny things, filled with little droplets of meat—dug minutes beforehand and grilled by our bus driver on a small charcoal stove until their shells popped open. We ate each clam with a swig of soju (“to kill the bacteria,” according to the driver).But by the end of the week our group was a tired mess. All of us were sick—some physically, all psychically. Taking photos of funny Communist billboards grew boring. Some of the more patriotic Americans in our group had grown hostile toward the entire notion of North Korea—like my roommate, a former Army Ranger who had lost his leg in Iraq, and had hid his military service from the DPRK government. (When a guide pointed to his prosthetic and asked him what happened, he told a long and impressively detailed story about how his leg was chewed off by a bear in Alaska.) We all couldn’t wait to get home. Visiting North Korea is a lot like undergoing sensory-deprivation treatment; you emerge a changed person, but with zero hold on reality.As our Air Koryo flight took off, Beijing bound, none of us looked out the windows for one last view of the country. Our minds were migrating back; across the aisle from me, a guy was already playing I pulled out a Kit Kat from my carry-on and started daydreaming about dinner in Beijing. Harry had spent the entire week raving about a Middle Eastern restaurant he’d found, located somewhere near Tiananmen Square. “Best hummus in Asia,” Harry had said. “Cheap food, good belly dancers.”Middle Eastern food in China—I luxuriated in the thought. It was a nice feeling: to crave something. North Korea had dulled our appetites and sapped our spirits, and now Beijing would redeliver our stomachs to the world of food freedom. Americans have come to expect this as an inalienable right: to eat what you want and as much as you want, when and where you want it. The freedom to diet, the freedom to get fat.There are no food magazines in North Korea. There are no cookbooks, no celebrity chefs, no slow food movements. In a famine state, the only luxury is a full stomach. DPRK propaganda asserts that every sack of grain distributed through the state-run ration system is a precious gift from the Workers’ Party. It’s unclear to what extent North Koreans understand that in reality, the party is bestowing precious little upon them, or that many of those gifts actually originate from their big red neighbor. One senses that the people must know the score; that they have at least an inkling about the world beyond, and are craving more. But they say nothing, and never ask for more. The consequence and potential punishment for even the slightest complaint are so grave that it’s impossible for a North Korean to do anything but comply. They eat their rations, and they thank their Supreme Leader for the meal.Beyond the customs area at Beijing Capital International Airport, the baggage claim opens up to a long hallway of souvenir shops, cafés, and fast-food restaurants. Our group moved as a flock through a procession of them: McDonald’s; KFC; Starbucks; Häagen-Dazs; and a dozen Chinese noodle stalls. We walked in silence as dreary thoughts from North Korea faded into memory and blown-up photos of Big Macs supplanted Communist propaganda. The food tragedies of North Korea drifted backward in my mind. I inhaled the heavy smell of grease, and looked forward to my next meal.food magazine. more at: Seven pieces from Lucky Peach that were nominated for James Beard Books, Broadcast, and Journalism Awards this year. 

Earlier this month, travelers got the sad but not too surprising news that But, money-losing as print travel guides may be, we need ‘em.So much of travel comes down to convenience and (of course) portability. iPhones and Androids change the nature of the travel guide game. We can download our print travel guides onto Kindle or Nook clients, we can use apps like Foursquare, Tripadvisor, and Yelp, and we can use auxillary apps like Groupon or Menupages to find something cool on the ground wherever we happen to find ourselves. Then, of course, there is brute Googling on the ground to find that hard-to-locate Burmese restaurant our co-worker raved about.In some cases, this is wonderful. When I travel for business in major cities, I can find Foursquare locations of venues my friends visited. Is this a hint that I’d like them? It’s likely. Being in a strange town and turning on Yelp and being able to instantly find all the breakfast spots nearby is a damn near life changer. But…Apologies for the bluntness. That said, the crowd is full of idiots. Relying on crowdsourced reviews from Foursquare, Tripadvisor, Yelp, or any other site means relying on the judgement of amateurs who may be biased or unable to convey accurate reviews of a venue. Ever read bad journalism and cringe? The crowdsourced internet is full of badly written reviews working from awful data sets.One case in point: the Yelp reviews for New York theme bar Hogs  Heifers. Hogs  Heifers is a dive bar in the otherwise posh Meatpacking District where bras hang from the ceiling and intentionally rude waitresses use bullhorns to berate customers. It’s a shtick that has worked well over the years. Professional travel writers aren’t perfect. But they are on the road regularly and have an experience in judgment, even if it’s from sheer number of hours spent traveling and reviewing, that the general public lacks.Androids and iPhones have changed the rhythm of everyday life. Imagine navigating new cities without a mapping app or not being able to instantly send pictures to friends. But, for travelers, smartphones have some significant structural flaws.The most important one is the power issue. Mobile devices have a nasty tendency of powering down; print books lack that bigtime functionality flaw. There’s no guarantee of easily being able to charge smartphones; there’s also nothing worse than having to wait around for an hour while a phone charges.More important, for international travelers, is the cost of data. Relying on apps can be golden for domestic travel. However, international travel means dealing with data fees that can run into the thousands of dollars for folks who aren’t paying attention. Local prepaid SIM cards are one solution, but aren’t easily available in many markets due to local regulations — and are incompatible with many American smartphones too. Verizon users here in the States can’t even swap out their SIM cards thanks to the use of CDMA, and then there’s the fact that many phone apps are unusable in rural regions where there’s no reception. For users of smaller carriers such as Virgin, this can be an issue even in major metropolitan areas in the United States.No bars? Congrats; your smartphone won’t be able to tell you who has the best dinner in the next town.Smartphones might not be perfect, but travel publishers have failed in porting their products to digital. While there might be exceptions such as the wonderful The digital products of most major travel guide houses are either desktop-optimized websites, crippled cheap apps with minimal content, or shovelware PDF, Kindle or Nook ports that don’t take advantage of the inborn advantages of Android, iOS, or HTML5. Rough Guides has taken good steps in this regard thanks to full-featured travel apps, but the other big players? Not so much. Google and Apple’s app stores are full of limited functionality apps from Fodor’s, Lonely Planet, Time Out, and others that are only good at providing offline maps of downtowns, and don’t we already have Google Maps offline saving for that?Kindle and Nook’s formats were designed with novels and pop-non fiction in mind. They’re wonderful for reading narrative books. But they’re awful for reading travel guides and reference books in general.Instead of offering interactive maps, real hypertext capability, custom itinerary construction, real-time integration, a (gasp!) developer API, or any of the exciting content possibilities phones and tablets offer for the traditional travel guide format, we have… print travel guides ported into bits and bites. It’s not awful, it’s just really imperfect.When Google acquired It won’t stun any of you to argue that the fate of print travel guides — like that of the print industry as a whole — is tied to digital.But where this sea change creates exciting new opportunities to create industry-defining products and change the way we travel, print travel publishers see only gloom and panic.Traveling with Foursquare, Tripadvisor, and Yelp are imperfect solutions. If those services find ways of effectively curating expert opinions and offering offline usage for rural/international users, they may supplant print travel guides yet. But in the meantime, it pays to be a Luddite. Don’t give up on print travel guides yet, and if you’re an entrepreneur looking to create a new digital travel product, give me a call.I write about the future for 

Almost everything that we know about the distant reaches of the Universe has come to us via traditional cosmological messengers, such as photons, neutrinos and cosmic rays. One problem with this mechanism is that it only works when the messengers travel in a direct line to us from their source.Today, Abraham Loeb and James Guillochon at Harvard University in Cambridge, say there is another type of cosmological messenger that travels across the universe and so can also give us information about the distant reaches of the cosmos. These messengers are stars that have been flung out of their galaxies at such high speeds that they travel at more than half the speed of light and so can cover vast distances.But crucially, these stars don’t have to have travelled in a line towards us because they emit their own light, which we can study at a distance. That gives astronomers much greater reach in studying the universe.Stars in the Milky Way typically travel at a few hundred kilometres per second relative to their peers. But in 1988, the astronomer Jack Hills predicted that some stars could be accelerated by a kind of gravitational slingshot mechanism to speeds of 1000 kilometres per second.In recent years, astronomers have found a dozen of these so-called hyper velocity stars, many of them travelling fast enough to escape our galaxy entirely. This has provided strong evidence of a massive compact body at the centre of our galaxy, widely thought to be a supermassive black hole.Curiously, these hypervelocity stars travel at only a small fraction of the speed of the fastest known stars, which are those that are trapped orbiting the supermassive black hole itself. Some of these have velocities in excess of 10,000 kilometres per second or 3 per cent of the speed of light.Now, Loeb and Guillochon point out that if there was some mechanism for releasing the stars, then we ought to be able to see unbound stars travelling at these huge speeds. And sure enough, they have found such a mechanism. These guys say that when two galaxies collide, the supermassive black holes at their centres can interact in a way that flings any orbiting stars out of the merged galaxy at super high speeds.Loeb and Guillochon calculate that such stars could reach speeds of more than 100,000 kilometres per second, that’s one third speed of light. Consequently, they call them semi-relativistic hypervelocity stars. The pair go on to calculate that this mechanism should be common enough to have filled the universe with these ejected stars at a density of hundred thousand per cubic gigaparsec.As these stars evolve, they should become bigger and brighter, just like ordinary stars, and hence become easier to observe. And Loeb and Guillochon say the next generation of space telescopes should be able to detect them as they travel across intergalactic space.That’s something for astronomers to keep their eyes peeled for. The discovery would have important implications. By tracing these stars back to their origins, astronomers should be able to identify the parent galaxy, while the spectroscopic properties of the star should give them a sense of the conditions there and how much these differ from our own galaxy. That’s an entirely new way to study the distant reaches of the cosmos.These cosmological messengers also have biological implications. “Semi-relativistic hypervelocity stars could spread life beyond the boundaries of their host galaxies,” say Loeb and Guillochon. If so, these objects could become an important target for astrobiologists.Ref:Follow the Physics arXiv Blog on Twitter at An alternative view of the best new ideas in science.

I get it. You’re traveling and you want the authentic culinary experience. The thing is, sometimes you may not feel like accidentally ordering the rectum of a pig at five in the morning. It’s too early to exert that much effort into chewing. Assholes are chewy. Sometimes a Sausage  Egg McMuffin really hits the spot. It’s pretty much the same-ish in every language, and you can always point at the picture in a pinch. Don’t beat yourself up over it. If it makes you feel any better you’re probably still eating a pig’s anus, just in its more familiar and friendly form.If you really want to keep it cultural you might appreciate the “genuine” local cuisine that McDonald’s has to offer: A Bulgogi Burger in Seoul, The McArabia in Abu Dhabi, and in Madrid they even serve cerveza.* Salud!Falling in love overseas is like a carton of milk. It comes with an expiration date. It’s highly likely that you and your new lover are not from the same country, and sooner or later one of you is going home. When the inevitable happens you have a few options. You can toss aside the old carton and get yourself some fresh milk, you can claim lactose intolerance for a suitable mourning period, or you can ignore the ‘best by’ warning* stamped on the carton for your own protection.Sure, I’ve seen it work for other couples. They flaunt their borderless love and multi-country work visas. Their babies come out clutching passports in their tiny dual-citizenship hands. Their how-we-met stories are pretty cool: Unfortunately, Homeland Security doesn’t want you to fall in love with a foreigner. It’s too much of a threat to our national security, so they make it really hard with paperwork and denying your beloved entry into the country. You could try to find a neutral land to call home. My very exotic Canadian ex and I moved to Vietnam, where our relationship quickly soured and made us both sick. It was too hot in Vietnam for our milk.Or it might make you a douchebag. Take for example this guy I met in Korea named “Trent”. When Trent first arrived, he was your average nice guy from Nice-town U.S.A.. Then the Korean girls started comparing him to the likes of Robert Pattinson. (Trent is a short chubby dude, nothing like a glittery vampire.) He quickly found himself juggling a bevy of local beauties who giggled at his nonexistent jokes while looking really pretty in super short skirts. He was promoted to head English teacher even though he thought ‘real’ was an adverb. He bought himself a scooter and refused to wear a helmet, but the police didn’t ticket him. They bought him rounds of soju instead for being so cool. Trent was living on the edge: women, power, booze, a 50cc engine. It could get to anyone’s head, really.A few months later, I ran into a shirtless Trent at a bar.“It’s hot,” he explained.“It’s January,” I responded swaddled in layers of clothing.“Heck, when you’re hot, you’re I feel like I’m throwing Trent to the dogs. I don’t begrudge him his demi-cock status. I’m not without my own douchebag moments. Mine mostly involve the belief that I should be given free cookies because I’m foreign and special.Once while I was enjoying a semi-cold Singha at an outdoor plastic table in Bangkok, I couldn’t help but observe the table next to mine. It was a group of young twenty-something backpackers all wearing the requisite uniform: baggy Thai fisherman pants and either a Chang Beer tank top, a Beer Lao tank top, or the Vietnamese gold star on a red t-shirt, which always reminds me of the Dr. Seuss story, the one about the star-bellied Sneetches.They were a mix of Americans and Brits who enjoyed playfully mocking each other. The Americans spoke with heightened Mary Poppins voices while the Brits said ‘b-ass-ketball’ over and over in their best Forrest Gump. They sucked from the same bucket, a concoction of cheap 7/11 Thai whiskey and a more potent version of Red Bull most likely banned in the West for inducing coronary attack, and compared wounds from their recent scooter hi-jinx while engaging in a plethora of stimulating conversational topics.“The people of Vietnam are, like, so rude,” said one.“Yeah, the people of Laos are so much better,” another agreed.“What?? No way. You paid a ““So I said, ‘fuck it’. Took the year off to find myself.”“You’ve gotta, man. I feel sorry for those bloody bastards back home,” chimed another.“They’re all doing the same thing. And here we are. Doing something different.” And with that they all took a big celebratory suck from their bucket.I wanted to punch these kids and then I remembered.I’m sitting at a plastic table outside a 7/11 on Khaosan Road. “This stuff is probably banned in the West for inducing coronary attack,” I chuckle at my astute observation and faux Eliza Doolittle accent.

In the ongoing culture war over sexual identity, there’s an argument we hear all too often: “How will I explain this to my children?!” It’s an abstract appeal to emotion at best, but the biggest flaw in this argument is simple — the real problem is never the children. It’s the so-called grown-ups.The other day, my 4-year-old daughter and I were watching At some point in the story, the hero travels back in time to steer himself back on the heroic path. This turns into a gag, and eventually there are four versions of our hero all warning each other about various things.My 4-year-old was understandably confused. Why were there suddenly four of what looked like the same turkey? I panicked. My wife, who actually has a Ph.D. in particle physics, was still at work, and had left me, the hapless psychologist, to have “the talk.”I did my best. “What if you from tomorrow came back to today to tell yourself something?

It keeps everything in order, and you’re never scrambling for the exact time the train leaves. Here’s a PDF screenshot that I carried with me:If you’re flying with budget airlines like Ryanair or easyJet, many of them only allow you one carry-on item. One. As in, if you have a suitcase already, you can’t bring another backpack larger than a small purse. Solution: Look at weight requirements. easyJet doesn’t have one but Ryanair is adamant about weight restrictions, and you get slapped with a hefty overweight fee (something like €20 per kg). Definitely bring a water bottle so you’re not paying tourist fees for water. The There’s no need to buy an international data plan. Simply load the Google map of the city before you leave the hotel, and you’ll have a fully functional map as you navigate within the city without WiFi. The GPS location tracker still works, and you’ll never get lost. I usually “star” my hotel on the map so it’s easy to locate.If you need free WiFi, McDonalds and Burger King are your best bet.

A lot of friends and family ask me how I travel often while still being in school. I tend to give a lot of them the same advice so I figured I’d sum it up here.Just to be clear, I’m no expert on travel hacking. There are plenty of bloggers, like Daraius from This seems pretty intuitive but you’d be surprised by the amount of people who don’t sign-up for frequent flier programs. You can sign-up for most programs in a few minutes and then all you have to do is add your mileage number when you’re purchasing a ticket to begin collecting miles.If you fly often enough, you’ll be able to speed through security via priority pass, get free checked bags, access to air lounges, and even free class upgrades.Many people make the mistake of signing-up for every frequent flier program. As a result, they collect a lot of miles but they are all in different accounts, making it difficult to cash-in for a free ticket. I recommend people Some popular travel alliances:By signing up for United, American Airlines, and Delta’s frequent flier programs, you’ll already have coverage on most airlines. When you fly on another airline in the alliance, be sure to still use the reward number for the airline you’re collecting miles from. I personally try and fly on only one alliance (can you guess which one?) to maximize my mileage.Just keep in mindAll credit cards offer some sort of reward for use but some are immensely more valuable. In general, Popular cards, like Capital One’s Venture card, rope people in by promising cash rewards or the ability to book on any flight. The problems is that the value of their rewards is super low. — only 1 cent per mile. Although it’s nice to be able to trade in 10,000 miles for a $100 reward, Ok, so what is the best card? It really varies. The single most effective way to get a lot of points is by taking advantage of a credit card sign-up bonus. If you have solid credit, you can easily sign-up for 1-2 cards a year and get roughly 50,000 miles per card in the process. If you time it right, you can do even better. Last year, for example, British Airways and American Express offered 100,000 mile sign-up bonuses.But, doesn’t applying for a card negatively affect my credit score? Yes it does, but the effect is small (less than 5 points) and it will actually help you in the long-term because it increases your available credit/decrease your credit utilization ratio. Unless you plan on applying for a major loan in the next year or two, you shouldn’t be worried about it.If you’re interested in applying for a card, leave a comment, or Previous Tips on how to travel on the cheap

Being a pregnant business traveler, or one who is a new mom, can make you feel like an alien.Norms for working women are changing fast: from Facebook offering employees medical coverage to freeze their eggs to special perks and lounges for women business travelers at leading hotels (I recently stayed at a Hyatt whose “Usually, when I fly for business from Boston to New York or Washington, I’m one of few women on the early morning shuttle. It’s my experience that the profile of the business traveler still looks much more Mad Men than new American work force. And being a pregnant business traveler, or one who is a new mom, can make you feel like an alien. While traveling for business in my childbearing years, I’ve pumped milk in many disgusting public airport bathrooms in desperate search of a plug, had my precious baby milk seized, tested, and contaminated by TSA, and been endlessly questioned and pulled aside by TSA because I would not go through the XRay Scanner while pregnant.Now I’m expecting my 3rd baby in 2 weeks, and tapered off my frequent flying beginning in August. I’m no road warrior but I fly about 100,000 miles a year. As of November 13, I was grounded. Knowing that many frequent flier programs have year-end deadlines for collection and rollover, I decided to call the programs in which I have status and see if I could put the deadlines on hold until I have the baby and am able to start flying again.Stop no. 1 was US Airways. I spoke with the customer service rep and her supervisor. It turns out I have 2 more segments to qualify for 30 segments (before Dec. 31 2014) and automatic Silver Preferred status for 2015. However, I was informed by customer service that there is no way to 1) purchase the two segments or 2) put my status on hold until I start flying again so I don’t lose the status. This policy basically means I will be punished and lose my status simply because I am having a baby and cannot fly.On the phone and in writing, US Airways informed me they never make exceptions for medical leave or maternity leave. I said I’d be happy to purchase the 2 segments and they told me I could not.American Airlines does not have a maternity policy but would let me repurchase status lost at the end of 2014. Virgin America and Delta do not have any “maternity leave” policies. The only international airline I tried, British Airways, has an informal policy and offered to put my miles on hold if I sent in a doctor’s note, which felt reasonable.Regressive policies like US Airways’ help keep women back. Frequent flier status is a subject of near obsession for business travelers, and with good reason. It’s not about perks, but about making life on the road bearable. If you don’t have status in the world of airlines, you probably won’t make it out of Chicago in a snowstorm in time for that big meeting, or get home for your family. It’s a big deal.I’m often on the US Airways Shuttle -and I make the choice to fly it because that my Preferred status gets me upgrades most flights, priority in getting out when they are major airport delays, and early boarding no matter what. It makes those horrible hours spent delayed in La Guardia and National Airport a little better. And because I run a small business and often pay for trips out of my own pocket for business development, it is a statement of my loyalty that I pay premium for US Airways when I could shop around for cheaper deals.The most public and publicized instances of airlines discriminating against mothers, such as getting kicked off a plane for breastfeeding, are egregious, and draw headlines and protests. But erasing hard earned frequent flier status from women business travelers who are grounded because of pregnancy is a more subtle inequity that I guarantee you, most airlines haven’t even begun to think about.It’s time to rethink.

I’m very fortunate that so many people are kind and friendly to me, and seem to like me around. One kindness that I turn down, always, is the offer to stay at someone’s house while traveling, instead of at a hotel. This causes a little tinge of hurt feelings sometimes from friends and colleagues. So I thought I’d explain it.As with all matters, it’s not whether you have a nice house or a shack, whether you have cats or dogs or vipers. When I say “no, thank you” to your kind offer or sharing space with you, it’s because I need my own space, completely devoid of humans.Yes, you’ll give me my own room, I’m told, and “no pressure” or whatever. But what always happens is this: you feel bad if I want to go to my room and not leave. You have assigned meal times or no meal times and I feel bad if I leave the room too early and wake you up or come in too late and you’ve waited up .Plus, no matter what you say, you do want to connect and bond and hang out a bit. It’s not a service. It’s a kindness. But sometimes, I’ve given all my energy to the event I’m at, and I don’t really want to do anything besides fall into bed and look at my eyelids for a while.I know that hotel room service isn’t the same as your grandmother’s spaghetti and meatball recipe. But I also know that if I tell you that I’m eating plants and no grain, there goes your grandmother’s honor being challenged by my silly dietary choices.If I want to be grumpy, it’s a lot easier to do that in the silence of my own room. If I feel like having some drinks in the hotel bar and not really listen to the bartender, that’s easy to do, too.Ultimately, this is what I believe: I value you so much that I’d hate to waste your opinion of me based on the whims of life on the road. You never know what’ll go wrong or weird. I’d much rather meet you for a cup of tea or breakfast or something than crash with you. That’ll be better for both of us, I think.Agree?Publisher, Owner Magazine 

My wanderlust is incurable so it comes out to be an expensive hobby. Fortunately in this day and age, there are many resources at your fingertips that make traveling easier and cheaper for the general population. The process for my recent Italy itinerary can be applied to any destination or trip.First of all, it has proven to be more convenient to loosely plan out my itinerary first, especially for a big international trip like Italy. For this, I like to use My trip to Italy was made possible thanks to If you are looking for an alternative to hotel chains and hostels, I would go with I like to do my own thing when it comes to exploration, but for the sake of time and distance on a multi-stop destination vacation, it is sometimes smarter to book your museum ticket or tour ahead. For example, you will definitely want to The As mentioned before, another app you’ll want to consider is Google Drive. You can access your Google documents offline, anytime. If you plan to book through Airbnb, Viator, or Italo you’ll want their mobile apps too. Instagram has been my first choice for sharing my I learned through experience and friends that exchanging currency at an airport or popular train station is a rip off. You will save money by buying your foreign currency while you’re still in the U.S. The exchange rate you’ll get at your local bank is far better than any deal the others will give you (One of the best things you can do is apply for a travel rewards credit card that offers no foreign transaction fees or restrictions. AMEX, Bank of America, Chase, Capital One, and Citi are some banks that offer chip-and-PIN cards that work overseas. I used my travel credit card everywhere. There are some places I ran into that only took cash (small vendors, small towns, and small purchases), but that was only about 30% of my transactions. In total, I only spent about $300 in cash, and the rest was charged. The rule of thumb is to use your credit card in the most touristic places (as they’ll likely have card readers) and for purchases larger than $20. Use cash for small purchases and in remote, less touristy places.Also, remember to always charge your credit card in the currency of the country you are in, so if they ask you if you want to charge your card in U.S. dollars or Euros, you will want to tell them Euros. You’ll avoid the conversion fees most banks charge.There will be two main types of trains you will take while in Italy: Trenitalia and Italo. Trenitalia is easy to navigate and there are ticket machines in every station where you can book a trip with cash or credit card. For some reason, my bank’s travel card didn’t work in these machines (they always asked for a PIN which my card doesn’t require), so I had to use my debit card. Just remember you If you already know what day and about what time you want to take a long distance train (ex: from Rome to Florence, Milan, Venice, vice versa etc.) then your best bet is In Rome, there is a Many tourists don’t know this, but the locals Without further ado, here’s my customized Italy itinerary. There are probably better ways to rearrange these destinations, but it worked perfectly for me, and I chose adventure over relaxation.Day 1 — I arrived in Rome at 10am, checked in my Airbnb in Trastevere, and had my first Italian lunch and cappuccino at the Campo Dei Fiori. Spent the afternoon to explore the Pantheon, and Piazza Navona, and visited the Trevi fountain at night which is a whole other experience than seeing it in daylight.Day 2 — I visited the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatino Hill after sleeping in and catching up on jetlag. After having lunch at an awesome Day 3 — The Capri  Naples day tour with Green Line Tours started bright and early at 7am. I took the wrong bus going the opposite direction I wanted to go, and barely made it to my tour’s meeting spot near Termini on time. It took about three hours for our bus to arrive in Naples from where we boarded a ship that brought us to Capri. The famous Blue Grotto can be toured for an extra 28 euros, and even though it is beautiful and an experience to try, it’s not worth the price to only spend about 10 minutes inside the cave. There was another tour group with us on the bus going to Pompeii, and it was a tough choice between that and Capri, but I regret nothing. When in Capri, you must take the Mount Solaro Day 4 — I left Rome in the morning to catch my Italo train to Florence from the Roma Ostiense station (best way to get there is by bus). It took about two hours to arrive at Firenze Santa Maria Novella station. After checking in with my Airbnb, I toured the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore (aka Florence Cathedral) and crossed the Ponte Vecchio bridge to walk up to Piazzale Michelangelo and the Rose Garden where the roses were in bloom (they only happen one month out of a whole year). You’ll have the best view of Florence from up here.Day 5 — A travel friend I made in Zurich last year met me in Florence to do a road trip to Sabbioneta, Verona, and Bologna. As you may know, Sabbioneta is where “A Midsummer’s Night Dream” took place according to Shakespeare, and Verona is where the two star-crossed lovers Romeo and Juliet met. These two little places were surprisingly pleasant and quaint, but most of Sabbioneta was closed since we went on a Monday (Day 6 — Visiting three cities in a one day road trip was pretty ambitious, so it turned out nice to have the Uffizi  Accademia galleries planned for the next day. In the evening, we decided to drive 45 minutes out to Siena for Day 7 — Cinque Terre was the next stop on my Italy tour. I decided to stay only one night in Vernazza, but quickly regretted not staying longer. I highly recommend at least two to three nights in this paradise pocket so you can really absorb all that it has to offer. In the past few years, it has been a top destination for tourists, thanks to the invention of the internet and Day 8 — I was sad to leave Cinque Terre (even though it was saturated with tourists), and boarded another Italo train from Florence to Venice. I have to say Venice was the hardest city to navigate out of everywhere I had been. My old college friend who lives in Italy met me on this leg (it was his first time to Venice as well) and he even got lost among the maze of canals and streets! The Ulmon app helped when his Google Maps couldn’t get a location on us. My Airbnb hostess was an elderly, sweet woman who spoke no English. I knew ahead of time that this would have been an obstacle, but thankfully my friend did all the translating for us. The accommodation was conveniently located next to a major waterbus stop and about a fifteen minute walk to Piazza San Marco. By the way, plan to spend at least 50 euros per person if you want to take a gondola. If you’d rather travel like the locals, get a Day 9 — We spent half of the day on waterbuses to tour the islands of Murano, Burano, and Torcello. Murano is known for its glass blowers and wonderful glass art, while Burano is famous for handwoven lace and fabric. Torcello boasts Venice’s oldest Byzantine church. Personally, Burano was my favorite because of the beautiful colors of the tightly packed buildings.Day 10 — We explored more of Venice on our last day: the Biennale, Lido, Piazza San Marco, and the shopping streets along the Rialto. For dinner, we tried the black ravioli at Day 11 — I spent all day traveling back to Rome where I would depart back to the U.S. From Venice to Florence, it took me about three hours by Italo train, and then another two to Rome. There is a train from Venice to Rome without the stop in Florence, but I wanted to spend a little more time there. I arrived around 5pm by taxi from Roma Ostiense to check in my Airbnb right by the Vatican. To put things into perspective, a 15 minute taxi ride cost me about 20 euros. I’m telling you, it’s way cheaper to take the bus, tram, or just walk. I was just worn out from traveling and too lazy to take my own cheap advice.Day 12 — I had previously booked a 7:30am tour of the Sistine Chapel before it opened to the general public, and I had to really struggle to wake up at 6am to get ready and walk to the tour’s meeting point. However, I’m glad I did it. Trust me, it’s worth getting the early access tour. By the time I came out of the Vatican, I saw a line that stretched for miles around the walls of the city. I can only guestimate that the average wait was at least two to three hours. There were even “scalpers” outside selling passes to “skip the line”. I spent the remainder of my afternoon touring Prati and S. Giovanni by bus and foot. Obviously, I had to do my last minute souvenir shopping as well.Day 13 — My last day in Italy! Sleeping in didn’t happen as much as I had liked, but I was happy to leave early enough to arrive back in Dallas by dinner. If you are flexible with which train station you depart from, you can actually save more money going from the Roma Ostiense Station to FCO (Fiumicino Airport) compared to leaving from Termini Station or elsewhere. Just do your due diligence with the train schedules, and you can save yourself time and money. All it takes to be a savvy traveler is planning, research, alertness, common sense, and a little comparison shopping.

When I started writing this story I did some digging through my travel photos to add here and realized that I don’t really have any where I’m actually sitting and working during my travels. Why?Working while traveling as a backpacker vs. a vacationer often doesn’t fit into the “Dream Lifestyle” image at all — e.g. with your laptop on a beach with a colorful cocktail in your hand. While (as I learned) it’s perfectly possible to work from anywhere, it often is an adventure on its own — try working when there are constant power blackouts and the only place with power generator is on the other side of town; try working when a team of monkeys has conspired to steal your belongings; try working when the smells, the noises and the heat are cooking your brains up.The idea of making money wherever you are and anytime you want/need may seem perfect. “Dream Lifestyle” is what my lifestyle has often been called. But is it? See for yourself.Temperatures in the afternoons drop to 8C/48F in winter months which is not bad if you have the heating on. The problem is that the majority of affordable accommodation in Sa Pa doesn’t have the heating and the design of the rooms includes quarter size cracks in the outside facing walls.The views from your work space are so gorgeous that you almost forget the discomforts of wearing 3 sweaters, 2 pairs of socks, 2 scarves, gloves and trying to keep your shivering to a manageable level.In the rainy season Siem Reap gets violent rainstorms and floods that often damage the electric wires. The electric company in Siem Reap is a team of true pro-activists. At the first notion of potential rainstorm they shut down the electricity for the entire town. If it happens to be the moment you’re uploading your very time-sensitive designs for your client — your only solution is to go try a couple of places in town that have power generators.Most buildings in Varanasi have roof terraces. The views over Ganges, The Holy River, are stunning, but the monkeys that hang out on these roofs are real hooligans. Your wonderful design sketches and user flows might go missing in the matter of seconds.My normal answers to the very frequent clients’ question “What’s that sound?” during Skype meetings were:- “Oh, that’s just evening prayer at the local mosque”Good thing the question “What’s that smell?” wasn’t going to come up.Like in any place so remote you’d benefit from the break from the Internet. In El Nido this break is enforced — the electricity works only at night and for some hours in the evening.

At some point in your life, you should travel alone. Pick a new, unexplored part of the world, buy a round trip ticket (or one-way for those feeling particularly adventurous), and set off with a loose itinerary and an open mind. Travelling alone will give you the freedom to do exactly what you want to do and open up opportunities to try new, adventurous things that will be the foundation of stories you tell for the rest of your life. Here are 5 reasons why you should consider embarking to parts unknown by yourself:So give it a shot! Next time you have a long weekend, plan a trip all by yourself. It doesn’t mean you can’t plan time to see friends along the way or that you should let spontaneity take over for reason (be safe!), but allow yourself the experience of traveling unfettered. Just you, your thoughts, and your open spirit.If you enjoyed this read, I’d love for you to ‘Recommend’ this piece so that others can enjoy it as well.

As I wandered in the streets of Ahmedabad, India for the first time last fall, making my way through the vibrant saris and pungent smells of the open market, I suddenly noticed I was the only white person wandering here in a crowd of busy Indians buying papaya or peppers while chomping on nuts. I paused as hundreds of pairs of dark brown eyes were staring at me in bewilderment and perplexity, wondering what the hell I was doing here. I could almost hear the women whispering, asking themselves why in the world I had come here, to Ahmedabad. They would do anything to send their sister or their child to whatever western country I come from. People stopped as I walked by, gazing in puzzlement at my strange clothes failing to imitate their saris and my fair skin. At that moment, I understood many had never seen a white person in real life before — maybe not even on TV. A child started crying and pointed his finger at me, asking his father how I got hurt and why my skin was burnt and colorless.I felt frightened, disconcerted, confused. But also fortunate. Abrupt encounters like this one, where both parties are thrown back to their own identities and seize the immensity of their differences are enriching situations unfortunately doomed to disappear. Now that we all travel around the world and aspire to explore the most remote places it is less likely for a traveler to experience true “depaysement” as they say in France. We promote a nomadic lifestyle, genuine encounters and learning from authentic locals, but soon it won’t even be possible anymore. In ten years from now, no one will know what it is anymore to receive that look from the people at the market. Strangers will never meet because there will be no strangers. No place will feel new and unknown because we will have all been everywhere. I regret that romantic part of traveling where something remains unknown and unfamiliar and some people stay mysteries. Where it is hard to understand what and why people are doing what they do. Because it demands from you to put an effort in understanding and listening to someone’s story. I say I regret because I feel those days we encountered the unknown are over. We have access to so much information; it feels like we know it all before we leave. We plunge into Lonely Planets, browse Trip advisor and Yelp and there we are, ready to take off to amazing places we already know, expecting the unexpected.I am not anti-global, but I refuse to be a citizen of the world. I want to experience difference; I want local identities to make me feel like a stranger because that is how we learn. We learn to listen, to look and understand. Feeling lost in an unknown culture is a humbling experience. I don’t want us to be citizens of the world because we need the richness of local cultures and traditions to better understand our own and moreover better understand each other. How can you learn tolerance somewhere everyone looks alike and lives the same way? Protecting our differences is the only way to really serve tolerance. I find the idea that we should all be citizens of the world and live in a same global culture quite surprising. In fact, quite intolerant too. Why should we blend cultures when they can meet in the most extraordinary way? When they can bump into each other and learn from their differences? Strong differences do not necessarily mean conflict. On the contrary, they serve us good by enabling us to understand who Paradoxically, there is a growing demand for this experience of the unknown and the challenge of an adventure. “Roadtrips” are more and more popular. We want to be “on the road”, free to stop where we want, free to stay whenever we decide to without any sort of planning ahead. We want to wander and experience the real world. We pack survivor bags and fantasize over the adventures of our future journey and wait for wonderful unpredicted events and often even prepare for them. We want to feel like we are on a journey, a quest for something more than just leisure. We are all longing for an experience that is disappearing from the face of the world as I am typing. The irony is that it is this quest for the unknown that is participating in its decline.Precisely because we are all craving for adventures it is getting harder and harder for us to experience it. Because we alter landscapes, we modify local economy by massively touring in remote places and entice everyone else to go to the same places. Locals quickly adapt to a growing demand by developing informal economy from massive tourism. I remember feeling terrified by Goa, a small state on the Indian west coast, famous for its former beautiful beaches and hippies from around the world. Beaches were trashed with junky tourists seeking exotic getaways. Hundreds of shops and restaurants pervaded the landscape and locals knew exactly what to sell us and what to tell us. Whenever we encounter it, we alter the unknown and make it ours, destroying the charm we were originally seeking for.Do we still have the opportunity to be on an adventure? Is it still possible for us to meet the unknown when we have access to so much information beforehand? We actually leave on an “unprepared and spontaneous roadtrip” only because we have accumulated so much information before the departure and because we have the security of knowing we can access this information anytime. But we need to stop expecting the unexpected. We need to stop seeking for the unknown, yearning for adventure and genuine encounters with locals in order to truly travel because we won’t be getting any of it if we are looking for it. So what is left for us to do? Have you ever gone on a roadtrip in your hometown/ the city you live in? Pack a backpack and a snack and go off to the unknown — what you think you know. I’m not saying don’t travel around the world, on the contrary, please do so but don’t expect to be on an adventure, wherever you go. Pack your bag and off you go — home. Local is the true exotic, because it’s right there and you’re not even looking at it. Wander in your city as if you were a stranger, because you are. Look at the neighborhood you thought you knew with a peculiar attention to what usually remained unnoticed. Focus on what you are discovering, look for anything that seems new and it will appear to you that you had no idea what was going on in your own neighborhood. Newness is across the corner. Surely something unexpected will occur, because really, what can you expect from a place you think you already know?Advertising / Marketing Intern, Freelance blogger, loving words and so much more I can’t fit in this caption.This collection will focus on travel narratives.

Fear. It’s what keeps us from living our lives and achieving our dreams. And it is the most common reason people never step out their door to travel.Whenever I talk to people about long-term travel, they tell me they wish they could do what I do. They tell me about their dream trips and things they desire to do. Then they come up with all the common excuses I hear as to why they can’t:They fear not being able to afford the trip.With all that fear, it’s much easier to stay at home in our comfort zones than break out and travel. So what do most people do? They give into fear and stay at home, wishing they could travel but never doing so.One of the most common emails I get asks about whether or not someone should travel the world. Do they quit their job and go for it? Are they in the right stage of life? Will everything be OK if they leave? Will they get a job when they return? These emails are peppered with nervous excitement over travel’s endless possibilities, but there is also always one underlying tone to the emails: “Matt, There is a Dutch proverb that says “He who is outside his door already has the hardest part of his journey behind him.”Dropping everything to travel the world takes a lot of courage. While many people claim “real world responsibilities” are the reason for not traveling, I think fear of the unknown is really what holds people back. It’s easier to live the life that is familiar and stick to our routines than to venture out into the unknown.And so people get stuck and never get outside their door.But, looking at them logically, the common fears people have about travel have no substance. There’s no reason to be afraid because:Fear is an element that affects everything we do. Yes, fear is a healthy biological response designed to make sure we don’t do foolish things. But, in many ways, fear is the reason why we never succeed. It’s scary leaving everything you know and heading off into the unknown. However, once you look at why you are afraid of doing it, you’ll realize there’s no reason to be. You Don’t let fear win.Nomad, vagabond, and author of How to Travel the World on $50 a Day.

All I can say is these tips have all worked. At least once anyway.So your bag is overweight. If you’re like me you probably saw this coming. I’ve seen other people, not like me, painstakingly pack and subsequently weigh their luggage in advance before arriving at the airport. That’s probably a good idea. But I’m not here to give you good ideas.As you place your bag on the scale, carefully maneuver your knee behind it so that some of its weight is resting on your leg. You might be thinking: Between punching your information into the computer, fielding your queries, and wanting you to go away, the check-in person isn’t paying too much attention to your overweight bag.This one has a very low success rate, but I’m like one of the slow mice in When the customer service rep informs you that it’ll cost a ridiculous sum of money to change your flight you happily say, “sure.” Next she will ask for your credit card information. This is when you politely explain that you don’t have a credit card. She will think you’re weird for not having one. Just accept this. You probably are weird. Then she’ll try to get you to use a friend or family member’s card. Calmly explain that you have no friends and your family is all dead. She will now think you’re a weird loser with a dead family, but try not to let this get you down. Remember, it’s not real. Unless it is. In which case that sucks, but at least you’re not a liar.Eventually, whether the customer service rep suggests it or you “inception” her with the idea, the solution will be to pay the change fee in cash upon check-in at the airport. Now you have a very slim chance that when you check in at the airport there will be no record of this exchange and you will pay nothing. If this happens you will feel really good. If it doesn’t happen, well, you were going to have to pay that damn fee anyway.Tell them you have diarrhea. It makes everyone uncomfortable and nobody asks for proof. I simply explain that while I understand there are absolutely no aisle seats available, I’m going to need to make frequent trips to the lavatory. I don’t mind sitting in the middle, but I can’t make any promises that I’ll be able to crawl over my blissfully unaware, sleeping seatmate in a timely enough manner. The last time I employed this tactic, the disgusted check-in attendant miraculously found me an entire unoccupied row.I like to go with diarrhea because it works for both men and women. Also, if you don’t think about what it means ‘diarrhea’ is actually a pretty word. It’s got the same fun cadence as There are two ways to get in. You can be rich and actually buy a ticket or you can be late to the airport. I tend to implement the latter strategy—it takes a lot of time to lug around my overweight bag. If you do hit this flying jackpot you won’t have to worry about the overweight luggage fees anymore. Your bag can weigh as much as a large elephant. There are no restrictions for the better people in first class.This is how it works. Airlines like to make a profit, so they overbook flights with the knowledge that some people just aren’t going to make it. On the off chance they do all make it, the airline finds itself in a bit of a pickle. This is where you come in. Late. They have nowhere to put you, and there’s no time to choose a more worthy passenger, so you get the sleeping pod and welcome aboard champagne. Congratulations. You’ve made it in life.Potential risks:1.) You actually miss your flight.2.) There are absolutely no seats left, even in first class.3.) You get stuck with a shitty middle seat.How to counteract risks:1.) Think of this as a 2.) Same as above, but you also get flight vouchers and a free night’s stay at the airport Marriott.3.) Please refer back to—How to Score an Aisle Seat When There Are Absolutely No Aisle Seats Available.So you’re not in first class. You can still create a class divide by ordering a special meal in advance. These always get served first. The other passengers will watch with envy wondering why you’re so goddamn special. It’s because you had the foresight to preorder the vegan (strict) vegetarian option. Good for you. Enjoy those carrot sticks.Only once I was bestowed the seatmate of my dreams. A Mexican diplomat’s son on a red-eye from Fiji to Los Angeles. My personal TV was broken so we shared his, cuddling under the scratchy airline issued blanket. This was clearly an anomaly, because most of the time my seatmates are unattractive people with bad breath. If this is the case just move. Don’t ask permission.I repeat: Do not ask for permission.The flight attendants have only one programmed response: “Please stay in your seat, miss/sir.” The truth is they don’t actually care where you sit, they just want you to sit the fuck down.You’ll be surprised to discover that while some rows are entirely occupied, others are completely empty. I have no idea why they fill up planes this way. I’ve been told it’s for equal weight distribution. I can’t make any promises, but you’re probably not going to throw the plane off course.Okay, you’ve found a new seat. Now what? I like to stare at the passengers still boarding, willing them not to stop at my new seat. If they do I get unreasonably annoyed and make a big show of gathering my things. (I know. This makes me kind of a dick.) Quickly find another seat while avoiding the flight attendants. They will demand to see your ticket in the facade of helpfulness, and send you back to your assigned seat.If the flight is full, and you ultimately do end up back at your original seat, console yourself with the fact that at least you got to stretch your legs. Stretching helps to prevent blood clots.Note — If you are thinking: This will not work because of people like me who have already stolen all the good seats.I don’t understand how they came up with 3.4 ounces. From what I’ve surmised, it’s some kind of complex equation like this: 3.4 ounces = safe toothpaste. 3.5 ounces = potentially dangerous toothpaste. I once tried to explain that the suspect tube I was carrying wasn’t full. It had only about 2.9 ounces left, maybe 3. The official promptly chucked it in the bin with all the other sad, unused over 3.4 ounce products. Therefore, the amount of toothpaste inside the tube appears to be inconsequential. The real issue is with the container.When flying from Korea to Japan, I discovered I’d left my pricey coconut body lotion in my bag. It made me smell like a freshly baked macaroon. There was no way I wanted to part with it, especially because it was winter and Japan’s very dry in the winter. Then I remembered: They don’t care how much pricey coconut lotion I’m taking to Japan, they just don’t want it contained. I squeezed the entire bottle into my hand and carried it lovingly through security. On the other side, the security official gave me a Ziploc baggie for my lotion. They have these. Just ask.Sometimes you’ve got to call the airline. When this happens you might find yourself talking to an unhelpful asshole. Here are some signs that you are talking to an unhelpful asshole.Sign one: The customer service rep—let’s call him Gary from Atlanta—will claim there is no possible way to help you. Then he’ll say he’s sorry, but he won’t sound sorry. Gary won’t sound sorry at all.Sign two: After reiterating that there is no possible way he could ever help you, like ever, he will ask if there’s anything else he can help you with. Now he’s just messing with you, but the robots who monitor the call for quality control purposes are unable to detect irony. Gary will be rewarded for his valiant attempts to assist you.Sign three: After forty-five minutes of not helping you, Gary tells you to have a great day! Translation: go fuck yourself.When this happens, I call Japan. Every major airline will have an office in Japan. Every office will have a nice person to assist you because customer service is a matter of honor. It doesn’t even matter if you’re not flying to or through Japan, they will still help you in a polite and time-efficient manner. Here is a sign that you are talking to a customer service representative in Japan.Sign: The customer service rep—Hoshihiko from Tokyo—will help you in a polite and time-efficient manner. Remember Gary and your ridiculously impossible-to-solve problem? Hosh has already taken care of that.Arigato, Japan.Arranges words on paper and flies places. Someone who doesn’t know her suggested rocket ship builder and pizza expert. So those too.

Growing up in a family that runs a small business in southeastern Virginia, I learned to hustle from a young age. I realized that if I wanted to change something in my life, only I could take the initiative to get there. With this mindset, I set out to accomplish four main goals in college:1. Become a better software engineer2. Meet many ambitious, entrepreneurial, and fascinating students from around the world3. Learn from the best leaders in tech and business4. Travel to different parts of the worldI have been able to reach all of these goals through attending hackathons, tech and entrepreneurship events, and global conferences, and with the right amount of strategizing, my travel and attendance fees were almost always covered.I cannot emphasize enough the influence and value that these events have provided in terms of gaining new technical skills, securing opportunities for internships, collaborations, and mentoring, and making go-getter friends from all over the world. And yet, not many students seem to know about these events, or think that they are too expensive to attend.I am writing this article to share resources so that ambitious students with similar goals can exponentially enrich their college experience.Below, I’ve divided the events that college students are eligible to attend into three categories: hackathons, tech and entrepreneurship events, and global conferences.In terms of age demographics, there are two main types of hackathons: ones that are open to everyone as well as college-specific ones.To people outside of the tech world, there is this aura of mystery surrounding hackathons, but there really shouldn’t be. Hackathons are rich environments for working with the latest tech products and for creating solutions that could potentially create a huge impact on the world in 24–48 hours. Although the majority of attendees are formally trained engineers, you don’t have to be one to attend. A friend of mine who didn’t know how to code before learned Node.js and other JavaScript libraries to implement a motion tracking game in a weekend at a hackathon. This shows that all you need to start out with is conviction and a strong desire to learn.There are many other college hackathons on a local, regional, and nationwide scale that I didn’t mention but are equally as fun to attend. Don’t be intimidated by the size or the amount of experience some hackers have. Everyone has to start somewhere.To make the most of these conferences, don’t focus on obtaining and distributing business cards. Instead, focus on developing long-term relationships that will impact you down the road. There are many passionate, driven, and curious individuals at these events who want to impact the world in a big way.Go in with the topics that you would like to learn more about and research beforehand which speakers are going to be at the conference. Go in with an open mind and don’t be afraid to find and talk to the speakers after their panels. You never know what opportunities might arise out of those conversations.These were generally very international in terms of attendees and more business focused.Funding for all of these hackathons, conferences, and traveling can come from various sources. I’ve listed some examples below:1. The organizer2. Your school3. A previous employer4. A mentor5. Crowdfunding6. Credit card and airline companiesReach out to as many people as you can at your university to ask about funding sources. It’s about building those relationships early so that various individuals become invested in your long-term success.Additionally, if two or more of your events are occurring close to one another, think about having one organizer pay for a flight to another. Like I mentioned above, it’s how I structured my flights for Grace Hopper and Start @ a Startup since they were back-to-back events.If you have a travel rewards credit card, it’s also possible to take advantage of reward miles you receive from flights that organizers pay for. For example, I always provided my dividend mileage rewards account number to the organizer every time they booked my flights. Through this simple method, I accumulated over 30,000 dividend miles over the short span of 6 months. Since the airline gave me 40,000 initial dividend miles when I opened the account, I was able to use the 70,000 miles for a free international flight.My goal with this article is to provide entrepreneurial college students who are interested in tech and/or business with a resource to expand their perspectives globally and form relationships that will influence them for a lifetime.I would not have learned nearly as much without the lessons imparted from these events and the deep friendships that I formed with incredible individuals who inspire me every day. To give an example of a relationship that grew out of attending these events, I will be teaming up with a talented software developer who I met through the Piazza Silicon Valley Tour for the Global Hackathon in Seoul to work on our crazy ideas. It’s incredible to think about how I’m able to collaborate with these friends on multiple continents and in multiple countries on projects together.By the end of this summer, I will have traveled to 4 other continents besides North America and 8 other cities in the United States solely because of these events.To get to that point, it’s important to take initiative and start early with working on projects that you’re truly passionate about. Because of the company that I started after my freshman year, I was able to apply to the Stanford E-Bootcamp and garner new opportunities from it. If I didn’t take that initial plunge, I might not have gotten my first internships in Silicon Valley.So, don’t be afraid to go to your first hackathon or start working on that idea. Start generating that snowball effect early and expand your global network.As a wise individual once said,Builder, adventure capitalist, bookworm, intensely curious. Aiming to travel to 50 countries before age 25. 

This week, I will be traveling to Qatar and Jordan — countries located in a part of the world known as the “Middle East” (if you look on a map, it’s just to the east of Africa) — and I want young people like you all across America to join me on this journey!On this trip, just like on previous international trips, I’ll be focusing on global girls’ education, an issue I care deeply about as a First Lady, a mother of two daughters, and a woman whose life was transformed by my education. You see, neither of my parents went to college, and they didn’t have much money. But they pushed me to work as hard as I could in school, and thanks to a lot of financial aid, I was able to go to college and law school and have all kinds of exciting jobs and opportunities.Many of them simply can’t afford it because, unlike here in the U.S., in some countries, parents actually have to pay for their kids to attend school. Sometimes the nearest school is miles away, and parents are afraid their daughters will be hurt or kidnapped while walking to or from school. Some schools don’t have adequate bathrooms for girls, so they have to stay home when they have their periods, and they may fall behind and even wind up dropping out.Imagine what it would be like for you if you had to stop your own education. Imagine being told, at the age of 12 or 13, “That’s it, you’re done with school. You’ve gotten all the education you’re ever going to get — you won’t do any more science projects, or read any more books for English class, or have any more music, or art, or sports, or time with your friends in the lunchroom. And any dreams you have for what you want to be when you grow up — a teacher, an astronaut, a nurse, a writer — you have to give them up because you’ll never get the knowledge and skills you need to do those jobs.”That’s why, last spring, President Obama and I launched Let Girls Learn, a new initiative to help adolescent girls across the globe go to school. Through Let Girls Learn, we’ll be helping communities around the world create girls’ leadership and mentorship projects, build school bathrooms for girls (because sometimes, schools don’t have adequate bathroom facilities for girls, which is one of the reasons why they can’t attend school), and more. We’ll also be funding girls’ education programs in countries that are torn apart by war or violence, and we’ll be working to address issues like poverty that make it hard for girls to get an education (because their families can’t afford to send them to school).And this week, I’m heading to Qatar to speak at a global education conference attended by people from 120 countries around the world. I’ll be urging other countries to invest more in girls’ education and to challenge cultural beliefs and practices that make people think girls are less worthy of an education than boys.In Jordan, I’ll be visiting a school and speaking to several hundred middle school-aged girls. Like the U.S., Jordan is committed to educating every child in their country — both boys and girls, including many children whose families have fled from Syria, a neighboring country that’s in the midst of a horrific civil war (millions of Syrians have had to leave their country because of the violence). Many of the girls at the school I’m visiting are Syrian refugees, and even though they’ve faced all kinds of challenges and hardships in their lives, they’re working hard in school and making their families proud. I’m excited to meet these girls — and I’m excited to share their stories with all of you.I’ll also be visiting a military base in Qatar to spend time with some of our extraordinary men and women in uniform and tell them how thankful I am for their service. And I’ll be visiting an amazing historical and archeological site in Jordan called Petra — a beautifully preserved city that’s thousands of years old!I want to share this journey with you, because I think it’s important for young people like you to be global citizens — to connect with other young people around the world and learn about their lives.That’s why I’ll be using social media to share my trip with you. I hope you’ll join me! Here’s how:This account is run by the Office of First Lady Michelle Obama. Notes may be archived: Follow along as the First Lady travels to Qatar and Jordan to talk about the importance of girls’ education:

My name is Brad, I am 28 years old, and I am addicted to discovery. This is usually the part where most support groups respond in stale unison, Hiiiiii Brad. With that said, this is an addiction I have grown quite fond of and have no desire to kick.Allow me tell you how I came to find this addiction and please let me to start from the beginning.In 2008 I graduated from Arizona State University with a degree in Psychology and Business. I was bright eyed, bushy tailed, and ready to tackle the world. I was focused, as most all of us were, on setting out to achieve the American dream of a high paying job in an exciting field, maybe a nice house in the suburbs, a beautiful family, and a life of what at the time, seemed canned but perfect. Already I could begin to envision the future holiday cards my family and I would send out to loved ones.In 2010 I landed a job that would prove to be the first major stepping stone in making those dreams a reality when I began working for what at the time, was a 15-person technology start-up in Palo Alto, CA called Wildfire Interactive. Fast-forward 3.5 years, the firm was 450 employees strong, and was acquired by Google for heaps of cash. So there I was, just 26 years of age, in the high paying management role I had always dreamed of, working for a company that has been consistently ranked the number one company to work for in the world.I was living in San Francisco, an amazing city, especially for someone in the tech space. I drove a nice luxury car and rented an amazing home with the most incredible cityscape views. I had a wonderful group of well-accomplished friends, all on brilliant career paths. I was dating, trying to find that woman to move into a nice cozy apartment with in the city, before starting a family and heading out to the suburbs. To put it simply, everything was falling into place perfectly.But something was missing...I could not put my finger on it, but for months I struggled to find happiness.Eventually, I came to the conclusion that I was scared of what I once always longed for. That is not to say I was scared of committing to the life I set out to achieve, but rather, I was scared I would later look back on my life and rather than relish in the good, I would instead think about what I could have done differently or what I may have missed out on. I was scared of not experiencing life to the fullest. I was simply scared of following the path that I was always made to believe is the path that everyone should follow. I was scared of regret.With a heavy heart and pretty much no game plan, I walked into Google one day and quit my job with the intention of setting out on a 12-month journey around the world. Within two weeks of that very day, I had sold all of my belongings, other than one bag full of clothes and booked a one-way ticket to Europe.As opposed to regaling everyone with stories of my partying at the most ridiculous clubs in Europe, or sunbathing on the most amazing beaches Australia has to offer, or riding a motor scooter through the middle of nowhere in Southeast Asia (if you want all that, just check my Facebook page), rather, I would like to address the title of this article, and talk about something of substance, as opposed to just telling stories with the intention of creating jealousy.At the time I actually quit, I thought I knew why (I would later find I was wrong). In my mind, it was simply to travel for travels sake and forget about life for a while. I quit life for a brief moment to take some time off to see some cool shit, and hopefully to find whatever it was that was missing. This all made sense to me at the time.But the truth was, I really had no idea why I was doing what I was doing. It was actually a therapist I casually met one night while out in San Francisco about 3 days before I left for my journey that brought this to my attention over a beer. When I told her of my great up and coming adventures, unlike most who responded with animated jealously, she simply looked at me with a blank face and asked, So what are you running away from?. Leave it to a therapist to make you really start to question your biggest and boldest life decision to date...That question however, absolutely haunted me at the time, and truly made ​​me believe, maybe I It was only later in my travels and experiences along the way that I learned something that would change my life forever; I was not running away from anything at all, but rather running towards something, anything new.Often as I do, I dwelled on this concept for a long time. I came to the personal self-realization that through my travels I had tapped into something special that most people do not find. I believe that I was unconsciously able to tap into my innate human desire to discover.This desire exists within everyone. The need to discover is planted in all of us from the minute we are born, and is vital to our survival. It is instinctual for us to learn and to experience new things. Humans do this everyday, but over time, it becomes so mundane and trite, that we forget the joy that actually comes from it. Often many of us are too wrapped up in the minutia of our day-to-day lives and tasks, that we forget the exultation that actually comes from discovering new things.As children, we knew the joy of what it meant to discover. Do you remember the feeling you had the first time you built your very own Lego castle? Or when you first discovered that riding a bike without training wheels left you wanting to just cruise off into the sunset and feel the wind blowing in your hair?I am not saying this need for discovery can not be met in the work place or in every day normalcy; however, the VAST majority of people out there are simply not challenged to the extent necessary to produce the feeling of happiness that comes from constant discovery. And even for most who are, this feeling tends to come in waves and is often suppressed by the blinding stress of our everyday responsibilities. I was absolutely one of these people. This is what I was missing.When I traveled, I saw new things, I met new people, I learned about new cultures, I experienced entirely new experiences, but what was key, was that for the first time it was clear to me how happy these discoveries made me. Suddenly I could feel the child-like wonder returning to me and the rush of this was a high I will now crave for the rest of my life. It was the same feeling and rush I got that first time I set off on a two wheeled bike expedition throughout the neighborhood, free from the shackles of my training wheels and parents.For me, this sense of wonder produced from discovery, came in the form of travel. I do not want to write this from the point of view that most articles I read on this subject comes from, which is to say, this is why you should travel. For me, travel was Whatever it is you do not know, you will never know it, until you know it. Obvious as that sounds, its true, and only you have the ability to create change in your life that will allow you to discover the unknown.15 Months after my journey began, I now find myself in an entirely new role with an entirely new mind set on life, with entirely different aspirations and priorities for my future. I currently live in Florence, Italy and work for a travel company called FlorenceForFun that specializes in running trips around Europe for study abroad students.I no longer own a car, let alone a luxury vehicle. My wardrobe is about 1/20th of what is used to be. The entire size of my little apartment (which is shared with 3 others) is about the size of my personal bathroom at my old house. I have no television. The wifi situation is rough, I get paid With all that said, I am the happiest I have ever been.My job affords me the ability to do what I love, to travel and to discover, and not only that, but to share that passion with hundreds of people on a daily basis.Now that my life is slightly more routine then when I was whisking myself around the world, I have learned to stop and appreciate new discoveries in my every day life. All of us do, or see, or learn, or experience something new every day, however, it is all too often we forget to take time to think about what makes that so special. Remembering to take that time has been the key to my happiness.The lessons that I have learned from my experiences have taught me that I can live life the way I want, and just because it feels comfortable to live in a certain way, does not mean that is what will make you the happiest.I understand not everyone is in the position to do what I did, but everyone has the ability to mold his or her life for the better. Everyone has the ability to stop and smell the roses. Everyone has the ability to ask themselves at the end of their day, what did I discover today?Find your travel. Find your passion. Find what you love, and find your key to unlocking the joy of discovery.Happy Happiness Hunting :)Grows Beards. Wears Pants. Visits Cities. Lives Life.

Setting up an online hotel booking system can be done in following two ways:Hotel booking systems have expanded rapidly over the past five years and is predicted to continue at this rate, or even accelerate. Carrying out hotel booking transactions electronically provides numerous competitive advantages over primitive methods. More over, the hotel inventory, which is one of the most important components of any hotel booking system, is accessed through hotel APIs, which have global data. When implemented with several hotel APIs, online booking system becomes faster, cheaper and more convenient than the traditional methods of bartering goods and services.Hotel booking systems with self contracted inventory are implemented more, for a specific geography. For example any travel company having several hundred hotel contracts in Dubai, will go for this model rather than going for hotel APIs. The commission in this model is more than the API model.GTA Travel, Hotelbeds, Hotelspro, Tourico, Travco, Expedia, DOTW, Bonotel and several other hotel aggregators are providing the best in class hotel inventory with good rates.Author:Author is a travel technology expert and has been involved in several travel portal development projects.Resources:PROVAB is a leading IT Services  Social Media Marketing Company.
