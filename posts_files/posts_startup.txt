Finally the SMS arrived:An SMS hitting my BlackBerry on Sunday evenings used to decide my destination and client for the coming week.I was working for one of the top three global strategy consulting firms.A life packed in a suitcase. A consulting life where you miss out on everything and everyone in life, except Excel spreadsheets. A fancy business life we are taught to be ideal slaves of, at top business schools whose degrees we are proud to hold.After few hours of sleep, the private driver was taking me to the Rome Fiumicino airport so I could take my fancy business-class flight to NYC. Upon arrival, I was checking in to a fancy five-star hotel and heading to my client’s office afterwards.The salary? It was fancy, too. The company was proud to be among the top payers of the industry.There was something wrong with this consulting life, though. I couldn’t stand this bullsh*t any longer and one day I called my parents:My mom almost had a heart attack. It wasn’t the first thing a perfectionist mother wanted to hear after encouraging me to graduate from the world’s top business schools with top grades.I tried to ease her distress. No chance.My parents had retired after years of a 9–5 working routine at their secure and boring government jobs.I knew that coming from a family with no entrepreneurial background, it would be difficult to explain my situation to them, but I didn’t expect the call next morning.It was my mom on the phone:No matter what I said, I couldn’t explain to her that a business needs more than one day to grow.Having had the most supportive girlfriend ever, it was now time I shared the news with my friends who were busy climbing the fancy career steps in the fancy corporate world.I told everyone that I just quit my job to follow my startup dream. Some of my friends gradually stopped seeing me, probably because they thought there was something wrong with me since it was the second “fancy” job I had quit in a short period of time.While the rest of my friends were supportive, there was, however, still something wrong with my relationship with them:Every time I met with those friends, I didn’t have many updates to give them in response to their repeated questions, such as, “So, how is your startup going? You are going to be the next Zuckerberg, right?” “Oh man, we are so proud of you and we are so sure you will soon receive a huge round of investment.”Doing a startup was a long journey and I was putting myself under so much pressure by giving such a f*ck about what other people think.Day by day, I was getting lonelier and more depressive as I avoided social occasions. My startup progress was not as fast as my social circle imagined it to be and I was fed up with telling people it took years for startups like Facebook and Twitter to arrive at where they are now.The only comfortable place was next to my few entrepreneur friends. It was true, only an entrepreneur could understand an entrepreneur.As if the social pressure and loneliness were not enough, I was meeting the mother of all stresses: running out of cash much faster than I had imagined.This was killing my productivity and ability to make proper decisions. I was panicking and rushing to be successful and to make money.One day, I even found myself asking my girlfriend for a few cents because I had no money to buy bottled water. I didn’t know it was just the beginning of such a difficult life full of ups and downs…Enough with the drama: more than two years have passed since those days. I am now writing this blog post in a beautiful resort in Phuket, Thailand, while enjoying my mojito.Wait, I am not selling a dream. No, I haven’t become a millionaire startup founder.However, my freelance business has a constant stream of cash that allows me to travel the world and to work from wherever there is WiFi.There are, however, five things I wish I had asked myself before starting this painful journey. Five questions I believe every future entrepreneur should ask himself before taking the first step to entrepreneurship:If you have friends and family who are not entrepreneurs, they won’t truly understand what you are trying to achieve and the public pressure will be even higher.I cared so much about what other people think of me– so much that it ruined my life.I was so hard on myself and punished myself with even more work so I could announce my success as soon as possible. That is, until the day I realized no one gave a f*ck about me, so why would I?You are no more than a few seconds of attention other people give to a Facebook status. In 2014, no one has time to care about others in such a crowded, noisy world.If you care so much about what others think, you will waste your time trying to prove that you are successful instead of focusing on your startup.Get a life. I got mine quite late.As we grow up, we share more of our life with our partners than with our friends or family. While I was lucky to have such an amazing girl, it was so sad to see many of my entrepreneur friends breaking up with their girlfriends along the way.Doing your own business is tough – way tougher than I could have ever imagined. Your mind is constantly f*cked up with a million things going on inside and no other person, including your girlfriend, has a single clue what is going on in there.If you are not single, make sure your partner understands it’s sometimes normal not to have a mindset even for a simple kiss.Yes, for a simple proper French kiss.Good, then multiply that amount at least by three because you will be running out of your savings way faster than you ever imagined. Along the way, there will be so many hidden costs, accountant fees, lawyer needs, broken iPhones or PCs, etc.Get ready for a smaller apartment, smaller food portions, or counting your cents, which you never cared about in your life previously.The last few months before you totally run out of your cash will be especially difficult and the pressure will grow so exponentially that you won’t be able to sleep properly.Success will come slowly, and cash will burn fast. Be smart – plan from day one.Having escaped from the corporate consulting world, I was thinking I was finally going to live the dream by working whenever I wanted to work – until I read Lori Greiner’s following quote:It all started by little wake-ups in the middle of the night. At the beginning, it was because I was too excited about my ideas and I had so many of them. I simply couldn’t wait for the morning to arrive so that I could start working again.Then came the exaggeration phase. I was working too much because I never had enough of working for my idea and I wanted to do more. However, the more I worked and the later I went to bed, the more difficult it was to fall asleep and the lower the quality of my sleep became.As a result, at least two or three days of every week I was having days with almost no productivity.Don’t be fooled by my fancy Instagram picture above. Don’t be fooled by over-hyped funding news about startup founders becoming millionaires.The stories behind the scenes have so many painful days, sleepless nights, and continuous rejections and failures.The journey to success is long. Very long. Very often, too long.Each of us has a different priority list in life. For most people, money is the number one priority on the list, while work-life balance ranks higher for others. Consequently, people define success differently.Depending on your definition of success, the difficulty of your entrepreneurial journey will differ, too. If money and public success are what matters to you the most, you are likely to have a hard time along your journey.Remember Hemingway’s wise words:Successful entrepreneurs are not necessarily those who raise millions of investment rounds. Don’t forget, they are one in a million.There are, however, thousands of dreamers out there who manage to bootstrap their startups or live so well off on their own, but even they do not make it to the top of tech news.No matter how much your journey f*cks up your life or how difficult it will be, enjoy the ride and keep following your passion.

Stationed on the West Coast of the United States, flanked by the blue hues of the Pacific Ocean, is a city that’s home to some of the greatest companies in the world. 700 miles south of that is San Francisco.I moved to San Francisco two years ago to work for a startup called So, here is my experience. I hope it brings the readers closer to our little valley where we are building the future*.My day begins with a 30 minute commute to work. I take the subway. The subway system in SF is called the BART, short for Bay Area Rapid* Transit. I love the BART because it is always full of surprises. E.g. yesterday, I was at the train station and bam! the train came on time.Many drive to work. Driving in SF is like a theme park ride — the cars move bumper to bumper, the terrain is alpine, and the people around you have the temper of 10-year-olds.Here is a pop-quiz — Which one’s an SF road and which one’s a roller-coaster?Those with a death wish cycle to work. It is easy to spot a cyclist. If you see a guy with one side of his jeans rolled up to the shin, he is a moron; if you see a guy on a bicycle, he is a cyclist.My office is in a neighbourhood called SoMa, short for South of Market. Many startup offices are in SoMa. The name is a tribute to the returns that investors in most of these startups will see in the long run.SoMa is a vibrant area with a variety of establishments like Starbucks, local coffeeshops, grab-and-go coffee kiosks, and coffee trucks. It’s a shame I don’t drink coffee. It’s not that I don’t like the beverage. I just prefer not to consume anything at temperatures that would liquify my alimentary canal.Why is coffee in SF so hot? Are people welding metal with it? The one time I asked a barista (phrased more politely, of course), I was reproached,Odd! Good bread needs to be baked at 400°F but I don’t see any bakeries selling me searing dough bricks.My company shares its office with two other companies — Now, you must be thinking —Our office, like most modern startup offices, has an open floor plan. In an open floor plan, desks are organised like tables in a college cafeteria. However, instead of food and noise, you have computers, food, and noise.The noise mandates that you wear headphones while working. Be careful, though. Your choice of headphones reveals a lot about your character:An assorted collection of desks and chairs adorns our office. People reflected on their lack of fitness and concluded that the blame lay squarely on their choice of furniture. So some people have standing desks — desks so high that you have to stand to use them (or as short folks like myself like to call them, any other desks).Markets are chockablock with these desk+gym hybrids — standing desks, treadmill desks, cycling desks. This is why I feel bullish about my swimming desk idea — a big water tank with an infinity pool and a computer bolted on one side. Noise cancelling scuba masks, snorkels, and fins come as standard equipment.My favourite mutant furniture, however, is the “balancing ball chair”. This chair has an exercise ball in place of a seat cushion. Let me repeat that: in place of a seat cushion, this chair has, a giant ball. It’s a great way to lose weight*.Outside of Chobani, you’d be hard pressed to find a place that talks more about culture than Silicon Valley. We want to create an environment where employees are happy, motivated, healthy, and productive.Since people are happiest in the company of friends and family, we make sure you have work-life balance. This means you can work-from-home; on weekends. Notable exception is Yahoo. They let you home-from-work by allowing you to bring your infant to the office.Of course, we realize that not everyone has friends. So we let you bring your dog to work. Our office has a dog too. His name is Moses. He’s sensitive to sunlight.Unlimited vacation policy is another perk at most good companies. Travelling, after all, is an important part of the human experience. All we ask is that you don’t leave at a time when your presence is sacrosanct for the company. It can be hard to judge that at times so here is a handy table to help you decide when you can go on a vacation:Most startups provide lunch. Given the wide array of dietary preferences people have in SF, it’s a tricky proposition. It is fairly common to have someone who is a vegetarian, a vegan, on gluten-free, on paleo, and on juice detox in an office of 3 people. Allow me to explain these diets:Of course, we can’t talk about working in SF without actually talking about how we work.First rule of working in Silicon Valley — keep your emails short. If the recipient finds them rude, he/she needs a lesson in productivity*. Here is a good email:Ignore the novella length signature; the brevity rule doesn’t apply to it. Put anything there — legalese, a call to save trees, a motivational quote. Not many people know that Twitter started out as an email service for Silicon Valley professionals but didn’t catch on because it allowed way too many characters.We don’t have meetings; meetings are to startups what kryptonite is to Spiderman — out of place. So we have all-hands*, one-on-ones, stand-ups, and huddles. Same goes for calls — we don’t make phonecalls. We sync-up, touch-base, or simply, connect. Make sure you set up the right one, or you may give people the impression that you are wasting their vocabulary.The most sacred psalm of the startup-bible, though, is —This is why our first hire was a lousy mountain climber.One last thing — the startup life does not stop at work; it affects your personal life too. E.g., if you work at a startup in San Francisco, you are like the guy selling plastic souvenirs at the Eiffel tower. Everyone at the Eiffel tower is selling plastic souvenirs. So you find yourself having the same conversations with similar people. Here is an example:This, in itself, is not a problem; I enjoy these conversations. The problem is that they often render you incapable of any other forms of communication. E.g.:Famous investor Marc Andreessen says:That explains why software is so shitty. Many things in the world — like Kanye, curling, and kale — are hard to digest.Still, technology is changing the way we live, the way we love, the way we work. And a lot of that technology is being built here in San Francisco.If this sounds exciting, come on board; If you are already a part of this world, why did you just waste 8 minutes? Why aren’t you working? Stop procrastinating and go ship stuff!Founder, Padlet.Words etc from the wonderful people at Padlet.

Last week I We’ll be launching our first product soon and we’ve essentially spent the last 5 months 1) validating the need for the product and 2) creating the product once we’d validated the demand.Today I want to share the simple framework we used to validate our first idea, in the hopes that it will help other entrepreneurs avoid failure.Validating the demand for your product is more important than ANYTHING. More important than features, your team, design, pricing, etc.Without market validation you’ll have a product that no one will pay for. You’ll burn a lot of time, energy and cash and you’ll end up stressed, probably depressed and definitely burned out.And that hurts — a lot.OK so let’s get to it — here’s how to validate your startup idea before you launch. Before you invest or raise $1. Before you hire anyone.You want to be able to clearly articulate a problem that you or others experience regularly. Notice that you’re only focused on the problem here, not any specific solution — that comes later.You want to be able to write down your problem in a simple statement. A few examples:You get the idea — keep it basic and refine the problem until you can articulate it with one sentence.It’s easy to identify problems — they’re everywhere. What you’re really looking for is what I call a “tier 1 problem” — which means the problem you’re looking to solve is one of the top 3 problems your potential customers are experiencing.Let’s say your (eventual) target buyer is the CEO of a small business. Their top 5 problems might look something like this:If you’re planning to launch a social media tool, you can see that’s NOT a tier 1 (top 3) problem for the typical CEO of a small business — it’s #5 on their list.They’ll be so focused on solving their first 3 problems that you’ll never get a look in — EVEN if you have the best product, EVEN if you have the best support, etc.They simply won’t have time (or budget) for you if you’re not solving a problem that’s top of mind for them — a tier 1 problem.This is probably the hardest lesson to learn and the one most startup founders ignore — “But my product is so great, once they use it they’ll sign up for SURE!!!”.So how do you validate that your problem is actually a tier 1 problem? First you need to know who might typically buy your product. You want to build a basic profile, like this:You then want to come up with a list of 20–50 prospects who meet this criteria. The easiest way to get that list is to jump on LinkedIn and research. Then just connect with all of the prospects you find with a message like this:A few pointers here:Great. Now you’ve got at least 20 people ready to chat who are experiencing the problem you’ve identified.Before your first call, you want to come up with about 10 questions to ask them. The entire outcome of the call is to validate:Collate the answers from all of your calls in a Google document, Evernote, etc. After 5 or so calls you’ll start to get a sense of whether this is actually a big problem or just a “nice to have”.One thing you’ll have after your 20+ calls is an idea of how they currently solve the problem. They might talk specific products/companies or might reference a company process, someone they outsource the problem to, etc.It’s really important to drill in here on the call. Don’t ask “which product do you use to solve that problem today?” because they might not use a specific product.Instead, ask “so how do you handle that today?” and just listen. They might use a product or they might hack together a bunch of tools or processes to solve the problem.Generally speaking, you want to solve a problem where there are already other companies trying to solve that problem too. Most times that verifies you have a large enough market with a tier 1 problem — assuming at least one of the existing competitors is doing well (has traction, has raised money, has been around for a few years and is growing, etc).Be careful if there are genuinely no companies trying to solve the same problem as you. Most times that means you’ve got no market or your problem is too specific to too few people. Specificity is good, but you need to counter-balance that with a large enough market.Whether they use an existing product or not, you really want to identify the pain in the current If they use a product, what do they dislike about it? What is it missing? What do they need in that product to make their job easier/faster? You never want to launch a “me too” product.It’s OK to have feature parity as a baseline, but that should only be 80% of your product. There should be at least 20% that’s better — not different just to be different, but distinctly better.A clear benefit potential customers can see and understand when comparing your product to others. And one that you can position around after you launch.If they don’t use a product to solve the problem, look at what they do use. Is it a combination of email, outsourcing and Dropbox, for example? Is it a manual process they employ 2 people full time to take care of? Search for the pain (time/complexity/cost/frustration) in that process.Keep digging in until you can recite it back to them on the call.OK, so just to recap you now have:If you have existing competitors aiming to solve the same problem, you can look at their traction. Are they growing fast? Do they have a sufficient volume of customers? Are they (or have they) raising money? Are they hiring? Look for clues of growth.In most (not all) cases, that’s a great sign they not only have a good product, but are generating revenue and finding paying customers. Which means someone has a budget allocated for products like theirs (and yours).You also want to set a second follow up with at least 10 of the prospects you spoke with on the phone and get their views on pricing. Not specific, “$5/user/month” pricing, but their initial reaction to paying for a solution to the product they told you they were experiencing.You would start by recapping the problem and explaining your solution to them (spend extra time talking about the 20% — or why your solution will solve the problem better than anything else).Next you just come right out with it:You’ll get one of three responses:If they tell you they won’t pay for it or are somewhere in the middle, dig in a bit.Why won’t they pay? Would someone else in the company? Is it budget? Are they on a 100 year contract with IBM for their existing solution? Do they just not like startups? Is the problem not really a tier 1 for them? Is it because it’s Monday and that’s their moody day?After talking to at least 10 prospects on the phone about pricing, you want 5 or more to say yes to pricing. Not to a specific price, but yes to actually paying for your solution when it’s ready.The huge caveat here is that having someone tell you they will pay for your product in no way, shape or form means they will. But it’s a good start and I guarantee it will stop you in your tracks for at least 50% of your ideas — if you have more than one.Assuming you solve a tier 1 problem that enough people will pay for, you now have a somewhat captive audience of 10/20/30/50 people.If you decide to proceed with your startup (congratulations!) you now have a built-in audience you can talk to about features, wireframes, design, etc as you build out your product.Eventually some of them might even become your first paying customers.You have what I call a Marvelous! 👏👏From here you can proceed where most startup founders START — actually planning out the product and building your MVP.That’s a whole post in itself, so I won’t talk about that now, but hopefully you can see that by taking a simple, step-by-step approach, you can quickly determine whether your idea has a chance to become a revenue-generating company — well before you write a line of code, hire a designer or raise money.With the low barriers to entry with technology (and even lower cost), building a product in 2015 is easy. But a product does not make a company.A company is comprised of customers who experience a problem that they will pay you to solve.Don’t be seduced by the 0.0000000001% chance you can build the next Instgram or Snapchat. You probably can’t and you probably won’t — and that’s OK.My preference has always been to solve problems for businesses — they are used to paying for software, so it’s a much easier sell when you launch.Good luck!Published in-Handpicked business, marketing, design, and technology articles for entrepreneurs and startups.

Earlier this year, I ‘Startups’ have become a commodity in an industry of startup conferences, websites, courses and competitions. As founders of young organisations, we struggle to distinguish Here are five new rules for myself.I’ve been invited to four startup events just this week. Wait — checks email — that’s five. It’s a freakin’ craze. Startup seminars, breakfasts, retreats, showcases. Say no to all of them.Startup events are supposedly ‘good for networking.’ I made an interesting connection at one or two, I think. For the most part they’ve sucked vast amounts of time I really should have put into working on my organisation.Your next project may be in publishing, healthcare, engineering or another industry, but it’s probably not in the startup industry. At a startup-industry event, you’re only going to meet startup-industry people. They are not your customers. Only go to events packed full of potential customers Very occasionally, treat yourself to a dinner with a few entrepreneurs you like — it helps fight the loneliness. Otherwise, if you’re not out selling, get back to your office and work. Or go home and spend some down-time with your family.Then there are the competitions. Innovation competitions, pitching competitions, business-plan competitions. Sometimes the prize is an investment in your company. (First prize, an investor! Second prize, two investors!)Honestly, do you want an investor who comes shopping for startups at a cocktail function? Winning an investment is like your bank calling to say you’ve won an overdraft. Lucky you.It can be worse. I got a call from a major international consulting firm to tell me we’d won a big innovation award. But I can’t tell you about it because I have to pay them a licence fee if I do. Seriously: they wanted 7500 euros just to let us tell people we’d won. Another time, I got interviewed on a startup-support radio show, only to be asked to sign a letter afterwards saying they’d given us R188000 in airtime. (I didn’t sign.)You can also win ‘business support’, or well-meaning MBA students to ‘help you grow your business’ for their course project. I’ve spent days with teams who are new to my industry using my time to tell me things I already know. I want those days back.If you’re certain that you have time to enter competitions, only enter the ones where they’re giving out loads of free money and you The startup-industry press is so seductive. It’s pretty and says it loves you. Being a startup, especially based in Africa, is great for media coverage, more especially if you win a startup award.At Paperight we kept a But in not one case did we see a corresponding spike in sales (or calls from investors), and for a young business running out of runway, sales are all that really matters. For a while, the acclaim is great for motivating staff, and to help inspire an investor’s confidence, but the effect wanes after a few awards. Don’t chase coverage in the startup industry. Find your own industry’s media outlets (they’re harder to find and less sexy than the startup press) and focus only on them.Every office-bound exec wants to love a startup. Like a pet. But no one wants to buy from a startup. Especially big companies. Big companies want to buy from big, stable businesses. They want to trust that you’ll still be around in a few years. And their people need to feel you’re a familiar name. At Paperight, we needed book publishers to trust us with their most valuable IP. It’s insane to think they’d give it to a ‘startup’. We could have put our whole business in a cupboard for ten years, then dusted it off and they’d be more likely to work with us, because we’d be too old to be called a startup.The startup industry appeals to a very real need for emotional, intellectual and financial support. But (except in I’ll be surprised if I stick to my new rules. So remind me, please, because I’ll probably forget: run a business, not a startup. You don’t have the time.Tech, content, Africa enthusiast. Reimagining publishing for emerging markets at Electric Book Works (

When you’re starting a company, there often isn’t a lot of money to make your business grow. Especially at the early stage, free advice, tools, and resources matter more than ever. We all joke about subsisting off of ramen and coffee, but it’s only funny because it’s true. Whether you’re wondering how to build a social media following, attract press attention, build a great mobile app, or find non-cheesy stock photos for your investor deck, you’ll find a bunch of useful tools on this list of free (and cheap) stuff for startups. Enjoy!It feels like there are a hundred different apps built to help us create quote images for social media. In the end, all of them end up feeling like an extra step in the already-tedious social media management process. Enter: We’re just going to state the obvious: getting press coverage for your startup or product launch can be a huge pain in the donkey. Luckily, you’ll find a list of tech-related media sites — sortable by number of Twitter followers and Alexa rank — to help you find the media outlets that can best tell your story. This tool doesn’t do all the work for you (you still have to find specific journalist contacts, in most cases), but it sure makes it easier to come up with your initial outreach list.Where do you find great photos that don’t cost a fortune (and you can actually legally use)? There are now a handful of great free stock photo sites online, and StockSnap is one of them. If you’re looking for images that capture real life and don’t look super cheesy, you’ll find something great here.

The Hair of the Dog is a sports bar located in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Like most sports bars in New York, it has an ungodly number of televisions, a beer pong table and 3.5 stars on Yelp. More importantly though, Hair of the Dog has a single dollar price rating (“$”), which is really important when your goal is to be drunk by 3PM.In October 2013, my cofounder and I were in negotiations to sell The week before my company was sold, there was little I could do except sit around and wait. My team (there were three of us at the time — my cofounder, our first employee and me) would come into the office around 9AM and finish up whatever pressing tasks we had for the day by noon. Then, we’d head down to Hair of the Dog and try to kill time by drinking until happy hour ended at 8PM. The week we spent at Hair remains a hazy blur for me, but I’ve had more than a year of sobriety to reflect on the business that I started, grew and sold. These are the five most important lessons I learned from my time at Caskers.While most startups these days seem to spend money lavishly, we built Caskers on a shoestring budget. We had come up with a business model that didn’t require inventory (much less office space). The backbone of our website was an ecommerce plugin for WordPress that was free. We customized a theme that we had purchased for $35 to the extent that we could, and hired a developer in India to help us build out what we couldn’t. Our largest initial expense was actually our logo, which we got after running three design contests and cost $800. In total, it only cost us $1,200 to build our entire website before launching.After we launched, we focused on growing the company as frugally as possible.Being incredibly frugal was the most important lesson I learned at Caskers. Since we never spent any money, we never had to worry about running out of cash. In addition, being frugal allowed us to offer incredible value to our customers: every dollar that we saved in terms of our own expenses was another dollar we could pass along to our customers in terms of lower prices.When we launched Caskers, we had no marketing or advertising budget. As a result, I knew that we’d only be able to build brand awareness and acquire customers by (i) making a product that people loved and shared with their friends and (ii) getting editors at news publications to write about us.I was relentless in hacking growth. Here are a few days I did it:Ultimately, we were able to generate millions of dollars in revenue without spending a dime on customer acquisition.We were focused on growing our community as fast as possible and experimented rapidly with new ideas. If something was working, we’d devote more of our time to it. If it wasn’t, we scrapped it and tried something new.Here are a few examples of things we experimented with:Experimenting with new ideas to market our company and sell spirits consumed a large amount of my time. Without experimenting though, Caskers would not have been a fun place to work. More importantly though, Caskers would not have grown as quickly as it did.Ultimately, a startup is the sum of all the things you do and all the things you don’t do. There were many things we didn’t do, some for better or worse.Being a startup founder requires making live-or-die decisions with limited information and finite resources and under intense pressure. Making decisions quickly is important, but rushing into decisions is a mistake.One of the greatest challenges I faced as a founder was to ignore the noise of other startups. While other startups were raising rounds seemingly effortlessly, it was difficult to accept, much less be proud of the fact that my company hadn’t raised a dime and didn’t employ anyone (other than my cofounder and me) for a long period of time. Looking back on it, it’s easy to wear our lean operation as a badge of honor but at the time, it felt like we were failing.Each startup is unique and the best way to build a successful company is to capitalize on your strengths and overcome your weaknesses. I learned that I couldn’t be pressured by the success of other startups — I learned to be resolved so that I could build the company I wanted to build.In terms of what I’ve learned, in terms of the experiences I’ve had, and in terms of the friendships I’ve formed, starting, growing and selling Caskers has been the greatest experience of my life. So Far.About Me: I was the cofounder and CEO of @I built Sharing our ideas and experiences

Valuations have gotten high in certain tech sectors in the private markets only, but they have actually corrected themselves pretty quickly. For example, enterprise software started to get overvalued privately, but after several companies went public at lower valuations than their last private rounds, the private markets corrected as well. I don’t see a massive crash on the horizon like 2001. In 2001, Nasdaq lost 80% of its value. I’ll bet any bubble believer everything I have that Nasdaq won’t drop 80% in the next 5 years.I think that early stage investing, if done right, is pretty disconnected from the public markets. The average venture capital exit is over eight years, so the public markets will change a lot by then. Having said that, a lot of hobbyist investors will stop if the markets crash, and that will make it more difficult to raise money for sure. In addition, if you are a VC and you pay a bubble price, even at an early stage, that can be hard to recover from (for both you and the company) if the climate changes radically.Airbnb, because they are a great company with a great culture and a massive network effect.

This is how most early-stage startups pursue marketing: start an account on Twitter/Facebook/Snapchat, write some articles, cold-blast a bunch of journalists with a press release, and hope for the best.There’s nothing wrong with doing the above—they are decent, if not necessary, starting points. But, your startup marketing efforts can be much more effective with useful analytics, conversion optimization, and workflow organization. Below are seven must-have marketing tools to help you get the most out of your startup marketing strategy. And if you’re looking for more, here’s a This tool is kind of exactly what every marketer is looking for. There are so many things you can do with this Slack integration, and setting it up is super easy. You can create alerts for anything you want to be notified about, like when your startup or competitors are mentioned anywhere online, when a specific person is mentioned, or when something gets published about an event or topic you want to track. You can also select sources you want to read notifications from (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Blogs, Product Hunt, Medium, News Sites, etc.). If you want to keep your finger on the pulse of anything important to you, Marketing at an early-stage startup inevitably requires you to do some writing—whether for a press release, a blog post, or the marketing language on your website. If you don’t yet have the resources to hire an editor, If you’re just launching a new Twitter account for a startup, If you can’t yet afford to hire a graphic designer but don’t want your social media posts or documents to look like crap, Damn, this tool is fun. We all read a ton of content on the web every week—do you ever wish there was an easy way to share and personalize your own curated list without the hassle of a full-blown email marketing campaign? Another cool feature? As your reach grows, you can start to seek out sponsorships and revenue models (which the Curated team will handle on your behalf). When you’re a lean and mean startup (or even a solopreneur), this is a great tool to help you seamlessly build and maintain an engaged audience via email.Still want more marketing tools?

This should be the starting point for any startup founder, but it’s often overlooked. Too often people dive straight into their shiny solution ideas without thinking about why they’re doing what they’re doing or considering the change they want to see in the world.Simon Sinek points out in his renowned TED talk ‘If your customers believe in your mission, then they’ll warm to you and listen to what you offer and how. I recently developed If there’s one thing that startups are often guilty of, it’s trying to do too much, too soon. Having a clear focus means it’s easier to communicate what your product is and who it’s for. By trying to appeal to everyone and adding features left, right and centre, you will actually dilute your message and could end up with a complex, bloated product. It’s not as easy as it sounds. Often there can be pressures from customers, investors or other team members, but learning to say no is something you’ll need to get to grips with if you want a usable product. Get the core right and you’ll make your life a lot easier.One thing we make a point of doing with each product we work on at Mistakenly, many early-stage startups often don’t see value in investing in design early on, believing it is a luxury which can be bolted on later like some kind of magic stardust. This is a missed opportunity (and demonstrates a misunderstanding of In the startup world there’s been a culture of solution or technology first, whereas First make sure that you’re building the right product for your audience before perfecting the experience. Also before you build your product, have a discovery phase where you explore the market, test your riskiest assumptions about your audience and discover any new and potentially more lucrative opportunities.Just because you have a great idea, this doesn’t mean that you’ll get funding. One of the safest ways to ensure survival for your startup is to have a business model that lets the product pay for itself. I come across so many startups that are way too focused on building a pitch rather than building a business. Forget funding and find a customer that will pay for your product. Then find another, and another. Get some customers and investment will come a lot easier.Also, if you are looking for investment, focus more on clarifying your product vision and story and less on the (made up) numbers. If you’re a true entrepreneur you should be worrying about the things that you can control (building a great product and keeping customers happy) than things you can’t (chasing VCs, angel investors, etc).Perhaps it’s because funding is so important to early-stage startups that they soon get good at perfecting their sales pitch. Great if you’re looking for funding, not so good if you’re on the search for product-market fit. Without a proven business model you’re in danger of missing opportunities that arise from just opening your ears and listening to what people have to say.When we’re exploring the opportunities for a new product idea, we conduct some customer interviews without ever mentioning a solution. The aim of this is to better understand potential customers and their world, to find out whether the problems we’re looking to address are a pain for them too. Whilst sales are the lifeline of any startup, the key is really understanding your customers’ problems before selling.Too many startups spend months (or years in some cases) in ‘stealth mode’, hidden away from prying eyes, and end up never releasing at all as uncertainty and competition spoil the show. Equally there are others that launch a poor early version of their product in true lean startup style. However if it’s not ‘minimum lovable’, don’t release it. Your first release is just the beginning, not the end. Learn from real world use, iterate and improve as you go, but don’t throw features at it. Focus on optimising the core product before adding more.Entrepreneurs can be a stubborn lot. There’s no harm in asking for help early on, but too few do. There are advisors out there that want to help you, and not just to fill their own pockets. Why make your own mistakes when others that have tread before you can help steer you in the right direction?Accept that you don’t know everything and ask for help when necessary (or even before). Spend time finding a good mentor who you can trust and who has a genuine interest in the success of your venture. Find the right person and it can be a win-win.Build it and they will come. Or not, as is usually the case. Serial entrepreneurs understand that 90% of entrepreneurship is about sales and marketing, although now we have a new kid on the block — growth hacking. Whilst there’s real value in growth hacking it does feel a little like the lean startup movement — that is, now it has a ‘brand’, everyone will be jumping on the bandwagon claiming to be a growth hacker.Ultimately the aim of any startup founder should be to find a customer for their product and access to a bigger market that means scaling is a possibility. Startups that get funding early often make the mistake of hiring people too soon, before they’ve really worked out the sort of person they’re looking for. It’s seems that every other budding entrepreneur out there is searching for a co-founder, but in all the wrong places.

Founder Where happiness meets entrepreneurship

Every early stage startup has doubters, naysayers, and skeptics. These people will tell you that you can’t do it, that you shouldn’t do it, that you are wasting your time. They will tell you that your idea is stupid and that you are burning your investor’s money.Can you blame them? Let’s be honest here, when you first heard of Twitter, could you have guessed that it would be a $20B public company? Or even better, what if two students pitched you on the 17th search engine, when clearly you already knew that Yahoo cornered that market.Add to this, that as an entrepreneur, you are filled with your own self-doubt. You will question why you left your safe job and risked everything for this idea that no one believes in except for you.When that time comes, read this. Read this as a reminder that even the billon-dollar unicorns started off as fragile little babies.To bring this point home, check out these amazing comment threads we found across the web.On July 15, 2006, Techcrunch published a story about Odeo launching Twitter. The naysayers came out by the hundreds. Here is the headline:And here are some of the comments. I especially love this first one:In case you missed it, the commenter insisted on capitalizing NEVER. Classic.Here’s another, a bit longer.Although, I will give the commenter credit for claiming Twitter is not focused… which arguably is an accurate assessment even to this day. ;)One more for good laughs:That one actually names names (CRV) and ponders if burning money in a big BBQ party would be a better use of their investment.Founded by an ex-Googler, Instagram actually started as a location-based mobile app. Here is the TechCrunch article (Sept 20, 2010) covering Instagram’s launch:And here are two comments for your reading pleasure:Oh man that was a doozy. Can someone please talk to the VCs and make sure they are funding real business models. Thank you.One more:I’ve included two TC headlines for Uber. There is enough negative comments to go around and I wanted to give you a taste of how the comments change as the company matures.Here is the first headline I could find on TechCrunch about UberCab (July 5, 2010) when Ryan Graves was still CEO:This commenter wants to remind us that Uber’s monopoly is coming to an end (note this comment was made in 2012):There were a couple other commenters on the above article accusing Uber of being a “fraud” and “complete crap.” They followed up with constructive advice, which is helpful.Here is another headline, just seven months later:Check out this beefy comment. We have what seems to be a domain expert:That commenter walked us through the economics behind the taxi market and why Uber’s valuation is way too high ($60M post). Hold the phones, the taxi busy is very “mom and pop”… can someone call Travis ASAP please.And one more shorter comment:Is Uber equivalent to calling a taxi? I wouldn’t know — I’ve never really “called” a taxi but I do use Uber/Lyft almost weekly.Pinterest launched in March 2010. It closed a round for $10M in mid 2011 and then another larger round for $27M in October, 2011, valuing the company around $200M.The commenters here aren’t as bearish as they were on the others. Also, TechCrunch was using Facebook commenting system at the time and I suspect this had something to do with it. Here’s a commenter reminding us how “stupid” of an idea Pinterest is and how “gullible” startup VCs are:Here’s another shorter comment. To this person’s credit, it could be argued that Pinterest is in fact a “sophisticated bookmarking system.” Nevertheless, it’s a good one at that.So there you have it folks — four awesome startups that got trolled on their launch day. Although we can easily look back and laugh at these comments, there are hundreds of other startups that didn’t have it so easy.Surely there is a lesson here. What you need to remind yourself of — and what is most important here — is that as long as you follow your passion, trust your gut, and work your ass off, the end will likely justify the means. Ignore the haters and do you. Do you. Follow your heart, follow your passion. Focus on your product and your brand advocates.Like this post?

If you run a business you’ll often be asked:I’ve always found this to be a strange question, probably because I didn’t set out in business with the aim of selling it for a handsome dime. I wanted to take control of my life, do things my way and ultimately build a business in my image. The thought of creating something you’re proud of, only then to hand it over when a good offer comes in doesn’t sit well with me. Likewise chasing investors early on and giving away equity before you’ve found any passionate customers.Startup founders should be creating companies so that they can live according to their own rules, not someone else’s – especially investors or shareholders.Whilst there will always be entrepreneurs that set out with the aim of a $10bn IPO, there is a growing movement of people that are starting out in business for reasons other than money. These people want to build companies they’re proud of. Companies that have their own personal values and purpose as part of their DNA. At the In the words of Dave Kashen, a prominent figure on startup cultures:In a recent talk, sustainable branding expert and friend How different the business world would be if we made decisions for the long-term good of the business, not to keep shareholders happy.So when people ask me what my exit strategy is these days, my response is:(Most startup ideas are based on a set of assumptions. As convincing as your ideas might sound to you, it’s important to recognise that they are still largely untested guesses that will almost certainly change once they’ve come into contact with the real world. You could take these ideas and turn them up into a 30 page business plan or take the sensible option and document these on one page.Let’s take quick look at where it all started…Alex Osterwalder’s 1 page canvas has changed the way organisations, new and old, develop their businesses. It visually captures the essential components of a business model, and the various approaches are expertly covered in his excellent book 2 years later and some variations of Osterwalder’s canvas had appeared. Ash’s canvas is a great tool and is tailored to the tech startup world, where uncertainty is rife and solutions are often thought about before problems. This tool means that you can rigorously test your assumptions before wasting valuable time on development. Everything is geared towards I recently came across the work of Javier Muñoz, co-founder, Happiness Designer  Trainer at Delivering Happiness in Spain. In his own words:I can see this becoming a more widely used tool as startups realise the business benefits of having a strong culture and engaged employees. All the research points to happy teams making more money and so organisations are switching on to this. Startups are next.Cue today and my attempt at taking the best elements of the above canvases, along with our learnings from working closely with dozens of entrepreneurs over the years, to create a framework for early-stage startups to create the DNA of their organisation.The canvas is also inspired by the work of Jim Collins and his This should be the starting point for any startup founder, but it’s often overlooked. Too often people dive straight into their shiny solution ideas without thinking what change they want to see in the world, or even question Umair Haque, the renowned writer and economist recently stated that Therefore it’s important to pin down your values and what you stand for. Think of your core values as those that, when the chips are down, you believe in so much that if you took them away your company would cease to exist. However, don’t just brainstorm some values only to then forget about them – you need to live and abide by them everyday. Your values are What story do you want people to tell about you? If you have a simple story, it will make it easier for you to tell people about what you do as well as help them to tell others.What are the top 3 problems (or opportunities) that you’re looking to address? Frame these as hypotheses to test against the real world.Is your product or service a What solutions are you proposing? This section is deliberately small as the solution you design will no doubt change after you speak with customers and partners and test out ideas. Use this as a guide, not a brief.Which customers will be so passionate about your business that they’ll be your advocates – coming back regularly and telling their friends? Or another way of thinking about it:OK, maybe a bit far fetched but it’s a useful exercise and people do it…At a recent workshop we ran, someone flipped this round and considered what sort of company they’d need to build for This can be one of the hardest areas for a startup to get right early on. It really helps to focus on a niche, keep your offering simple and do one thing well. Trying to appeal to too wide an audience and over-complicating your offering can dilute your proposition and confuse customers. As a rule of thumb, keep it simple.The canvas is meant to be a starting point for creating the DNA of your organisation. It’s not meant to replace the business model canvas (or lean canvas if that’s your preference), but rather a way to pin down who you are and what you stand for before worrying about everyone else.Hopefully this will get you on the road to becoming a happy startup.Sparkly optimist and man on a mission to spread entrepreneurial happiness.

Kevin Rose is the co-founder of North Technologies. He was also a general partner at Google Ventures and the founder of Digg, Milk, Revision3, and Pownce. Kevin sits down with The most important thing is admitting what you don’t know and leaning on other people for help. Kevin says, “That’s really the way to take what you have that’s starting to catch on and grow it, and grow with that company. All of the most successful entrepreneurs surround themselves with great people. Bringing down those personal ego walls and sucking in information from other people is a really important thing to do. I’m still doing it today. I have a handful of mentors, and there are a lot of things I still have to learn.”When you’re building a product, new ideas are exciting, but they can snowball quickly and cause you to lose focus. As Kevin describes, “Someone will throw out an idea. You’ll spitball. And all of a sudden, a little tiny snowball will turn into this massive thing. As a founder, you’re faced with this decision, ‘How do I do all of this at once?’ And the answer is: you just can’t do it all at once.” Kevin suggests distilling all your ideas down to a maximum of two or three things that you absolutely In the earliest days of Digg, embracing the company’s fans and building a community were some of the most important things the team did. By hosting community meet-ups, you can build relationships with your fans and let them know you’re thankful for them. Kevin notes, “They will become your most diehard, hardcore evangelists, going out there and telling all their friends about the product.”With new companies launching every day, hiring a PR agency and crossing your fingers is not enough to get noticed. Kevin’s advice is to really get to know the reporters and customers who matter to your company. Start an ongoing conversation (not a sales pitch), show them demos (they want to actually see something and play with it), and give them early access to betas before your product is launched (everyone likes the idea of something secret). Most importantly: “Don’t treat networking like networking. Like, ‘I have to get that business card. I have to meet more people.’ Treat it as just going out and having fun and getting to know folks, and it’ll come naturally.”From A radically different kind of venture fund.Thoughts from the Google Ventures team.

People change, attitudes and behaviors change, tastes change, the economy changes, our minds, bodies, relationships and priorities change. The There is so much invisible, fluid context wrapped around a data point that we are usually unable to fully comprehend exactly what that data represents or means. We often think we know, but we rarely do. But we really WANT it to mean something, because using data in our work is Our capability to measure and record data is rapidly improving, at a time when more and more leaders are trying to protect their status and image by walking the middle ground, pre-calculating every decision and spoken word. The result is that the world increasingly uses and relies on data-driven decisions, from the smallest trivial matters, to policies in large corporations and entire countries. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it’s critical. But sometimes it fails, or results in unintended consequences that we may not notice for years.If you know any teachers, ask for their opinion on the way success in education is measured.

Once a startup raises their seed round, more often than not I see a team slipping into trouble after just a week.The founders may have just banked a year’s worth of runway, it doesn’t matter. I already know the startup is going to die.The point of a seed round is to help your startup stay alive long enough to prove that customers and consumers love what you’re doing. Nobody is going to give you more money until you can prove A seed round is fuel to help you do more, go further and do it faster. Do you honestly believe you’ll achieveThe adage that you should work This isn’t about working until you burn out. No investor wants to see a team implode. But as a founder, you must understand that I imagine a lot of founders I work with or have invested in are unsettled by reading this, wondering if I’ve formed these views with them in mind. Chances are I have — so let me spell it out, for you and for everyone else in your predicament: To be clear, I’m not saying you have to sacrifice everything worth living for to stand a chance of success. I’m saying that if, as a founder, you treat investment as the means to maintain a comfortable lifestyle, and you expect to enjoy the same benefits as a corporate role with no responsibilities beyond the job description, then you’re going to fail.Name a startup founder who was successful by taking it easy.Either you want a 9 til 5 routine, or you want your startup to be successful.Pick one.

The best things in my life happened by chance.Most people don’t know that what got me hooked on startups was working on my book, Eleven years ago, I was the VP of marketing at an investment bank. I was bored with the work and tired of doing stuff like writing press releases for things I didn’t care about. One night, I ended up at a party where I didn’t know a soul. I’d gone with the plan of meeting a friend there — only to be told upon arrival that he was in Arkansas, having just joined Wesley Clark’s presidential campaign. I wanted to turn around and go home then. I almost did. But at the last minute decided to stick around for a while.I wound up talking to Paul Graham, the host of the party. He was a programmer — he’d developed Viaweb, a company that allowed users to build and host their own online stores. It was the very first web-based application. We hit it off and started dating.Paul and his friends introduced me to the world of startups. I’d never had much exposure to them and certainly didn’t understand the concepts behind them or what made them successful early on. I became so intrigued that I decided to pursue a side-project — a book, I’d hoped — about this crazy world. I wanted to help people better understand how successful startup founders did it. I decided to call it I ended up speaking to people like Steve Wozniak (Apple), Craig Newmark (Craigslist), and Max Levchin (PayPal). I learned so much while working on the book. Among other things:The information I was digging up in these interviews was so interesting and surprising that I knew after just a few that I was onto something big. Initially, I just wanted the book to inspire people to launch their own startups, and to make the early-stage challenges much more transparent.What I didn’t realize is that I would also be personally inspired by these stories, and that I would go on to launch my own startup-like company. I didn’t know then that helping founders with their own ideas would give There were plenty of other “accidents” along the way. For example, when we started Y Combinator in 2005, we did a “Summer Founders Program” with eight startups. We decided to fund a batch of startups at the same time because neither Paul nor I knew anything about angel investing and we thought this was the best way to learn.The original plan was to go back to funding companies one at a time soon after the summer. But we soon realized that it was actually more powerful to fund startups in batches — to bring groups of people together in what might otherwise be a very lonely and isolating endeavor. This was really critical to forming a supportive community, and we’ve been funding in batches ever since.Everyone from Bill Gates to Larry Page and Sergey Brin started small. When they first got going, people didn’t believe in their ideas; they faced rejection; they struggled. But they had the determination to keep going when so many others might not have. Through Incidentally, Paul and I are also now married. I’m very glad I went to that party.Mining the tech world for lively and meaningful tales and analysis.

There’s nothing a startup (or any company) needs quite as much as press. We can pretend like press doesn’t matter after we have it, but until then it brings in traffic, users, social validation and legitimacy all at the same time. Those are things it’s hard to get enough of.It’s taken me years of trial and error, the help of a lot of other really smart marketers, and tons of time tweaking language and strategy to figure out what works across the board repeatable process. that has helped my company and others get published in:This process, if followed the way I spell it out below, should work well for you. I can’t imagine anyone following it and not getting published in a half-dozen major publications.On the surface, the process of getting press seems reasonably simple. All you need to do is find a reporter or blogger that might like to write about you and email them your pitch. But doing that well and making it scale can become very complex very quickly.We’ll take you through step by step, and by the end of this guide it should take you less than a day to email up to 1,000 relevant press contacts with all the right information and messaging that would make them want to write about you. Even the crappiest companies should get a half dozen or so mentions in the press when doing so.We’ll cover:Now, let’s go get you some press.Whenever I begin a marketing effort, I like to really try and get into the mind of the person I’m “selling” to, regardless of what it is I may be “selling.” In this case, we’re selling to the reporter, and what we’re selling is that we’re legitimate and interesting enough that their audience will want to hear about us.There’s also a pecking order among reporters. The high-profile bloggers and reporters can spend most of their time on analysis and covering their favorite companies, while some of the lower/younger reporters have a large quota they have to meet and can barely rephrase press releases before they throw them on their blog. It takes a unique strategy to reach the different places on the totem pole.Though there may be some exception due to pet interests, it rarely makes sense to pitch the highest tier first when we’re looking for press coverage. They’re big enough that if what you’re doing isn’t shaking up Silicon Valley they probably don’t care. Our strategy will actually be quite the reverse.One of the first things reporters do when your pitch lands in their inbox is see what other reporters are saying about you (or if anyone has written about you at all). Reporters, naturally, like to see some level of social proof before they make a move. If other people are writing about you that signals that you’re worth writing about. We’re going to use that to our advantage.(The time this doesn’t apply is if you To solve the “What do I find if I Google you” problem, we will build a pyramid of press mentions, starting with the blogs and sites that are small and hungry for content, and work our way up to the 800-pound gorillas.So we want to start at the bottom rung; the hobbyist with a decent following, the small tech blog just getting started, the small companies doing what they can to pay the bills with a little traffic and some well-placed Adsense ads, etc. But most of them are blogs you don’t read often and may not have even heard of, so how do we find them? (This is where it gets fun.)The first thing we need to do, before we can separate the websites out into their separate tiers, is generate a mammoth list of blogs that we can easily import into tools that we’ll be using later.All we’ll need in the beginning are URLs of publications that write about companies like ours. We have tools to find contact information within those blogs, but the tools have to know where to start.Now let’s go build our list of URLs.We’re going to use a couple of sites that rank blogs within their categories, and scrape for the URLs blogs in the categories that apply to us.First, download the Now we go to our blog ranking website. Let’s start with We’ll use my startup, The Alltop social media page looks like this:We see the classic suspects: TechCrunch and Mashable, but also some sites you might not be familiar with: Smartbrief on Social Media and Social Media Examiner. We need to add them to our list (which will basically be a huge Google Doc to begin with).Right-click on one of the sites in red, and click on the scraper tool.Then click “export to Google Docs.”Now we have a a fairly decent list of sites with their URLs that might write about us.Repeat the process in as many categories as exactly match your company (I would do journalism as well), and then we’ll switch over to BlogRank is a bit more complicated to scrape from. First, search for your category using the search bar. It will ask you to select a “view,” but it doesn’t really matter what view you choose, since we’ll be scraping them all anyway.Again, we’re going to right click on the name of a blog, and say “scrape.” You’ll see the scraper tool pop up just as it did with AllTop, but this time it only appears to pull in one blog. It’s not scraping all of the content we want it to, because BlogRank is set up in HTML tables. We need to modify what the scraper is looking for.With the scraper window still open, we’re going to edit the XPath reference at the top-left of the tool.The XPath probably says something like//div[3]/table[2]/tbody/tr[2]/td/a. All we have to do to make it scrape everything is to change the final number in tr[2] (which stands for “table row 2”) to tr[*], which tells the scraper to gather every row.So change our XPath reference should now be //div[3]/table[2]/tbody/tr[*]/td/a. Click “scrape” at the bottom of the tool, and your results on the right side should look like they did for Alltop. We’re ready to export to Google Docs.Repeat the process for any other categories in BlogRank, and we should have a list of hundreds of blogs relevant to what we want to target.We’ll expand the list with one more hack later, but we’ll treat that separately, so we’ll just work with this for now.There are some duplicates, and scraping BlogRank brought in the URLs for the RSS feeds as well (which we don’t want), so we need to clean this list up before we can manipulate and import it.If we take the BlogRank Google Docs we just created, we can see that the odd rows from row 3 on only contain the RSS URLs we don’t want. Let’s get rid of those.This is a bit hack-y and I’m sure there’s a better way, but it works for me. In cell C1, enter the following =MOD(ROW(),2), then copy that formula down (once your cursor turns into the cross when hovering over the bottom-right corner of the cell) to the rest of the spreadsheet. The result should be every odd C cell (C1, C3, C5, etc.) containing a “1” and every even C cell (C2, C4, C6) containing a “0”.Now select the entire C column, click on “Data” and select “Sort sheet by column The numbers in column C won’t change, but the rest of your sheet will be nicely separated out for easy deletion. Find anything that’s empty in column A and delete its row. Once you’ve done this, you should have a column that is strictly blog URLs that we can import into the tools we’ll use later.Do this for each Google Doc spreadsheet you created, and then combine them into one giant list — hopefully it’s over 700 total sites at this point.We will inevitably have some duplicates, so once we have everything combined let’s get rid of them.In the new cell C1, enter =UNIQUE(A:B) and hit “enter.” This should create a list with only the unique entries in columns C and D. You can’t yet delete columns A and B, since they’re linked to columns C and D using a formula, so copy and paste the values from columns C and D and paste them in a fresh Google Doc.What you just created is an enormous list of all of the top blog URLs in the categories and industries that would be most likely to write about you. Give yourself a pat on the back; that’s pretty awesome. But we’re only getting started — before we start building a press kit and sending out emails, there’s yet another way to generate a list. This list takes a Getting a list of blogs in our Thankfully the good folks over at All we have to do is go to their This is, of course, much easier to use and manipulate than our other list. I haven’t found anything of a particular region to be of any value, so I would delete those (unless you’re from that region or your product is specifically relevant there), but other than that I would leave the .CSV file as is, or copy and paste the information into your Google Doc.The entire process can be a bit annoying, but if you combined the two methods you should have over 1,000 URLs, and it should have only taken you a few minutes.It will be easy to go from URL to email address later (I promise), so let’s put together something to send the reporters.News isn’t worthy of publishing just because it exists. Part of the job of any journalist or reporter is curation — deciding what is worthy of being published in their publication, whether that be a blog or the New York Times. Your job as someone looking for press is to show them how you meet their standards and/or would be interesting to their audience.We could go into all sorts of journalistic principles that determine why something makes it into a publication and what principles they use, but really it’s just common sense.Is it timely? Is it relevant? Is it interesting? Why would someone like Again, we’ll take my startup, What Grasswire Not many people want to read about yet another social media tool. People love to read about freedom.So in the initial pitch we won’t go deep into detail about how the technology works, what APIs we pull from, why the UI/UX look like they do, etc. We talk about the story of Grasswire. What we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and why it needs to be done. Reporters don’t like products very often, but they always love missions.Grasswire also had the benefit of the angle that I lived in my car for three months to get it off the ground; that’s interesting to anyone, if only to understand how I lived in a car, where I slept, where I showered, etc. That also goes in the arsenal, and should be mentioned when we’re sending our email, and kept in mind as we develop our press kit, which it is now time to do.Now we have an The Press Kit, basically a .zip file of all of the content for the reporter to use, will vary from startup to startup. A press kit should include the following:The Grasswire press kit included another document we called the “Grasswire Story,” because the idea that I lived in my car for a few months to get it off the ground was quite compelling. If you can think of anything else specific to your company that would make for an interesting story, include it in a separate document.The company overview is a very simple document that explains who you are and what you do. Think of it as an elevator pitch for newspapers.For Grasswire we included a tagline, a one-sentence description, three “how it works” paragraphs, and a bit of a call to action. An example might look something like this (note: this is a press kit for a real company we did work for, and it got them more than a little bit of Of course, Underwater Audio is fairly easy to describe — they sell waterpoof iPods. Your company might be a little bit more nebulous, but you should be able to nail it down to both a one-sentence description and a short explanation that’s not more than a couple paragraphs.I like to start out pretending like I’m explaining a company to a five-year-old, then making my explanation more technical and detailed from there if necessary.Yes, this can be a bit weird, but some publications really like them. Send headshots if you have to, but really if there’s an interesting angle to your story you can tell them through your founder photos as well. Most of the Grasswire team photos were published because my co-founder and I were standing in front of the car where I lived while we got Grasswire off the ground. Underwater Audio’s might be something underwater with a waterproof iPod demoing the product. These are rarely used, so you can go out on a limb. Put them all in a folder.I’ve had some reporters ask for .ai or .psd folders that will scale better, while most prefer simple .png logos. It’s not difficult to throw them all in a folder, send them off, and let the reporters decide.This is basically to show some social proof; it’s just a document with links to other articles that have been written about you.The most important of these three are screenshots. It’s really difficult to explain how a product works without a visual; everything seems incredibly abstract. Include any other product demo videos or photographs that a reporter may want to include. Remember the strategy here is to give them every piece of content they could possibly use, and let them decide what is relevant for their type of media.We’re almost ready to start systematically gathering reporters’ emails and sending them our press kit, but first we need some text to populate the email.Ask 10 reporters what they would like to see in press pitches, and all 10 of them will say “keep it short.” And when they say short, they mean it — looking through our press pitches, anything that was longer than two Here’s the general framework for an email that works really well.The most important part of that email, to wax Steve Jobs-like, is what isn’t there. No long introductions, no links, no videos, no demos, just “We’re here, are you interested?” I’ve also gone back and forth with varying levels of personalization, a la “I read your article about x and I really liked y” or “I’m a huge fan of your work” enough to make it clear that an email is really personalized, but the difference in results has been negligible, especially if you don’t put in the research to understand writer or his publication. (I accidentally told a TechCrunch writer I like his work in PandoDaily once. That is the only angry response I’ve ever received.)It’s really easy for a reporter to hit reply and say “Yeah, send me what you’ve got,” and then you’re introduced and talking. It can be tempting to send 1,000 press kits out or tons of links on the initial email, but trust me: This gets much better results.Also note that you’ll want to avoid links, especially considering you’ll be sending about emails in bulk. 1,000 similar emails with the same link will look really spammy to email providers, and you will probably start hitting spam folders.So we’ve got a press kit ready, some email text to send, and list of sites to send them to. It’s time to start gathering some email addresses and sending some emails (this is, surprisingly enough, the same step).To save us hours of time we’re going to use Open up your BuzzStream account, and you’ll see this page:Hit “paste URLs” and paste the URLs from your Google Docs (you still have them, right?)Click “add websites,” and wait a minute for BuzzStream to do its job. It usually takes somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes for it to process 1,000 websites.What you have now is a giant list of websites with email addresses, Twitter handles, etc.I use “domain authority” as the best sort method to decide how legitimate a blog or website is. Generally the biggest (TechCrunch, Wired, etc.) will be 90+; really, really good blogs will be 80+. Anything 40–70 is either a smaller blog or a mommy/amateur blog.If you’re looking to go straight to the top, look at 80–100. If you’re looking to start at the bottom and build your way up in legitimacy, go for the 40–70. I don’t even bother with anything that has a domain authority lower than 30.Now we have our list; let’s go to work.The temptation here is going to be to send a mass email blast. Fight that temptation.Even if it takes us a couple days to pore through and send out 500 really good emails, it will be worth it. I promise.Buzzstream makes it easy for you to take an email template and fill it in with variables (e.g. “[firstname]” or “[sitename]”. Once it finds the right contact info it will automatically plug that information in, so you could be pretty close to simply hitting “send” for every email you write and moving on to the next site.It’s also possible to reach out on Twitter; but this doesn’t scale very well.First, if there are one or two blogs that would be your ideal publications. Find the ideal person there, and reach out to them on Twitter. Try sending a message somewhat like this:This creates a bit of a personal relationship, and if you’re vague enough and your angle is interesting enough, few will refuse to give you their email address.I like to send two tweets, but of course refrain from tweeting at 50 people. First because that’s annoying, second because the other reporters will see you blindly reaching out, and third because you’ll be suspended from Twitter for spamming.Some reporters’ contact info won’t be brought up as well as some others, but make sure to find the right person to contact. If you’re Grasswire, don’t email the person who writes about The Internet of Things. It’s worth spending twice as much time to find the right person.Now we’re going to open up the “BuzzBar,” which will let us go through our list of websites, open them up, and pull and send information to contacts. It will track the emails we’ve sent, remind us to send follow-ups, and let us get rid of the sites we don’t like.I try to send 500/day if I’m working a full day (yes, it’s a full day’s work to send 500 emails). That’s because you should try to understand who the person receiving the pitch is and speak specifically to them. If you’re copying and pasting or just hitting “send” you’re doing it wrong.If you don’t receive a response after a couple days, you can use BuzzStream to follow up. But don’t be annoying.Remember that running a company is a marathon, not a sprint (a startup is kind of a sprint then a marathon), and you may want to get coverage from these reporters again. So be cordial, don’t burn any bridges, and be grateful if anyone writes about you.Let me know how it worked for you on Co-founder of Grasswire.A complete, step-by-step guide to getting traction.

If you look at many of the giant tech “unicorns” —private companies with over $1 billion valuation — and the major players in the public markets such as Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Google, and Amazon, you will find that the founders were often software or electrical engineers.Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon.com, graduated from Princeton summa cum laude with two Bachelor of Science degrees in electrical engineering and computer science. In So what if you are not a technical founder, engineer, or software programmer? Should you quit now because you’re wasting your time?No.To be fair, first we must realize that everyone started out as a non-technical person. Through education, experience, passion, and training, these people learned a specific “hard” skill.You can do the same.There is nothing stopping you from taking online courses to learn how to code, going back to graduate school for engineering, or reading books and practicing graphic design.Okay, back to the point. This post is for the non-technical founder who has no time, money, or desire to become a technical founder. In other words, you are an entrepreneur, business(wo)man, or, what I like to call a “generalist” — someone who has many passions that to choose just one would be anguish. The opposite of a generalist is a specialist. The specialist tends to be a technical person, with one passion/skill.To launch a startup as a non-technical founder, you will need the proper mindset and skillset.You must understand that the technical person needs you as much as you need them. But what do they need from you?Travis Biziorek, CEO and non-technical co-founder of Travis is right. Your mindset is full of ideas and execution plans. Growth opportunities. Designs. Products. Pitches. You see the future. You see how you can help people and because of this, you cannot sleep. Often, a designer or developer “specialist” does not see the big picture like you do because they are so focused on syntax and strokes.From Travis’ answer above, we see the four “assets” a non-technical cofounder brings to the table:To hone these skills, we are going to look at the four things an entrepreneur should do, constantly:Just as a programmer researches new SDKs, or a graphic designer watches tutorials, an entrepreneur reads business books, especially the stories of other entrepreneurs.For a short reading list for entrepreneurs, I recommend the following:Reading, for me, is not about knowledge growth. It is about getting practical ideas and inspirations I can apply to my current projects as I read. I hold the book in one hand and a pencil in the other. As I read, I write down the ideas that come to my head for my startup, my clients, and my full-time job. I think laterally. If the author sold on Amazon, what would I sell on Amazon? If the author wrote an ebook in three weeks, what would the title be of the ebook I write in three weeks?Reading, for me, is about idea generation.Ideas begin in your mind, but will end there unless they are written down. Keep a business idea journal. Jot every idea down in a In today’s digital age, writing is the number one way to build a community online. An entrepreneur needs to bring The strength of an entrepreneur is reflected in the strength of his/her network. While technical people can build or design on their own, and entrepreneur needs to find the right people. Often, an entrepreneur is the one that knits a project together; he finds the “right people to put in the right seat on the right bus.”Josh Chandler, a young UK-based entrepreneur, said a strong network is critical to the success of a young entrepreneur. In his article, As a non-technical founder, you may believe that it would be so much easier if you were able to build the product yourself. But there are plenty of non-technical entrepreneurs-now-billionaires who did not lift a finger to build.Whether you have a background in philosophy or media, it does not require a technical or academically prestigious background to be successful as an entrepreneur. Branson and Hoffman will be the first to tell you that There are lessons you will only learn by failing. Of course, to learn from failure means that you have to ACT. If you call yourself an entrepreneur, and tell groups of people all about your ideas, but never act… then you are merely a thinker and a talker. An entrepreneur earns his stripes by executing.The fear of failure winnows the thinkers and talkers from the doers. The entrepreneur has this fear, too, yet soldiers forth.Failure is a skill of the entrepreneur. She learns from it, builds relationships from it, and develops strategies from it to use in the future. My One of my favorite quotes in the last year was spoken by an entrepreneur on Reddit. He said:Talking about ideas is easy. Taking action is difficult. Failing is more difficult. Taking action after failure is the pathway to success.Do you need a technical degree/skill to succeed as a founder? No. But it would not hurt.What should the mindset of a non-technical founder be? Inspiration. Have a strong vision with creativity and passion.What should the skillset of a non-technical founder be? Read, write, network, and fail (act). These will influence your mind and train you to be the entrepreneur your technical partners need you to be to launch a startup.Writer.

For sanity reasons, this ignores ‘ly’ and ‘able’ startups (i want to spend the rest of my life everywhere, with everyone, one to one, always, forever, nowA Pandaemonium Revolver Collection. Season 2 stars 

Rewind back to five years ago, and I was helping some of the most incredible startups on the planet to find and acquire domain names. Now, as a startup co-founder myself for the past three years, I find that many of my fellow founders still call on me as the former “domain guy” to help them navigate the waters of domain negotiation.The domain name market is a mercurial one; it’s relatively secretive, however not by choice. When most people approach me about a domain they’re trying to buy I usually hear the same thing, “it looks like a squatter has it, what should I do?”So I thought it was time to take my experience in buying, selling, and brokering millions of dollars in domain names and share the same advice and step-by-step process that I share with my friends and startup founders around the world. First things first; let’s separate “Cybersquatters” from “Domainers” because they are very different and so is the way in which you approach each. Cybersquatters are people who violate an existing Trademark or buy typos of your brand in order to either extort or damage your brand.You have the right to get domain names that are legitimately being “squatted” on through a process called the UDRP. You can read more about it here and email me if you want recommendations for great attorneys who can squash squatters and get a domain that should rightfully belong to you.Domainers (or Domain Investors) are not Cybersquatters, they aren’t breaking any laws, and in fact they tend to be the most reasonable when it comes to selling domains since they have so many and understand the market so well.The first underlying principal to understand when it comes to domain names is pricing. This one principal is what usually throws everyone off when it comes to domain negotiation, so let me explain it the way I normally do:I usually group domain owners into three categories; individuals who bought the domain for personal use, domain investors who bought the domain as an investment, and companies that bought the domain to potentially use one day. The price of the domain is highly dependent on which category the owner falls into. This also means that before you do anything you need to understand who owns the domain that you want to buy.There are a million WHOIS services out there that can show you who owns a domain name, but I highly recommend using Just looking at the WHOIS information for a domain name will just about instantly tell you which category the owner falls in. Here’s your cheat sheet:- if the domain owner is listed as a person (without a company name) and owns only a handful of domains, it is very likely to be an individual who bought the domain name for personal use- if the domain owner is listed as a person who has hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of domain names, it is very likely that this is a domain investor- if the domain owner is listed as a company that you’ve never heard of , Google search it and determine if this is a small business or startup that you just haven’t heard of, or if it is a company that buys, sells or brokers domain names. One simple Google search and you’ll know instantlywhich one it is After this, you’ll know if this domain name is owned by a company or a domain investor.- if the domain owner is listed as a well-known company, i.e. Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. then, no surprises here, it’s owned by a large companyIn step three, I’ll detail how determining which category the domain owner falls into plays a role in the negotiation strategy that you should take. First, you need to do a bit more research to build your information advantage.Before reaching-out to the domain owner, you should do some research. All of the research you need to do can be done for free and should take less than five minutes.. There are three things you want to determine:1) Is the domain already for sale, and, if so, for how much?2) Is the domain being actively used?3) How much have similar domains names sold for recently?1) Is the domain name listed for sale on a popular domain marketplace? Check 2) Go to the domain name in a browser and look — is there a blank page? A parking page (i.e. page full of text-link ads)? If so, then nothing is being done with the domain. If you see a blog, company website, etc. then the domain a. Scroll to the bottom of the site and look for a Copyright mark, if there is one, is it current?b. Look at the privacy policy and terms of service. Is the year listed current?c. If the website is a blog, when was the last time a post was published?3) There are a few places you can quickly reference to find similar domain names. Just like “comps” in real estate, this will give you a point of comparison to both set realistic expectations with yourself and use as ammo in your negotiation.a. b. c. You should now know a few things before reaching-out to a domain owner:- the price the domain owner has in mind for the domain- if the domain name is - what similar domain names have historically sold forArmed with this knowledge you’re now ready to reach-out to the domain owner. This is where understanding which category the owner falls into really matters.In step one you should have been able to easily locate the domain owners email address and potentially their phone number as well.Your strategy for outreach should be different based upon who owns it. The biggest challenge with individual domain owners is that they typically have given some sentimental value to the domain name, and more importantly, they often aren’t aware of typical domain name resale prices.With this type of domain name owner it will probably be important to have a solid list of 3–5 similar domain sales ready in case the domain owner has ridiculous price expectations.To get started, email the domain owner and let them know you’re interested in potentially buying this domain name but you want to know what price they have in mind.If you hear back and the price is in your budget, congratulations. Of course like most things in life, it’s rarely this easy. You will most likely either get radio silence or get an answer like, “I’m not sure, I never thought about selling it” or “I’m not sure, I always planned on developing it myself”If you can’t get a price out of the owner ask if you can at least get a range. The idea is simple — you don’t want to be the first person to throw out a price unless you absolutely have to.At some point in the negotiation you’ll probably have to reference those 3–5 similar domain sales you found to educate the domain owner on what the market price is for names like these. Hopefully this, with a bit of the negotiating prowess that you may have as a startup founder (since you already have to negotiate like it’s going out of style, most-likely on a daily basis) will hopefully allow you to reach a price that works for both of you.As I always say, this really is your best-case scenario. Unlike individual owners, domain investors tend to have hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of domain names — the domain in question is only one of many.Domain name owners also buy and sell domain names regularly, so they are aware of market value and probably won’t have any sentimental issues or arbitrary price assignments.The main difference in how you reach out to a domain investor is realizing you’re probably going to need to name a price to get a response. Most investors also know that it’s better to get a price from the other party before he throws out a price. Start by sending an email asking for a price, but be prepared to get nothing back. You can email again to make sure they received the first email, but in many cases you’re going to have to make a reasonable offer.If you do have to name a price, use the comparable sales as a guide and don’t make an insultingly low offer. You’re not going to be able to buy a monster one-word .COM for $500. The comparable sales you researched should give you a good idea of the price range that you’ll be working in. Sure, you can start at the low end of the range, but don’t go so low that the domain owner doesn’t take you seriously.I hate to say it, but if the domain owner falls into this category, set your expectations low. Multi-million (or billion) dollar companies are notorious for wanting obscenely high prices for domain names.I can still remember one particular negotiation that I was a part of years ago. The startup founder had $750,000 for a domain that was clearly worth something in the $500,000 — $750,000 range. The domain was owned by a large company and I was able to get in touch with the decision-maker within the company. To show that we were serious, we started with a $350,000 offer. They countered at $7M and told me there wasn’t a chance they would go a penny lower. Doh!You probably aren’t going to be able to negotiate with a large company on your own. This is where domain brokers can be incredibly helpful. Domain brokers have a lot of experience negotiating with large companies. Just know that you probably aren’t going to get a broker to help you buy a domain name for $5,000 — $10,000 and a big company probably isn’t going to even consider offers in this low of a range.Be prepared to pay between 10% — 20% to the broker for closing the deal, but know that you’ll likely save a lot of money (and the deal can actually happen) if you find a domain broker that has worked with the company you are trying to buy from before.After reading this you will know enough to be dangerous. Still there are a lot of other resources out there to learn from on how to buy a domain name. My top recommendation for anyone who really wants to get an inside edge in this process is to attend a domain name conference.The next conference coming up is The Domain Conference (Even if the owner isn’t at the conference, the experts that are at the conference can give you incredible advice and it is very likely that someone there will know the person or company who owns the domain and can lend a hand.If you can’t make it to a conference I would recommend taking a look at a domain name forum. The three most popular forums are Last, but certainly not least, is read Domaining Blogs — you can find all the top domain bloggers on No matter what path you take, hopefully this article helps to take the guesswork out of buying domain names. —Like this article?

Last weekend, Danielle Morrill, CEO of Mattermark, Though nearly invisible to startups, LPs are higher up the money chain than VCs, and their concerns dictate how venture investing is done. If you’re seeking early-stage or first-time investment — or if you like to complain about VC attitude, which is common among frustrated entrepreneurs — you should understand LPs, because they play a bigger role in the venture stack than most startups realize.Here’s how it works. Contrary to popular imagination, venture capitalist aren’t just rich people who invest their own money. Instead, VCs, who may or may not themselves be rich, invest primarily The LPs who represent institutional funds typically put a very small percentage of the money they manage into venture capital funds, and they expect that percentage to be among Entrepreneurs like to Think of it like this: VCs report to another group of people. Those people care deeply about big returns, they are conservative spenders who like familiar patterns, they hold regular meetings with VCs to learn how their investments are faring, and their relationships can run for many years. If a VC wants to keep raising funds in the future, they have to keep their LPs happy — often for years before their investments start to pay off, which means making investments that the LPs can get behind.Entrepreneurs understandably get upset when VCs don’t grasp your business’s potential or tell you your idea is too complex. While those things happen, and they’re shitty, it’s not just that VCs are under-informed. It’s also that their LPs won’t support investments It’s well documented that women of all races and black, Latino and Native American men If you are seeking venture investment, you should understand all of this. Not only whether your company can become a rocket ship, which we all want to believe, but also whether you can submit to a grow-at-all costs approach and to taking on additional investment, which involves giving away more of your company. And, if you’re part of an under-represented demographic, know that your company’s story will have to be particularly clear and strong. (It’s also a good idea to understand all of this when you want to complain about VCs; makes your arguments smarter.)OK, so what if you aren’t sure whether you can grow super-fast, or whether you want to? Good news: VCs aren’t the only game in town. In fact, there are a growing range of options, many of which can be more attractive than venture capital, depending on your company and your disposition (boot strapping, crowd funding, good old revenue, etc.). This gets covered a lot, so I’m going to take a pass on re-writing the wheel. But I will note that if you’re seeking early-stage investment, you should understand Once you know the game VCs are playing, you can make a good decision about whether to engage.

If you like startups and you’re active on Twitter, chances are you’ve heard of (and love) We caught up with SLJ recently to ask a few questions of our own leading up to the LIVE Chat. The world may still not know the true identity of the person behind the Twitter handle, but we now know a little bit more about him/her. Read (and listen) on for more of the conversation.Those are always awesome because I get compared to some amazingly smart people. I’m very flattered. I don’t think people are making good guesses. It’s awesome to see what people are coming out with. I’m not Ben Horowitz; I love Ben Horowitz, I wish I was Ben Horowitz. That would be about the coolest thing in the world because that guy’s blog is amazing, and that guy is so smart. I’m not Hunter Walk, not Dustin Curtis. Keep guessing. :-)It’s one of those things that’s inevitable at this point. Early on, it was kind of an open joke. The company I was with at the time…a lot of people there know [it’s me]. So it’s actually not a well-kept secret, it’s just that no one who works at TechCrunch knows. I’ve always found it funny. To me, it’s a commentary on the state of tech journalism. I’m pretty sure if someone took a week and said, “I’m going to figure this out,” they could.I would say it’s on the order of probably a couple dozen [people]. It’s not a tightly held secret. But, it’s more fun now to have it be secret than have it be out.That’s not what I set out to do. I just set out to have fun. It was entertaining — I laughed I have [been asked for] both of those things. I’ll tell you one story without naming names. I was talking about certain aspects of platform strategy, and had a founder of a multi-billion dollar company DM me and say, “Hey, do you want to grab beers? I’m thinking about this problem.” So I met up with the dude. We talked about startups, and what he was trying to do, and some of the platforms I’ve worked on in the past. I don’t know if it was useful for him, but it was entertaining for me.Invest in shit that isn’t stupid. Go find good startups, go find people building good shit, and good things will happen. Simple thesis [laughs]. All the investors out there are like, “I’ve got Gmail for my email, and I have to give a shout out to There’s this concept of presentation of self. People present themselves differently in different contexts. You’re going to want to be different people online. You’re going to want to interact in different ways with different communities.I think that’s something Facebook understands really well. Zuck is the man — he gets it. He’s not [thinking there is] one platform to rule them all. He’s trying to figure out how to serve all the needs of people to connect in different ways, at different times, with different kinds of people. For what it’s worth, I’m long on Facebook because I think they actually really get how to build a constellation of different apps that serve these different needs. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see them buy whoever the winner is in anonymous apps, because they see that as a legitimate [communication] use case.That’s the thing that keeps it entertaining. Here’s this identity that’s obviously fake — I am not a cartoon black man. You just put these ideas into the world, and people have to take those ideas for what they are. It’s not that there’s a specific agenda there. It’s not like I have this ax I’m trying to grind. If you closely read every tweet, there are some things in there that are inconsistent with one another.Sometimes it’s just putting an idea in the world, and seeing how people respond to it. That’s just a fascinating experiment — seeing what people say, what they like, what they don’t like. I’ve learned a lot about social products, and virality, and what kinds of messages resonate with people. There’s no specific message — I hope [SLJ] is good for the world, and good for startups. I hope it gets people to think. I try not to be mean, because I don’t want to see bullies in the world.You want to talk about what’s rotting Silicon Valley? Let’s start with diversity. If you look at the demographics of the country or the world, and you look at the demographics of Silicon Valley, they are very different. So you can basically conclude one of two things: either the people who aren’t whiter and more dudely don’t have as much merit, I’m really appreciative of people out there who are doing things [about equality]. People like Ben Horowitz, Dave McClure, Mitch Kapor — Mitch is a badass motherfucker. He’s over there in Oakland doing such great stuff. He’s not out there talking about how great he is, but we should be. If you’ve got a startup and you need some interns, you should go over to Mitch and say, “Hey, bring me some of these kids who are from the streets of Oakland and know how to hustle.” If you want good marketing people — if you want a good ground game — go get some of those kids and put them in your startup.That’s diversity. What’s next?The two big issues I really care about are diversity and gender equality. I’m a big fan of what Sheryl Sandberg is doing. I work with a lot of female founders; I really try go out of my way to give female founders time because I think they do have a harder time of it. I see it in the interactions. The other day, someone said, “It’s hard to hire female marketing people because it’s been a dude’s game traditionally, so there are only junior female marketers.” That’s such a bullshit thing to say. If you don’t have them on your team, that’s because you haven’t prioritized it. Go find those great people, because they’re out there. We just need to stop making excuses, and we need to fix these problems on our own teams [first]. That will effect the way other [companies] do business.Culture is a hard ship to turn. If you get to 20 people, and 18 are white dudes, you’re going to have some problems. That’s cultural debt. You need to be thinking about that early, because the first 10 people you hire, and the way you interact with one another, is going to shape your company as it grows and gets outside of your control. The decisions you make [early] will be coming back at you for the next 10 years.The best new products, every day.

It’s no secret that investors don’t like hardware businesses. Despite the eternal frustration of startup founders, investor distaste in physical product businesses is actually entirely logical. It’s nearly impossible to build a venture-scale business by selling dumb plastic parts at a 30% gross margin.But the connected, vertically integrated hardware products of today are very different than their dumb counterparts of yesterday. The difference is simple yet profound: it enables hardware businesses to operate with financials that mimic their SaaS brethren. Somewhat surprisingly, the most notable example of this type of business model was pioneered by Keurig, a company few people think of as a hardware business. At Bolt, we believe this is one of the pillar business models of the next generation of hardware businesses, which is why our The core Keurig system is quite simple: a machine (the brewer) and a proprietary system for packaging single-serve coffee (K-Cups). Like many great hardware inventions, the original Keurig machine was invented in a dorm room and grew slowly. The two founders built prototypes but struggled to gain mass-market adoption until 1996 when Green Mountain Coffee made a large strategic investment in Keurig. With a stroke of brilliance, they later acquired Keurig as a way to efficiently distribute higher margin coffee.Keurig is one of most successful hardware companies of the past few decades. Except they’re not a hardware company. The vast majority of their revenue comes from coffee. In fact, 228M pounds of coffee per year, or more than 1.25 pounds for every coffee drinking adult in the US. Of the $4.7B in revenue in 2014, only $580M was from hardware sales. When discussing Keurig, nearly every single person will inevitably bring up the famed “razors and blades” business model pioneered by Gillette. The general gist is: sell a cheap “freebie” product (a razor) that requires continuous and high-margin replenishment to function (the blades). This is why a razor with a blade costs $7 but each blade after that costs $4 and why an inkjet printer costs $60 but each set of ink costs $40 or more.Nearly everyone buying “replacements” has a negative association with these purchases. Think of your emotion the last time you purchased a set of ink cartridges. Unless you have a weird obsession with ink, I’ll bet it was a feeling of frustration and being ripped off. I imagine a used car salesmen with slicked-back hair trying to convince me I should buy two sets “just in case I run out.” Yuck.Keurig on the other hand is always a positive buying experience. This primarily comes from the simple fact that you’re not buying replacements, you’re buying the thing you actually want to consume; the brewer is just a mechanism for delivery.Some might think there’s a fine line between Keurig-like business models and razor-like business models. Here are a few examples to test the boundary:When you open the box for a Kindle, you’re excited to own a new piece of technology. But the real magic of the product experience comes when you purchase and read your first book. The device melts away from the experience and becomes an invisible facilitator for the act of reading.The Brita water filtration system starts off as a complete product, but over time the filter wears out requiring you to replace it in order to get back to peak performance. Buying replacement filters, which are nearly half the cost of a full Brita system, feels like a nuisance.Like the Kindle, game consoles aren’t very useful on their own. This is completely acceptable to consumers as the entire psychological experience of using a game console hinges on the games themselves, rather than the delivery system (the console).A curious pattern emerges when looking at the handful of products on the market that follow these two business models. The relative cost of Keurig-like consumables to Keurig machines is much lower than the cost of razor blades to razors.In addition to the focus of the product (as discussed above), the price difference drives the negative psychological associations consumers have with razors-and-blades business models.So who really cares? Plenty of companies have built big businesses by selling hardware at a 30% gross margin. Why can’t you just run a Kickstarter and sell a ton of units through Best Buy when to scale up? You can, you’re just entering into a game of diminishing returns with an extremely slim chance of winning in the long-run (Recurring revenue matters because it fundamentally changes your business. There are good reasons investors are averse to hardware but love software. One of the leading reasons revolves around future revenue. Investors pay huge premiums to own stock in companies betting on the likelihood that future revenue will be drastically larger than current revenue. If you’re in a traditional hardware business, future revenue is confined to cyclic product sales. This roughly means you get one shot at revenue with each customer per product development cycle: each sale must be painfully acquired by building a new product every 18 months or so.Customer acquisition costs are often lower in hardware than in many SaaS businesses. This fundamentally comes from the psychological comfort we humans have from spending money on hardware ($120 for a coffee machine without thinking to hard) vs software ($120 for SaaS products is a difficult decision that very few average consumers make). For the inevitable customer acquisition cost that businesses do wind up paying, hardware companies recover that cost very quickly (usually in a few months at the point of sale) vs SaaS businesses (usually a year or more amortized over the usage of the product/service). This is where the brilliance of the Keurig model shines. The initial sale of a $120 Keurig brewer isn’t that difficult or costly. Keurig doesn’t spend a lot on marketing or advertising and the product isn’t complex to manufacture or service. In my rough estimation, the BOM for a brewer is around $40, giving Keurig about a 25% gross margin on the product. Time from PO to FOB is likely less than 2 months, yet high-margin K-cup sales start immediately and continue for years. Keurig spends less than $0.015 on each K-cup and charges 100% more per unit than bagged, ground coffee. Yet few people complain about this cost.There aren’t too many businesses that are built around this model, but there will be.In the past year, Bolt has made investments in Our bet is once these businesses are built, they’re next to impossible to dislodge and their customers become devoted to their products and consumables.Venture Capital Designed for Hardware.

My first startup failed. As a founder, and especially as the CEO, that was a tough pill to swallow. Because, at the end of the day, it was my responsibility to steer the ship.This article is meant to be the final page of my Critica chapter. But more importantly, I want to share the biggest lessons I learned coming out of it all, so that other entrepreneurs can strive where I stumbled.My two cofounders and I wanted to change the way we interact on websites. We pictured annotated websites, with lively debates happening everywhere, and related websites all connected to each other on one platform — Critica. We built a Chrome browser extension that allowed anyone to share their opinion on any website.Just by seeing our demo on the White House’s website, which does not allow public comments, got us and many others excited. We could democratize the entire Web, giving anyone the power to share their voice anywhere online.We quit our jobs, lived off our savings, worked out of You’ll hear the phrase “But if you should find yourself in that situation, remember that others have been there before you. They have bounced back, and so can you.An email I received from a friend who had a failed startup:To hear a fellow entrepreneur say those words was the helping hand that I needed to finally slap me out of my misery.We were all first-time founders at Critica, and pretty much just out of college. And most first-time entrepreneurs don’t listen to advice very well (especially first-time CEOs — I know I didn’t). The trait that makes you believe that you can be the statistical anomaly is actually the same trait that gives you blinders when you are in the startup trenches for the first time. You think that you know it all. After all, you’re already successful in your mind, so who cares what others have to say? Pay attention to the people who have been in the trenches before you. Not all advice is created equal, and knowing which advice to take is very hard. But even though they may not necessarily be right, you should at least consider their advice. They are trying to prevent you from falling where they have fallen before. Since my startup failed, I have returned to my mentors, to let them know how much I appreciated their advice, and how much I wish I had listened to them earlier.Annotating the web is not a new concept. This idea has been tried going as far back as the early 90s — back when the three of us were enjoying our nap time in kindergarten. I didn’t dive deep and learn from others who have tried and failed at executing the idea. There were definitely key learnings that I picked up along the way, after we had already built the product. I could have easily learned the same things before we wrote even a single line of code. And that would have vastly changed our focus, and saved us a lot of time.At v1, you already have a product that people are using. Your problem is growth. You can do user research on your existing users to figure out which new features you can build to get traction.At v0, you have no users. Reid Hoffman says this My biggest mistake was believing that we were in the v1 paradigm, when we were always in v0. We spent months and thousands of lines of code building out feature after feature of a product that had no users — the “The ‘Zombie Award’ is given to the team at Boost that always seemed to be working in the office. Critica received that award, and I can tell you that it was well-deserved.I remember the daze of the 16–20 hour days, 7 days a week. The chugging of Red Bulls, coffee and soda to stay awake. Saying goodnight to someone only to greet them in the morning from the same spot they left us in.It was a bit insane looking back. But I believed that the bags under my eyes were the mark of a real entrepreneur. I felt that if I wasn’t falling asleep at my desk, I was not working hard enough to be playing with the big boys in startup land. And while that perception is definitely out there, it is 100% wrong. If you’re focusing all your time on the wrong things, you end up going nowhere, burning out.I have the Zombie award on my desk now. It’s a stark reminder that the more hours you work, doesn’t necessarily correlate to a successful outcome. Most startups fail for one of two reasons. They run out of money, or they have some sort of founder breakup. Often times, the first leads to the second.There’s this perception that people are just handing out wads of cash here in Silicon Valley. That is not true. If you are all first-time founders just out of college, you are an unproven team. Which means that you need significant user traction to prove to investors that you have a company worth investing in. We did not have that traction. And so we ran out of money. My cofounders and I couldn’t pay our bills.Here’s what my personal bank account looked like at the end…Going into the negative was definitely a first for me. I hope to never be at that point again. But even if I should have to, it’s not so bad. Many people are afraid of the financial risk of building a startup. That risk is clearly a real thing, but even if you should experience hitting that financial bottom, the world won’t end. To my two cofounders, Alex and Bryan. We were college buds long before we started a company, and after what we just went through together, I know that we will be friends for many years to come.I’m honored that you both had the faith in me to forego large Bay Area engineer salaries and be with me day-in and day-out. When you’re in the trenches, the soldiers to your right and left are the people that keep you going forward. And you guys kept me going.To our investors at Boost VC— To the countless entrepreneurs and mentors who took the time to give us advice and help, thank you. Paying it forward is a real ethos in the tech world; it’s built into the fabric of Silicon Valley, and we experienced that first-hand.To our early users (the very few of you), thanks for taking a chance and bearing with us as we tried to figure things out on the fly.To my friends and family, thanks for all your support and understanding while I chased the dream. I know it seemed as if I fell off the face of the Earth for the last year and a half. I’m back now — a little battered and bruised — but back nonetheless.A founder sent me the following poem after I told him about Critica’s failure. It really helped me to bounce back. This is now posted at my desk, right next to the Zombie award. To the entrepreneurs out there — remember these words.It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.— Theodore RooseveltSo now it’s time for our next adventures. Alex and I are lucky enough to get to keep working together. We are now at a I’ll be in the startup trenches as a founder again. I just don’t know when that will be. What I do know is that I won’t make the same mistakes the next time around. The startup game is all about learning until you get it right. After all, you only have to be right once.

One of the first steps to launching a successful startup is building your However, most entrepreneurs don’t think too much about about the People lie to themselves in order to make sure that we can hear what we want to hear. But, when verifying whether an idea is a good fit to be a venture, I’ve found that there are some clearly flawed approaches, some approaches are situationally pragmatic, and some that are almost always ideal if you have the skills and resources to do so. Regardless there seems to be one big pattern: The hierarchy of the ways you can validate ideas through MVP’s (and other strategies) can be categorized as: Flawed, Situational, and Ideal. Below are a few examples in each:We now know the “build it and they will come” philosophy is not a good way to live by. It’s a good way to die by. The idea of “building something people want” is one to listen to. The engineers in the room that aren’t familiar with the lean startup movement will often go after this approach and tell you “you just don’t understand.”This also gives you an amazing opportunity to go and interact with a market and become an expert of their pains and frustrations — which is the best indicator of what they might be willing to pay for.If you consider yourself the CEO type, you may continuously be chasing ‘the next big thing” and find yourself with 3 or 4 attempts to make something, but never end up following through because you’re distracted by the next big problem you discovered.It’s also important to focus on whether people will This means building a product for whatever problem it is that you discovered (NO ‘ideas’) due to your experiences/expertise. The problem with this is that ego usually gets in the way, and you build the solution that you want to see, not necessarily what thousand of others want. Most of the time, this is a pretty dangerous approach in the sense that it encourages founders to continue to build something without constant feedback. That being said, if you can get customers interacting with a product quickly and you’re making changes based on their feedback, you’re on a strong track.There are some types of markets that this works well in — Pebble is the arguable the best example of this approach If you’re a technical founder then this is what you should be doing (most likely). The key with this approach is getting a good understanding of what a problem people in your market have and build a product that focuses on getting on your early adopters to pay you. It’s a challenge (though an important one) to find the balance between working product versus what is a desirable product.Immediately after, they started renting their movie collection to their friends, and Netflix was born. This might seem obvious, but if you ask most entrepreneurs how they would start their own Netflix today, you would get a very detailed, and technical answer. Start doing things by hand until you can’t scale any larger. This approach builds up the knowledge and expertise through selling something that they know there is a pre-established, and strong market for the desired industry at hand. Through that, an entrepreneur builds an audience, and if they -A healthy mix of nerd, sexy, coffee, and ambition.

This is a story about what happens when bullies grow up. The same kids that used to tease us for our love of gadgets, push us into lockers, glue “Kick Me” signs on our backs. Those kids grow up. They don’t stop bullying. They just keep taking and exploiting.The problem for them is: we are the powerful ones now.It started innocently enough. An old friend posted an open call on our local developer slack channel:“Anyone interested going to the Started Weekend [sic] as part of a ‘dream team’ of developers? Essentially, I’d like to join up with 2 or 3 other seasoned developers and we cherry pick whichever random startup that appeals to us that weekend. (I’m also working on a odd never-used-before legal document I’m calling a ‘Speculative Stock Warrant’. It is a ways to get a small kick-back if startup goes big 10 years later.)”Some of us expressed interest, and just like that it was done. The organizer dubbed us ‘Team Paladin’, a team of four battle-tested veterans. Our plan was set into motion. The team made arrangements to meet up and discuss the approach, the technology stack to use, etc. I live some distance away from the college town where the closest Startup Weekend is hosted, so I made plans to connect briefly on Day 1 of the event, a Friday. My little brother’s birthday. I would be sacrificing family time to go participate.I rolled into the restaurant and John was staring at the screen of his laptop, focused. He took a phone call with a lawyer friend while I waited, and when he hung up, he mentioned that they had been drafting copy for a contract that he intended to sign with the pitchman of whatever idea we adopted.I’ll be honest: I thought it was a huge longshot and wasn’t that concerned. All advice I read in the startup arena advises to be ready to sacrifice the next 5+ years of your life in the pursuit, and most tech startups have abysmal failure rates. Still, if John thought this was worth going after, sure, umbrella me under your ask: 0.4% each for our efforts over the weekend.We left and reconnected a couple hours later at the event venue. When I got there I was introduced to the third and fourth members of Team Paladin: Brad and Jason. I recognized them from posts from Twitter, and from the Google Group of the local makerspace. I knew we were going to work pretty well together.While I was sitting waiting for the pitches to commence, a gentleman made his way into the seat next to me and began making small talk. The guy introduced himself as Billy, and asked if I was pitching. I wasn’t, he was — but he didn’t want to spoil the concept. Nearly two hundred people had filled out the main room, and the master of ceremonies kicked off the event.An (extremely) energetic and funny Startup Weekend coordinator had some brief and encouraging words to say. “Pay attention to what your team can accomplish this week, and then take that energy and keep going!” “You can do it!”She took a second to make a specific point about the value of ideas. “Ideas? Let me tell you something. Everyone has an idea. They don’t mean anything. What matters is execution. Find a team here this weekend that has the skills to help you execute.”These are generally wise words that quickly become obvious to anyone that has launched into a tech startup before. Some ideas do matter. The Manhattan Project was a pretty valuable idea. PageRank was a very valuable idea. This was not one of those ideas.After hanging a poster board with a poorly illustrated He explained “StartupCo.com will allow restaurants to direct applicants to a website to submit their application/resume online to be sorted later.”“Ok, sounds good. He wants to solve his own problem. There are no customer interviews to do here outside of the team. I know there are already applicant tracking systems, but maybe not for this vertical. Would restaurants have their own specific needs that other ATS don’t fill? If he says he would pay for this, there must be others like him.”, I thought.Others thought so too. After listening to a few other ideas get pitched (a bluetooth-enabled doggie fence, an online shop for eSports merchandise, an app connecting tenants and landlords), everyone left to vote for their favorite ideas and assemble into teams. Team Paladin reconvened and most of us had floated the StartupCo idea to the top of our shortlist. So Brad broke off to go bring Billy back and propose the idea of us all working together.Billy brought along four other developer/designers he was already chatting with: Josh, Clay, Hayden, and another John.Our John, Team Paladin John, then went on to introduce ourselves and his idea for us to take 0.4% after helping launch the startup this weekend. That way should anyone go forward with the work product and it become a big success, at least there’s some kickback if this thing goes nuclear unicorn.It was a bit awkward then, because it was unclear if the other guys would want to umbrella under similar terms, and who would be interested in continuing a concept forward if we felt productive after the weekend.John explained that he’d spoken with Startup Weekend organizers and was told that contracts aren’t allowed from the event, so he asked for a handshake deal. Billy said he was happy with a handshake deal, and quickly moved the conversation forward without any handshaking actually taking place.“Do you think we can actually build the whole site in a weekend?”, he asked us.It didn’t cause any hesitation. The devs all looked at each other, quickly and simply responding “No.”“But.. You know, I mean, enough to show good progress.”And with that, and without much other option, that sealed it. Let’s do it! So we all hunted and quickly found a place to start working.It’s a common problem, I call it the Tower of Babel problem. It’s what happens when you take a sample of random developers and throw them together. We all have different experiences, different preferred technologies. What platforms/frameworks will we use? Do we speak any common languages? The lowest common denominator.It was about to be PHP. We settled on Python.Here’s how that feels as a developer. It’s not a bad language, it’s just not MY language. It’s like being a guest to a dinner party. I have a ton of experience eating. I’m actually good at it now, I haven’t choked on food in years. It’s just, well, where do you keep the plates? Where’s the silverware?We worked. Hard and fast. We split into working groups. Frontend, backend, and bizdev. Many of us in the group could have operated up and down the stack or on the business. One of our team started a company from his house and grew to almost 200 employees.My group, we tackled the backend starting with the database modeling. One-to-one or one-to-many? Will resumes be referenced to a candidate or a candidate’s specific application? Do companies have multiple locations?During our whiteboarding of this Entity-Relationship Diagram, Billy came in the room. ““Who’s that?”, someone responded. Curious.“My best friend, we’d been talking about this idea for months and he’s sick he’s not here. He’s wondering if he should come up.”Curiouser and curiouser.“Tell him to drive up! That’s only a 10 hour drive or so right?”, someone said. Much too early to be getting spooked. We have nothing yet.“Yea, maybe.. We’ll see.”, Billy replied, and left towards the frontend breakout room.Fast forward about five hours. It’s 3am and Billy must be snoring right now. John, J Michael, and I remain. But we’re fading fast and we recognize we’ll be more effective after a recharge.Everyone was working hard. Even Billy. I hadn’t heard the calls (he always left the room), but ever so often we would get a report from sales/bizdev: “Good news, guys! I just got off the phone with Addison’s. They’re onboard.” or “A regional manager at Aldi’s wants this, he said if it works he’ll run it up the chain! What if we landed the whole account!?”“What do you think about the navigation items, Billy? Should we leave the about page up there? Maybe put photos of the team?”, somebody said.“Woah, Billy, man it’s 2015 and I don’t think you can say that now.”, I said.Awkward silence. Some tapping on keyboards. We all wish that didn’t just happen but it did. Please apologize. Will you please?“Yea you can! yea you can, it’s not a big — ”, Billy trails off. We’re cringing. No backup for Billy, but somebody throws a life raft. Starts another technical thread. Did that just happen? Yes. Ugh.This would have made a nice photo for the “Hey, Billy”, I lead in, jokingly. “When they hand you the first place prize, make sure you find a way to throw us all under the bus and take full credit.”Laughs.“Haha, yea. I’ll say, ‘Some laughs. But nervous laughter.You know those jokes where you’re sort of joking but sort of not? You know that bully that dresses you down and then when you start to complain, it’s just — You know that guy that squeezes your hand just a little too hard in a handshake? Why do they do that?Why did he say that? Pass that off as a joke, but deep down I know he kind of means that.We are the nerds. We are important. We are not fungible.We built this internet.We are not second class to you because you dress in a button-down and joined the right frat. Work out at the right gym. Send your kids to the right private school. Interned for the right consulting firm. Got born into the right money.Actually, we are in charge now. You just haven’t realized it yet. I’m not going in. I’m not going to help this guy win when he treats people that way.I was just going to spend the rest of the day with family and then make the long drive home. But then John texted me.Maybe I owe it to the rest of the guys. Judging is half a day away anyway. Just show up at least.I couldn’t help myself though, and spent the rest of the afternoon trying to convince Flask to store uploaded profile images into SQLAlchemy LargeBinary columns.Very impressive. A lot of teams much smaller than ours pulled off some amazing stuff. One startup even gathered $250K worth of LOIs.Billy made it a point early in the day to charm somebody into letting him present last. “You want to be fresh in the judges’ minds,” was the advice.We all lined up as Billy took the microphone in one hand, and read from his script in the other.Or maybe it was just an outline. Because not 20 seconds into the delivery he’s already stumbling on the word “process” and needed prompting from the audience.If you forgot what Billy looked like, you’ll always remember after sitting through our presentation. That’s because Billy’s face is on most of the slides. I wish I was kidding.I’ll cut to the chase. And that’s fine. It wasn’t shocking that somebody needed to be receptive to press, to hold the prize packet, and to be the name and face for an easy story. Well maybe that’s not fine, but that’s not the major issue.What happens next is the issue.The afterparty after a Startup Weekend is pushed out about a week after the night of the judging. That’s because there’s only one winning team and everybody else is exhausted and disappointed.If I’m Billy, I’m probably ripping open the packet in front of the team. Probably I’m even inviting everybody back to the bar at my restaurant to celebrate. What I’m not doing is letting my team just hover around me while I field the press interviews. But, I’m not Billy.Billy didn’t thank or congratulate the team that night. He didn’t call, say anything on our slack channel, or even send an email the next day. He wasn’t in his restaurant when I walked in to chat with him. He wasn’t there. I left my phone number but Billy didn’t feel like talking.I started to worry a little.Then I just started complaining loudly. Finally he popped into chat.Billy had a busy day, and it turns out his buddy JP did too, because that day he became owner/operator of StartupCo!In fact, Billy decided not to address the entire team through email until So this is where my narrative ends. This is where the copypasta starts. The words speak for themselves.I feel disgusted.I know it’s uncomfortable, I do. I know it’s much easier to shrug it off and keep the peace. But we can’t do that.When guys like Billy win, we all lose. Please, stop letting guys like Billy win.[It’s at this point some of the other guys privately agreed with me on slack..][now back to Billy.]Founder

In the last year I have had the privilege of going through both Y Combinator’s and 500 Startups’ accelerator programs — the veritable bootcamps for a generation of young and hungry entrepreneurs. While a huge amount has been written about YC, even from a few super cool friends (From 10,000 feet, the two look quite similar: both are investment funds that run accelerator programs where startup companies can apply to be part of a 3 month program, receive roughly $100,000 investment for 5–7% of their company and get access to a network of partners and alumni. This all culminates in a Demo Day — a pitch frenzy of their companies progress to date in a room full of vaguely-interested investors. However, there are some fundamental differences, especially in the qualities they value in companies and founders and the value they provide them. These differences reflect their individual ideologies, and help explain the types of companies that go through each — and hopefully what I’ve seen will provide some better context for those exploring either or both.I’ll start with 500 Startups as we did this program first, starting in January of 2014.The most valuable parts of 500 Startups If you’ve been anywhere close to a startup, San Francisco, or a news outlet that covers technology, you’ve heard of Y Combinator.The most valuable parts of YC If nothing else is clear from my above discussions of the two, though, would be the fact that YC and 500S are just different beasts. YC is elite. 500 is scrappy. Dave McClure would suggest 500S “500 Startups is a phenomenal place to enter silicon valley, learn the hard lessons of building a product, reaching users, and running a startup. They have incredible variance in the type of companies, founders backgrounds, and stages of companies in their programs, and they thrive on the diversity. This provides for an exciting network with a lot of breadth. They are making a big play on international companies and hammering away at tried and true business models. The support structure is core to their being, and the time you get to interface with partners and staff is unparalleled.YC is where savvy and incredibly bright individuals as well as companies that have already proven they are on an interesting trajectory go to rocketship their growth and visibility. They are making plays on the brightest and most capable people, and are visibly expanding the scope of types of companies they are interested in. They have breached new sectors such as Personally, I got more value as a person/founder from 500 Startups, but our company was undoubtedly better off for doing Y Combinator. 500 Startups helped me enter the founders mentality with stability and structure. Partners, alumni, and other batch mates were incredibly supportive of what we were working on, and people were constantly looking to help one another. They also created an environment where discussing mistakes and failures was an important and necessary part of the process. YC was the perfect place to take a just proven model and accelerate growth. As a founder I gained focus and was able to clearly set specific goals. The company was elevated in status and our ability to both hire and raise seed capital from awesome people improved dramatically. The communities of each are unbelievably strong and unique and I’m grateful to be a part of both.———If you are considering applying for an accelerator with your startup, I would recommend applying to both. They are the best in the Bay Area, and if you can get into one of them it will be invaluable for you and your company. If you want advice on either, the applications, or are somehow in the situation of considering doing both, feel free to hit me up at Co-Founder 

After the company I founded in Silicon Valley was acquired (and realizing I needed burnout recovery), I sold all my possessions and started traveling the world in a carry on backpack.Along the way I mentored over I’m thankful that I’ve seen first hand not only the spirit of entrepreneurship in every corner of the globe (even North Korea, of all places), but that meaningful change can and is being made through the advice in this post and the dedicated efforts of local community leaders. I hope this helps you in your efforts, wherever you are!Every place is different, but I found very common patterns in the basic advice these types of groups needed to hear. Below, I’ll outline anIt’s no mistake the top accelerators in the world are evolving this way. They need to do a better job bringing the right people in, and a better job getting financial returns from the winners.TechStars has Imagine you’re a football coach. If you coach a well-known team in a market where kids already want to play football and the best ones rise to the top, you can lean back and pick. But if you go introduce football into a new or underdeveloped market, you have to do a lot of community building, encouragement, talent identification and development, etc. just to have a shot at building a good program.Startup Weekend and the other UP Global services are just one of many examples of how to do this. I’ve been a host, sponsor, speaker, judge, mentor, and participant at Startup Weekends all over the world, from keynoting the largest SW ever in Shenzhen, China to explaining what “startups” are to rural Filipinos. It is very easy to identify in those 48 hours which people have potential, while simultaneously developing the community for long-term indirect benefits.YC, arguably the world’s top accelerator, has had lots of mega unicorn successes. But if they had more money at their disposal to continually double down on their winners, their returns could be record breaking.Which is There’s something in entrepreneurship I call the Lemonade Stand Syndrome. It’s when someone with authority (the “adult”) really wants to foster entrepreneurial passion, so they encourage the “kids” to try a lemonade stand. But they’re afraid to give real feedback to the aspiring entrepreneur and thus turn them off, so they say “Yum, this lemonade is really good! Here’s a nickel!” instead of telling them their lemonade sucks and they’d rather buy from their neighbor’s kid who uses savvy social media for customer acquisition and organic gluten-free free-trade lemon powder. (It also reflects the very real ageism in Silicon Valley, but that’s for another post.)A common example of this is collegiate startup competitions where inevitably someone pitches an analog t-shirt company but wants to raise venture capital — and no one tells the founder the truth, which does more harm to the founder than the possibility of “turning them off” to this life.Because of Lemonade Stand Syndrome, the Signaling Problem, and other politics, many accelerators are afraid to give blunt merit-based feedback or take actions that publicly treat their children differently.But who cares? Everyone knows some startups win and most lose. Demo Day is literally an audience of people judging the output of your companies. Why should you hide this reality from your founders? The market, press, customers, employees, and investors are all cut throat capitalists. Competition is reality. Universities grade students. An average “C” student at Harvard is still pretty damn smart, but when they’re competing for that job at McKinsey, what matters is where they rank among their peers. Plus it gives them a kick in the ass — something many first-time founders in accelerators need.If I have 10 seed companies, and I believe 3 of them are on track to be winners, then I obviously believe the other 7 aren’t going to get there. No one has a crystal ball and some of those 7 companies might win. But the reward for going heavy on your 3 likely winners outweighs the downside of A compromise is to have some kind of clear standard that you communicate to your companies, and possibly the outside world. It could be quantitative things like validated market size or attracting above $X of outside capital, or qualitative things like “we give you a weekly score on how well you’re doing the Lean method. If you end with an 8 out of 10 or above, we fund you.”Far too often I see startup judges (either as a formal judge or via deciding to fund or support a company) try to judge the startup within their own worldview. Like when a company wins a hackathon because they made an app for children, and the judge happens to have children who like that stuff. Meanwhile, the team that improved solar panel efficiency by 20% is demoralized because the judge doesn’t like the sun and didn’t vote for them.Judging pre-product-market-fit startups There should be uniqueness from one accelerator to another. But at their core, the most successful accelerators in the world have six job functions:That sounds obvious, yet most get it wrong. Your job as an accelerator, everything you do, is to end up with financial stakes in successful companies.If you’re a government, school, etc you have essentially the same mission — to see lots of big successful ventures making everyone rich, which in turn fuels the circle of life. You just attack it from a different angle.Outside of San Francisco this means you need to develop the community so you can attract talent, combined with going and finding talent, so you can teach them how to be better companies, and then help them win.So it’s OK to have accelerators around inherently specialized verticals, like medicine or space, but to have a “Web” batch and a “Mobile” batch is silly.Throw events, like I like events that share authentic stories from people who’ve walked the path. Or events (Hackathons are great if you’re actually building stuff and Preferably, do this for free or at-cost. Obviously, branding is a big part of this. Can people find you? How is your “entrepreneurship SEO”? You want to be the group that has Some of those functions have “greater good” effects, so why should the accelerator pay for all the costs when society gets some of the benefit? Pitch the government and get public backing — money, tax breaks, matching funds, free or cheap venues, fast tracked visas, a ‘concierge’ to help founders deal with navigating bureaucracy, free broadband, free plane tickets, etc.For example, the French and Dutch government own pieces of Air France KLM, so they provide free plane tickets to accelerators bringing in overseas mentors! The key here is to give transparency in your relationship with government, but not control over how you operate. They’ll just muck it up. Try and put on paper that this is a long horizon — I’ve seen politicians pull the plug on things after two years because they don’t understand This is one of the biggest gaping holes in current accelerators. Even the New York Yankees have scouts that go out and find talent and a minor league team with specialized coaches and psychologists to develop that talent. You should too.Go find the PhDs tinkering in universities. Go find a successful offline company that should be going online (I found an entrepreneur stuck in Russia with an offline travel agency trying to do just that — Yes, it’s hard and takes more work, but shut up or get out. If I had to pick between farming and hunting, I would only hunt for my deal flow. But 99% of the time accelerators are doing mostly or only farming.I don’t care if you’ve told your investors / the government that you’ll fund 10 startups a quarter. If you only find four worthy ones, then only do four. If that’s really a problem, fix your farming and hunting and/or do a better job managing your investors.I’m usually against “decision by committee” accelerators. It can work in professional venture capital firms that require unanimous partner consent before deploying $10M. But for early stage, Remove the voodoo from the selection process. If you’re going to invite outsiders (like a local business person) to help you judge, they better be extremely relevant — don’t ever have someone who built a textile factory 20 years ago judge your next Instagram without clear guidance from you on how to judge the right way.Be flexible in your financial offers, rather than trying to shoehorn everyone into $50k for 8% or whatever. Y Combinator can do this, you can’t. You need flexibility especially if you’re going to go hunt for products that already have some traction, experienced founders, etc. Founders whining about getting a lower valuation than another startup? Tough, that’s business.The goal is to teach, not to whip startups into fundable / launchable shape in 90 days. Your goal is to graduate students that are equipped to do their job. The full-time leaders and part-time mentors have to be extremely intentional in how you plan and use your founder’s time. You are a “shit umbrella” charged with protecting them from wasting time. Assume every founder-hour is worth $1,000 in equity value. Don’t put them into too many meetings and events. Mentor well (more on this below).Too many accelerators have a schedule like “Week 1 is Lean Canvas. Week 2 is Venture Capital. Week 3 is Prototyping.” This might be fine if it was I’ve seen founders spend their first few weeks invalidating their original idea. OK, that’s good. But then an arbitrary date happened and the accelerator says “it’s time to start prototyping now if you want to be fundable by demo day!” So even though it had been We need more than just consumer / app software startups. Since most of the famous “Silicon Valley style” entrepreneurship in the last 10 years was in this pattern, that lead to the successful rise of things like Startup Weekend — where you literally could start and launch an app in a few days. But that framework is now doing us a disservice by being applied too broadly. It’s easy to put something simple, like an app, on a relatively patterned timeline. But if you want to invest in hardware, energy, enterprise, or Some things are happening throughout, like mentorship and progress meetings with accelerator leaders. Have a clear, predictable, and consistent weekly “structure” agenda, such as all hands meetings on Mondays, outside speaker and dinner on Tuesday evening, one-on-one meetings on Wednesday and Thursday morning, Show and Tells with drinks on Friday nights, etc. Don’t deviate and don’t put noise in the rest of the time.If you have any founders who feel lost the day after graduation, it is entirely your fault. What happens after graduation? Are you leasing space to companies? Doing follow on funding? Providing mentors? Be clear about it.How will you continue to provide support? Off the record Alumni Summits are awesome. Include all your founders in your mailings and events. Have a Founder email list (and even one Company winding down? Don’t give them shit. Help them do it gracefully, and if you think the people are talented and it was a “worthy failure”, get them into your other companies or have them try again in your next batch.You can also offer tactical support, if you can legitimately pull it off. Legal, HR, accounting, office admin, press relationships, recruiting, government relations, etc can all be helpful value-adds to startups.Entrepreneurship is an artisan craft. There is a reason why the #1 predictor of whether a person will be an entrepreneur is if their parent(s) were entrepreneurs — because this qualitative stuff is learned from example, handed down like an apprenticeship. The last 10 years have seen a ton of content put on the web (e.g. I learned about venture capital from investor bloggers before going on to raise $17M as one of the world’s youngest VC-backed founders), but so much of the best info is still handed down from person to person through chatting about case studies while drinking coffee.For example, at an accelerator in a nascent ecosystem in southern Europe, I spent almost all of my three days there undoing the harmful prescriptive advice given from other mentors. They meant well — after all, they donated their time to come in and help. But it did more harm than good.The relevance and authority of mentors is key. At this incubator, a successful corporate marketing executive was telling seed stage startups they needed to spend most of their accelerator investment cash on launch marketing. Just… no. Better to have no meeting at all than to waste time on that advice.Teach your founders to have I’ve run across a lot of “professional” mentors who did something mildly notable 20 years ago and they still do the speaking circuit as a way to seem relevant. Avoid these people.It’s simple: This chicken and the egg problem is a huge barrier in new markets. Every community leader I know outside of SF is starving for quality mentorship.Either do what you need to do to bring the right people in (fly them in, pay them, whatever), do what you need to do to take your companies to them, or don’t do it at all. Spending $500 or $1,000 on a qualified mentor is worth its weight in gold.Better yet, get someone else to pay for it. For example, the US State Department paid for an accelerator in Russia to fly me in as part of a goodwill “let’s not start another Cold War” program.For this reason, for the last year I was working with UP Global / Startup Weekend on a new project called Entrepreneurs Across Borders. It was meant to be a super easy matchmaking service between qualified mentors and the locations that needed them. For example, a legitimate founder from New York could get a free plane ticket and hotel in Athens for a week in exchange for two days of mentoring at the local incubator. I know many extremely helpful founders from places like SF would love to do this kind of subsidized travel, but it’s currently too laborious and ad hoc to be routine.Unfortunately UP Global didn’t have the resources to formally launch it and it’s now a zombie. Perhaps now as part of TechStars they will!EDIT November 2015: I ended up doing it — check out It’s your crucial duty to make sure the mentors you put in front of your startups are qualified. You should write down what you do and do not want from mentors. Don’t let them in front of your companies until they’ve read it or discussed it with you.Too many accelerators proudly boast of their huge number of mentors. I saw an accelerator give an update to their investors with a proud statement of “in the first four weeks, our startups have had over 300 hours of mentorship!” But the quality was awful. Talk about a You should differentiate between Mentors and Network. Have a big Network of people who you can turn to for reactive help as specific issues come up — lawyers, accountants, hardware OEM specialists, freelance press relations, etc. This is what most “mentors” listed on accelerator websites actually are today. But don’t put these people in the wrong situations, such as a lawyer giving product feedback (it happens surprisingly often). You can still list these people on your website as a marketing tool and as a ‘reward’ to those people for giving their name and time.But then have a smaller, curated group of Mentors. These are the people you’re proactively putting in front of your companies every week. If you have access to a Mentor with a clear track record (such as recently exiting a startup), then bring them right into the Mentor group and thank them for their time. Otherwise, people should start off in the Network group and earn their way up into the Mentor group.Founders should be grading every person they meet with, either Network or Mentor. Is a Mentor getting bad feedback? This works even better if you can compensate the Mentors via equity sharing. Companies give “advisory board” equity to their mentors, so why shouldn’t part of the accelerator equity go to Mentors? It’s worth it to give excellent Mentors 1% of the fund upside than to have free mediocre people.A common problem is a mentor standing in front of founders and saying “I did XYZ this one time and it failed, SO YOU SHOULD NEVER DO THAT!”Or even worse: “I did ABC this one time and my company succeeded, SO YOU SHOULD ONLY EVER DO THAT!”There is a reason why the #1 most given answer by qualified mentors to the common questions asked by startups is “it depends.” There are very few rules in startup land. Yet most mentorship is prescriptive and ignores this. Your job is to give founders accurate and relevant data points (both qualitative and quantitative), guidance on how they can answer their questions, specific resources for them to do so (like an introduction to an expert), and to hold them accountable for what they do.Some of my basic advice here is to just give appropriate context and teach frameworks, not prescriptions. “When I did XYZ, it didn’t work and ABC happened. But I’ve heard of XYZ working for this other company. I think the difference was 123. You should investigate these RTY specific questions to figure it out, and based on that, this is how I would personally navigate those forks in the road if I were in your shoes.”Asking the right questions can be better than directly answering what the startup wanted to know. For example, a very common question is “how do I raise money?” Most of the time my response is “Have you gone through the process to determine Even appropriate but incorrectly-timed questions can be damaging. Good mentors are experienced and naturally excited by this world, so we can accidentally get ahead of ourselves. For example, if talking with a new startup that is still trying to identify its customer cohorts, it’s not worth asking “so what technology stack are you going to use on your future mobile app?” It seems innocent, but it takes valuable time and can give the entrepreneur a false positive that they should be considering that now.You should also use your experience to dig into the things they might not have thought about, like motivations (“Do you want to be rich or in control?”) and models (“Is it more important that you build a business, or do you want to have positive social impact?”)Or maybe they need to be re-calibrated. Using the This helps you recognize and avoid your own human baggage. It’s amazing how often I see a startup go through mentorship with predictable results: the B2B mentor gave them advice to pivot towards B2B, the app guy told them to go mobile first, the VC told them to sell their soul for the sake of growth, the SaaS lady told them to value recurring revenue over anything else, and so on.Admit when you don’t know something. If your ego is so fragile that you have to bullshit your way through mentoring a startup when their entire life might be on the line, then you need to stop mentoring and seek help.It’s their startup, not yours.

A while ago we started a new ListHunt series that finds the best new tools for startups and founders from the past week.

Thought Leadership — Failing fast, where failing is 3 weeks worth of work (so you…gave up?) — Writing about creativity, tech and business. Contact: Accelerated Learning, Tech, Antifragility, and Definite Optimism

This past week I completed my first year at Pocket, a startup in San Francisco. Without further ado, here is what I have learned about working as a designer in a top-notch startup:I have worked in design consulting, large companies and startups. In large companies and agency a lot of the work we performed never saw the light of day. Whether because of politics, or a change in leadership or priority, what ends up happening is At a startup with a small team like Pocket we can’t afford that. The beauty of this effort in prioritization and efficiency is that every single design and research project I have worked on at Pocket has been implemented into the product or A/B tested.Our engineers know UX. Our designers know growth hacking. Our data analytics team knows product strategy. Our community managers know code. Our partnerships team knows design thinking. You get the point. We have really talented people who are not only great at what they do, but can contribute in other areas as well. This really helps in working across functions effectively and connecting the dots on the big challenges we are working on.On top of working well together, each person is a leader. When a person gets assigned a project the team expects that person to own that project wholeheartedly — to drive it, pursue it, look for support wherever she/he needs and arrive at a great solution at the end.Here’s the one thing that is true about every startup: No one really knows what will happen. No one knows what the next step will be. One day you are a darling, on the other However the best startups follow a process. To keep improving their product and service they work diligently through ideation, design, prototyping, validation and iteration. If you work at a startup that is phenomenal at this process you are constantly learning how to increase your chances of being really successful. Pocket kicks ass in this process. Having learned about Ok, so that is what I had to share today. It is late, so I will hop in bed and get ready for another fun year at Pocket.Cheers,D.If you found this helpful, please share and follow me on I am an inventor who tells stories through design.

In the fall of 2014, I’m on faculty as an Entrepreneur in Residence at Florida State University. I, like other professionals in the field, struggle with finding time to consume content. So created an event open to all Florida State University students where I screened the entire semester of “How to Start a Startup” in a single day from 7am-11:50pm, 16 hours straight.Below is a live commentary.Alright let’s do this!Helping startups is hands on and customized to a startup.30% is pretty standard and is what is taught in this course.Information in this course is geared towards hyper growth. Honestly who wouldn’t want hyper growth?Four determinants of startup success: Idea, Product, Team and Execution.1) IdeaLong term thinking is a huge advantage in startups. The best companies are almost always mission oriented. If you don’t love what you are doing, you’ll likely give up along the way. Good startups, take 10 years, not 2–3 years. Starting with a massive idea, inspires stakeholders and motivates work harder.The best idea usually looks terrible at the beginning. You want an idea that can turn into a monopoly. Great companies start by taking over one small market and growing quickly. Investors think about the growth of company, but also think about the growth of the market. Customers are usually desperate for a solution. You can’t force a market, thus it is important to conduct some research. Good startup ideas can be explained in a sentence. Any company is a clone with a small differentiator, usually fails.2) ProductBuild products, talk to users, eat, sleep, and nothing else. A founder’s goal is to build something that users love! It’s better to build something that a small number of users love, instead of something a large number of users like. If you make something people love, they will tell their friends about it. Over the long run, great products win! Start something simple.Talk to users, don’t use google ad words, just go talk to people around you. Get user manually and realize that the goal is to get a few users to love the product. You have to do sales and customer service yourself. Live on growth.Dustin Moskovitz — is now talking that being a founder is incredibly difficult, stressful, and requires 24 hour focus. Being a founder isn’t glamorous. Being a CEO, you aren’t the boss, everyone else is your boss.So why become an entrepreneur? The world needs it and you are passionate about the idea enough and are going to do it anyways!Choosing a founder who you aren’t friends with is just a bad idea. The track record for founders who don’t know each other is just not good. Solo founder is better than a random founder. Co-founders should be relentlessly resourceful, like James Bond. 2–3 co-founders is a right amount. Try not to hire, you are judged by the number of employees. It sucks to have employees, high burn rates, tension, slow decision making. The cost of getting an early hire wrong is incredibly high.It takes forever to find the best people. Founders consistently under-estimate how long it takes find someone as a co-founder or as a hire. Hiring should spend either 0% or 25% hiring. A mediocre hire will kill a startup. The best source to find someone to hire, is your network. When you work for Facebook in the first 2–3 weeks, a HR basically forces you to reveal each smart person you know. Sam Altman’s three determinants of hiring: smart, get things done, do I want to spend time with them. Try to work on a project instead of conducting an interview. You want people who will just get stuff done. Mark Zuckerburg, hires people he will spend time with socially and also who he would feel comfortable reporting to.Provide early employees with large amounts of equity. The first 10 employees should receive 10% and they have to earn it over the first four years. Be as generous with equity to employees, and be as stingy as possible with investors. Retaining employees is incredibly important and difficult. Three things that provide an employee with pleasure and meaning: autonomy, mastery and purpose. Fire fast, its best for everyone. Fire people who are bad at their job, create office politics, and are persistently negative.Co-founder split should be near equal. If there is a non-equal split it is likely a reason to step back and think about this relationship. Vesting of four years is the industry norm, with a one year cliff.– ExecutionThe best way for a company to execute is for the founders to execute. Ideas are not worth much, execution is what matters. Execution has two components 1) figuring out what to do 2) getting this done.Focus matters, Sam Altman asks a founder how do you spend your time? What matters is spending time on the 2–3 most important items. It is impossible to do more, because of fires of the day. Say no a lot!!!Growth and momentum is what matters. Don’t get distracted by other issues.Intensity matters. Focus, move quick, work hard, focus on quality, be decisive. Every time you talk to the best founders, they’ve gotten new things done. Quick, do whatever it takes, show up, don’t give up. Good founders get on planes when they need to.Momentum and growth are the life blood of startups. Startups have to always keep winning. Always keep momentum, always keep growing. Don’t get distracted by other things. Sales fix everything. If momentum sags, there is disagreement among employees, the focus should be to talk to users, ask them what they want, and do that. Work on small things to create growth. Don’t worry about a competitor until they are beating you with their real product. A competitor’s press doesn’t. ‘The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers you at all, but just makes better products’ — Henry Ford.Starting a startup is counter-intuitive. But one’s intuition about people is usually spot on. Work with people you respect and likely working with, and you have known for a while. You don’t need to be an expert in startups to be a successful founder. What you need is expertise in your users. The best way to convince an investor to invest, is to demonstrate that a startup is growing. The way to create a startup that grows, is to create a product that users love. You are unable to game the system in startups. There is no boss to trick, there are only users. Users will only judge if they want and love. You can somewhat trick investors, for one or two rounds, if you know what you are talking about, but you are really tricking yourself because your equity is likely to ultimately be worth not much when your company fails. As a company grows, the total volume of worry and concern also grows.Learn how to unconsciously think about startup ideas, learn a lot about things that matter, work on ideas that interest you, and work with people you like and respect.Paul Graham states the business school teaches management. If you want to be an entrepreneur, he advises individuals to learn about product. The best way to learn about product is actually just to start a company.You will know a side project becomes a startup when it takes on an alarming amount of your time.Ok to the next lecture: Lame approach to startups: Build product in secret, exclusive press launch, wait for users, buy users, and give up…Become an expert, identify customer segments, and storyboard ideal user experience.To become an expert, become obsessed with your industry and competitors. Seriously read the nerdiest information relevant to your industry.Minimal Viable Product (MVP). Must be viable. Simplicity is key.First few users, should be you, your social network, friends, family, online and local communities, influencers, cold calls and emails, and press.Customer Feedback — have a way for customers to contact you, ideally a phone number with voice mail. Ultimately you should be getting out from behind your desk and talk with customers. Talking with a customer is not a laboratory, you should focus on getting to know the customer, take them out for drinks or coffee. For a paid product, the less a founder knows, the more honest the customer feedback. For a free product, this may not be true, for free products, where users who you don’t know might not care enough to give you honest feedback.When building a tech product, make features manual in the beginning that will be automated over time.Features can hide the root problem, to understand the root problem talk with customers. S is for stealth and stupid, just launch already…Viral growth experience is about an amazing 1) experience plus 2) referrals.To create a robust referral service 1) collect customer touch points (Have a growth plan when you start. What is an optimistic and realistic way to grow this business? Example: Week 1 get that first user. Week 2, 2 users. Early on it should be easy to reach these goals if you created a product that consumers love. If you are failing to grow for 3–4 weeks, you need to step back and consider a pivot. Anticipate uneven growth.Always want to aim to become a monopoly! You have to create value and capture the market. Airlines vs google. Airlines is a huge market but profit margin is so incredibly small compared to the profit margin of google.If you are in a perfectly competitive industry, you will tell a lie that the industry is less competitive. Non-monopolies will describe a super small industry, as a niche “We are the only british food restaurant in Palo Alto”. Does this intersection make sense? It is incredibly hard to make money in this situation.On the other side, the people who have monopolies, pretend they do not have a monopoly. Two lies, but there is actually massive differences in the market structure and value between these companies. Google has 66% market share but never describes it self as a search engine, but instead as an advertising company or a technology company. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple each have lots of cash 10–100b and huge gross margins.Start with a small market. If you think the market may be too big, it most certainly is. Most tech companies dominate one market and then expand. These companies often start with markets that many people think is too small. Think about Facebook market which consists of 10,000 students at Harvard, reached 60% penetration in a few months.You want to be the only company in a market who can lead. Larger markets equal more competitors.Characteristics: Propriety technology (Its not enough to have a monopoly for a day, you want to be a monopoly over time. You want to be the last mover, not the first. Most of the value of the value in a company exists far in the future. Whenever you do the math on a tech company, 85% of cash flow values are atleast 10 years out. Ask, why will this be a leading company 10–15 years out?The first one in a market rarely makes money. This connects back to the previous lecture that there is no reason to be in stealth mode with one’s startup. Launch, have a go at it, acquire customers, learn, and scale.Look at Tesla, what is impressive is that it looks like an old school monopoly, solving something incredibly complex. Compared to a software company, great product + fast adoption rate + capital efficient business can become a monopoly, e.g. airbnb.We find ourselves driven towards competition, if we see someone else doing something we want to do it. Competition is a form of validation. But its not that there is wisdom in crowds. The fact that there are so many people doing something, it may be a sign of insanity. Why fight when the stakes are so small? When its hard to differentiate yourself from others, you have to compete, on metrics that may be more imaginary than real.Remember it is important to reflect on what important for you.Retention is a main determinant of growth.Focus on active users in the last 30 days. This figure will show retention rates. If retention rate is not good, need to think hard about product market fit. Different verticals need different retention rates, e-commerce 20–30% of re-occurring users is completely successful, if this was a social networking site, this rate is awful. If you are a startup, the whole team is the growth team. The CEO needs to set the north star of where the company will go. Mark Zuckerburg focused on monthly active users, this is the north star he created. Airbnb is nights booked! Ebay is growth merchandise volume. Each company needs a different north star. This north star will guide company’s decisions, especially employees.At Facebook, focus is on helping a new user reach 10 friends in 14 days. The magic moment is when you sign up, have zero friends, and your friend’s face pops up. On ebay, the magic moment is when you find the old pez dispenser. Airbnb, the magic moment is when you find an incredible rental house, or when you host that you actually get paid. Finding this magic moment, is important because it has a significant positive impact on retention.To create growth, focus on the marginal user.At the bottom of each email with hotmail the tagline is “Sent by Hotmail”, low payload because each email’s payload was the recipient, frequency is high, and conversion high. Paypal offered free money with low payload and frequency with high conversion rate.SEO: human research, see what people are searching for thats related to your site, how many people are searching for this term, how valuable is this search, etc.Email: Dead for individuals under 25. Email, SMS, and Push all act the same and need to be delivered. After delivery it is about conversion. The most important email is a notification. Don’t treat a user who signed up yesterday as the same as a person who has been a user for years. What notifications should you be sending? How can you create great trigger marketing campaigns?Focus on emulating experiences from the real world, treat new users like you are dating, and treat current customers like you are married.Customer support occurs in each step in a customer conversion. Making everyone conduct customer support does two things: it creates the right incentives for everyone including designers and developers to understand and solve customer problems.Stanley Tang, Founder, DoorDashDoor Dash, launched in an hour with a landing page, pdf menus, and a phone number. Someone called and the founders delivered the order. At the beginning founders should focus on testing one’s idea and seeing if the product is something that consumers want.The founders of Door Dash created a technology company but everything was done manually by the founders, emails, delivery, google docs for orders. This facilitated maximum learning for the founders to become experts in the field. Scaling doesn’t matter in the beginning. Learn then scale.Test your hypothesis, launch fast, and do things that don’t scale.Doing things that don’t scale is an advantage! By don’t scale: doing things that are financially unsustainable, likely because they take way too much time.When you first launch, you are going to be bad at selling it, you don’t have success stories, you don’t know pain points. So it is your responsibility to spend personal time to acquire first customers. Think about pushing a giant rock, the beginning is the toughest! It is impossible to make money on early users, but don’t give away your product for free. Need to turn these first users into champions, through an amazing experience. Do this by talking with your users. You are never going to get a better sense of your company and product then by talking with your customers.Three ways to talk to customers: run customer service as long as possible, proactively reach out to current and churned customers, and social media/communities.Problems are inevitable, do whatever it takes to make them right. Product-market fit. Product to scale is unlikely the product that you launch. Focus about speed.Only worry about growing your business to the next order of magnitude. Don’t worry about a 1 million users, when you have a 100 users.The moment you stop doing things that don’t scale, is the moment you give up one of your biggest advantages.Getting press! Types of stories: product launches, fundraising, milestones, business overviews, stunts, hiring announcements, and contributed articles.Think of a story, get introduced, set a date, reach out, pitch, follow up, and launch your news.Public relations firms, are likely a waste of time or too expensive for a startup.Make sure getting press is worth it, press does not mean that you are successful, and its completely not scalable.When evaluating a founder, evaluate: is this person a leader? Is this person obsessed with this product? Does this person possess strong communication skills?Venture capital is a business of outliers. A lot of startups that check all boxes, don’t hit a huge return. Investing in a team that has extreme strengths is a good strategy, as weaknesses can perhaps be fixed.You are almost always better off in making your business better and not making your pitch better. Almost everything you’ll ever do as a founder is harder than raising money. Raising money perhaps not a milestone or an accomplishment, it just empowers a founder to do the other things, which are harder and are important.Startups have multiple risks, launch, product, customer, etc. As a company grows, it achieves milestones, and reduces different layers of risk.If an investor makes a commitment, get in your car, type an email to confirm details.To raise a series A, a seed raise is required, unless it is a successful founder. This series A, is usually sold at 20–30%. It is important to pick a good seed investor, who has connections with venture capitalists. But it is quite difficult to figure out who is a good VC. 40% in an Angel round would demotivate a founder and the team.When you found a company, you have to find someone better than you to be a co-founder. The anomaly is Mark Zuckerburg as a solo co-founder.If your company goes great, it doesn’t matter who your investors are. But each large company, faces large storms, and through these storms it matters who are your co-founders, investors, etc. Think of an investment in a startup as an investment for life. Does a VC get your business? Do you respect their team?Each investment in a company, eliminates a company in that category, do to conflict policies. You don’t know which companies will come up next. The second issue isn’t the loss of funds, but the opportunity cost in human capital. Each open board seat that a firm takes, closes this possibility to take on a different board seat. A partner can take on 8–12 companies at a time. Given these two metrics, it is a high opportunity for one investment.If a startup goes well, the founder has control. If a startup is going poorly, the investors have control.What is culture?Assumptions beliefs, core values, behaviors, actions that pursue the company’s mission.One way to develop core values is to think about what you don’t want in an employee, and focus on creating the opposite. This is only step one though as teamwork, honesty, service are difficult to create.You go from building a product at first, and at some point you switch to growing a company. As a founder, you are the parent of a company. As a parent you want your child to out live you. So you have to create the right environment to maximize your child’s life.Integrity and honesty aren’t core values, they are what everyone should have. Airbnb only hires people who champion the mission, bring people together. Hire people who feel that working for airbnb is there calling.Culture does not pay off in the short term. Culture is an investment, that takes time. Stage 1 interview at Airbnb: if you could hire anyone in the world, would you hire the person that you are interviewing. Stage 2 does this person fit into our culture.Branding and culture are tied together. Culture is what happens inside the company. Brand is the promise outside the company. Your brand evangelists are your employees.The way to build a company is through vision, strategy, and through finding the right people. The way to win is to talk about what you value.Its better to have 100 people who love you as opposed to 1,000,000 people who like you. To create 100 users who love you, do things that don’t scale. Focus on creating a perfect experience for one person. Then extract information how this can be scaled. But the perfect experience for a small amount of customers must occur first.You can’t be involved in every decision of your business. Culture is geared to be a guide for other stakeholders for you as your company grows. The first 10 hires are the most important. Its difficult to sell top people, because top people can go to established startups. Also aside from talent, these individuals determine a lot of the trajectory environment of the company. You want people who will care so much, that even a small detail is a great pain, that each person on a startup team wants to fix. For the first 10 people work with them as much as possible prior to hiring on a full time basis. Like on a project for a week, its hard to fake it for a week.If you are hiring someone outside of your field, talk with leaders in your field how to determine whether someone is ‘World Class’. You want to learn what is good or bad prior to the interview process.A startup is a company that doesn’t have so many principal agent problems that are prevalent at large companies. So you can push 100% transparency. Stripe used (and may still) to bcc each other employee on every outgoing email, to create cohesion and share information.The advantage of working on a startup, is that no large company is crazy enough to give a relevantly new hire a massive responsibility. This responsibility is exciting, but just because an employee may fail, doesn’t mean that the employee is a failure.Look for trends in the changing technology factors. Goal of this talk is to convince someone to create an enterprise company.In the consumer space, you are always battling convincing someone to pay for your product or gain advertising. Paid apps 35 billion vs digital advertising $135 billion vs 3.7 trillion spent in the enterprise IT industry.Value equation is quite different for enterprise vs consumer. Consumers try to minimize cost or find the best deal. Enterprise space focus is productivity, things that are very high value, thus corresponding price points are higher.Enterprise products and sales appear complex. But everything about the enterprise market has changed since 2007. First, all companies are moving to the cloud. This has standardized platforms all companies employ. This reduces barriers to reach out to large companies. Second a company can now sell IT products to very small companies, which previously couldn’t afford to build or employ the infrastructure.Uber represents a shift in the entire transportation industry. Every industry is gong through a similar shift. And each company will need technology companies to facilitate this shift. Think about a multi-channel commerce. People want to buy goods at any place, at any time, with better information.Practical advice:Founders are thought of super heroes. But a single person never builds a business. There is such a diversity of skills is required to create a business, that a person needs help. Choosing good cofounders means choosing high achieving individuals who possess complimentary skills.In choosing a location for one’s business, choose a location with the strongest network for your business. Groupon, may not have grown in San Francisco. Groupon needed massive sales forces early on, and silicon valley is opposed to this mentality. Go to where your startup will be most successful.There is not one skill set to be a good founder, but you must process, adopt and build a coherent network, to become one.Building a company is putting all the irrational people in one room and moving forward. Growing a company is like a drawing that looks clean and neat but in reality it is an engine with duct tape. Ultimately you want to develop a high performing machine that is largely automated.Role of a leaderEarly on need to think about what actions are colds and which actions are fatal. To achieve this, need to edit. By editing shouldGoal over time is to use less red ink every day. Measure how much red ink you are creating each month, it should trend downwards. When you are unsure and there are low consequences, you should delegate. When it is a high risk decision, you can’t delegate. You need to try to explain why in your decision process.Important to edit the team. Think about people as gun barrels vs ammunition. Most people are ammunition. A barrel can take an idea through shipping and bring people with them. Its incredibly hard to find barrels.Test peoples roles and have it expand until it breaks and it will break.Where to focus on barrels? Insist on focus! A+ problems are difficult to solve, so these problems are easy for people to skip over. Force people to work on A+ problems.Metrics, analytics  transparency: Create a dashboard, that shows company performance. Measure how many employees employ this dashboard. Share board meeting decks and explain each slide. Share notes of each meeting greater than 2 people.Be smart with metrics, if you seek to minimize fraud, you may create a bad user experience.Details matter: If each person executes at a high level, a company will perform at a high level. Detail obsession is required to build a successful company. For example, food matters. If food is awful, people are unhappy, and complain about the food. If food is healthy and fantastic, people will focus on innovating. Same with space, space is a determinant of culture.Treat customer support like a product. You should have a one on one with each person you manage each week or two week. Agenda should be crafted by the employee.High levels employees can be evaluated by output divided by number of employees managed.When making a decision you have to be able to understand how this decision will be understood and affect each stakeholder in your company. Especially including individuals who may not be in the room.Example 1: Demote or Fire — hard worker, well liked, just not World Class. Think from perspective of yourself (CEO), employee, and everyone else.Example 2: Excellent Employee asks for a raiseNeed to create an evaluation process, and not offer raises outside of this process. Processes protect the culture.Who you talk to is just as important as what you ask them. Who would you go ask if you wanted to build a lecture taking note app?Figure out who is the most important person who would use an app. Beyond college students, you could talk to administrators, parents, and get familiar with the space.Throw an idea out, and see if sticks.For new products most people are non-users. If you only talk to people who employ your competitors, its difficult to expand the market.The features people were asking for weren’t that important. What was important, was the frustrations they discussed or what they really cared about. No one really does that, asks a person, what do you need, and then actually building that feature a month or two later. Recording interviews, is a positive.Don’t think about things, think about the user. JawBone focuses on Hardware + Software + Data, which is incredibly complex. Everything is a system.The process of creation:Sideways funnel of from wide to narrow left to right: exploration, early validation, concept, planning, development, and continued innovation.Exploration: Its a bit of an angel round science show. Would I give this guy 50,000?Early Validation: A lot of whys  howsConcept: Highly resolved whys, differentiation strategy, and road mapPlanning: Lots of trade offs, dealing with the reality of product, and financial limitations. At the end of the day, does this cross the value threshold to develop?Development: Sign off from design, hardware, software…We can dream a lot faster than we can innovate. It can take years to explore a process. One can skip steps, or go backwards through the steps. Again the focus is on the mindsetWhen entering a market blow it wide open by a magnitude of X….The easiest place to form a company is Delaware. It saves time  effort.Equity should be approximately equal. It is a red flag if this isn’t the case. The value of a company is in the long term future of that company. Thus the past is such a short period of time compared to the future that the past shouldn’t matter that much. A startup needs a complete team to execute, equal distribution of equity helps keep a team together.83b election is incredible important to sign and retain proof.Standard vesting is 4 years with a 1 year cliff. Meaning, after one year a founder receives 25% of her shares. If she leaves on this date, the company will buy back the remaining shares at the original price. Vesting creates an incentive structure to create founders on the team. Solo founders need vesting as well, it helps create a culture that we are in it for the long haul.Logistics of raising funds — priced vs non-priced rounds. Priced refers to value of the company.Seeds rounds are non-priced, which is quicker. Investors spend 100k now, and receive shares at a future value, at a future round. This is usually set at an upper bound, the cap. Imagine investing 2 million at a cap at 6 million cap. Then when the note converts, these investors could own 25%, plus the next round.Investors need to be sophisticated, as neighbors, family members, family friends, may not understand risks and that this is a long term investment.Investor requestsJust because the amount and type of financing is right, a founder needs to know everything about finances.Business expenses are the costs of running your business. Business expenses get deducted from revenue to reduce the tax liability. If you are embarrassed by an investor knowing about an expense, it is not a business expense. But you need to keep all receipts.Founders are an employee and need to get paid and pay payroll taxes. Set up a payroll service. Don’t go overboard with salaries. Founder breakups get super messy when there are unpaid wages. Because the company could have broken the law and the founder who is forced out can use this leverage for additional shares.For non-founders, one needs to figure out whether an someoneis a contractor or an employee. For contractors, the individual pays taxes and there are minimal liabilities. It is important to obtain an IP agreement.Again a payroll provider like Firing people is really hard. Fire quick, in person, with a third party. Pay all vacation and unpaid wages, cut off access, and repurchase all unvested stock.Running a company is knowing and following the rules!Talking to users is part of sales. As a founder you have unique advantages, knowledge about the product and passion! Build or Sell — nothing else matters!Sales funnel: prospecting, conversations, closing and revenue/promised land.Prospecting — find the innovators 2.5% of the market.Conferences are the place to go! Get the attendee list, write everyone in advance, set up meeting.Cold emails should be concise, clear.Conversations: shut up, listen, keep it simple.Religious Follow up…You want to get people to a yes or a no quickly! Maybes can be a pipeline of death.There are times that you want to pass on a customer. If they state they need one more feature.Instead of a free trail offer, with an annual contract, 30–60 days with the ability to void the contract.Develop your sales cycle based upon the amount of revenue that a customer will offer. A $10 customer is a much different sales cycle than a $10,000 sales cycle.Best way to improve your pitch is to improve your company.30 second pitch2 minute pitchRaise money when you have traction. How do create a scenario where you are strong compared to investors. Have you created a plan where you can grow with little or no money.To reach an investor, warm introductions are necessary, think in parallel, meaning schedule all meeting in the same week, “we are building crazy for 2 weeks, can we meet in the third week”, 1 team member should be invested in fundraising full time.Pitches:Tell a compelling narrative, make it collaborative, and be clear about numbers. Its obvious when people know their business. Anything other than a check is a NO. Create deal heat. Do diligence on the investors. Know who you are selling your company to. Know when to stop fundraising, because it is easier than building a company. Building a company is the goal not fundraising.Companies are flat until about 25 employees. When lack of structure fails, it is a disaster. The structure doesn’t need to be a complicated. There needs to be clear and simple employee structure. You want to innovate on your product don’t innovate on the business structure. Seriously, don’t make it complicated.Failure cases:Codify how you and the company does things. Every founder wishes they wrote down how and why earlier.Human Resources can speed a company up! It creates a clear structure, offers performance feedback which should be simple and frequent, compensation bands tied to performance and equate.Equity be generous: your investors will give you bad advice, give 3–5% a year. Keep up with refresher grants to stay in front of individuals vesting schedules. Think of structures such as 6 years, pyramid vesting, and continuous forward vesting and get a management forward system.There are a lot of rules that change at 50 employees.Monitor your team for burnout, the company is in a different stage and stability is key.Announce every offer internally before externally.Create a program to onboard new employees.Productivity per employee goes down as it grows. Single most important word is alignment. Test: ask founders and pull 10 random employs, what are the top three goals for the company. Important to reiterate goals and road map.Transparency and communication is crucial to creating alignment.The goal is to build a company that creates enduring value over a long period of time.Most companies do one great thing that the founder pushes along, but repeated innovation is so rare.As the company grows, the psychological intensity for founders increases. When you are small, people love you, when you grow haters grow. Ignore them… Take vacation and monitor burnout.Acquisition offers can tank a company. It is demoralizing if it doesn’t happen, can kill morale.Startups fail when founders quit.Founders need to figure out the key messages of the company, and repeat it again and again.for dealsWow, I can’t believe I completed this 16 hour marathon.

1. Building Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) is easy. Knowing which assumptions to validate is not.2. Rejection, not failure, is the default state of startups (from market, family and investors).3. Learning to code is not essential, but it’s important and helpful when you can’t hire/find technical talent.4. Entrepreneurship is learning to live in a constant state of uncertainty. Yes, endless doubts every single day.5. Nailing an MVP fast involves a certain degree of luck. It takes time to find the right distribution channels.6. The success of a product can be highly dependent on its design at the first stages of a startup.7. Great design comes with great understanding of a problem. “How it works not how it looks” Jobs’s motto, is what matters.8. Arrogance kills you and your relationships. Then your startup dies.9. Learning curves are underestimated. A lot of time in startups goes into learning how to do new things you ignored and can’t hire people to do.10. Motivation is hard. Keeping your team motivated comes from you being motivated. Startups don’t run on cash only but on morale too.11. Startups are creative organizations that might turn into businesses one day. Many startup investors think they invest in the latter.12. Build something for yourself is dangerous advice, you risk building something only you want. It is fun though.13. Finding liquidity in startups is hard. It’s almost unethical to take money from friends, fools and family without product market fit.14. San Francisco can be the cheapest city on earth for a startup founder. The benefit-cost ratio when meeting the right people is extremely high.15. The very first MVP is finding people with similar interest. Then building/ joining a community around that interest.16. Building a company is not the same as managing a company. In the beginning, the most important thing is managing yourself.17. Leadership is a daily decision. Doing what you say, setting the example and inspiring others is what matters.18. Mixing hobbies and passion with work can backfire. Money pressure can take the beauty out of anything. Mastering the balance is an art.19. There are no startup experts. Every startup is related to the uniqueness of their founders. Be wary of startup experts.20. The best startup pieces of advice I’ve found are stories from other founders. Taking the best out of them and learning is a continuous challenge.21. Starting a startup is a gamble. The more educated the gamble the better. It’s important to know the history of your industry.22. Networking is most effective when you can bring value to the network. Most people just want to extract value.23. “Focus on your strengths” is a luxury for startups. It’s the biggest excuse not to do something you’re startup needs because you ignore how to do it.24. Venture capital is helpful but can be addictive. It’s hurtful when you don’t have it and think you need it.25. Being delusional kills startups. Most founders are delusional. Meditation helps.26. Capital does not precede success, it works the other way around.27. Try not to spend a week without talking or listening to people who are successful at what they do.28. Almost every design fault or bug can be fixed with great customer service.29. If you want to become something hang out with people who are already that something.30. If you want an audience be part of the audience first.______________These are not rules just personal reflections as I turn thirty today.

Startups seem so glamorous. The awkward college dropout who locked himself in a garage for a few years to create technology that would go on to revolutionize the world. That’s a narrative we’re all very familiar with at this point. And thanks to shows like But what’s becoming increasingly more apparent to me is that So with this blog post, I’m aiming to provide a bit of clarity to those thinking about launching a startup. Hopefully, by the time you’re done reading it, you’ll be able to identify the major differences between a startup and a small business and feel better equipped to make a decision about which one’s best for you.Oh, and let me get this out of the way up front: in some circles, the term “startup” is not used to describe a Ok, so here it is…Either way, understanding the differences between a startup and a small business, and recognizing your personal power to choose the one that’s best for you, is an important skill to have. It’s a skill that will help you align your actions to your expectations and empower you to select the right plan to reach your desired destination.Checkout my new site, -Portfolio Services Director at Kapor Capital | Founder of The Startup Couch | Forbes 30 Under 30 | TEDx Presenter | Handpicked business, marketing, design, and technology articles for entrepreneurs and startups.

When advising or mentoring startup founder-CEO’s, or when governing my own priorities as the CEO of A. If cash is getting low, meet with investors. Without cash on hand nothing else matters and its not profitability that kills startups, its cash flow.B. If your cash position is fine, focus on growth levers (sales/customers/users). Help sell to win business so that cash doesn’t get low or focus on product/UX. This approach allows you to ensure the product roadmap is aligned to market needs.Side note: Fundraising never ends. Meet with new  existing investors before you need money. You should be using the meeting to plant seeds and to figure out what metrics they would want to see in order to participate in the next fundraise. Use those metrics to guide priorities internally.A. Provide consistent updates to the team. Share victories and challenges across the org. Strong communication is the basis of any good relationship and you need a good relationship with your team.B. Give employees a platform to communicate publicly and privately. Proactively address individual and group concerns and make changes based on this feedback.C. Spend time recruiting. If you are actively hiring this should be a top priority, if you aren’t but you get referred to a potential candidate, always meet them and consider it an opportunity to impress (whether you would hire them or not).A. The role of a CEO is to be able to steer and balance a company with limited resources on a path toward profitability, financing, and/or an exit. Like a kid trying to solve a maze with a pencil, start at the end and work backwards. What are the tactics required to execute the strategy. What most people don’t realize is that the early success of startups is almost always about tactics rather than strategy.B. Be involved with all aspects of the business but defer to experts and empower stakeholders. This will also provide motivation throughout.C. Have contingency plans for contingency plans knowing that almost no model is ever accurate, and things usually dont go as smooth as you hope (especially early on)A. Make sure employees know the latest story. They are your biggest advocates so make sure they know the latest and greatest version of the story.B. From 1B, talk to customers. But even more importantly listen to what they want.C. Make sure investors know the latest, provide regular updates and ask for help.D. Actively blog, tweet, and engage the press and other outlets as well with important business updates. Media relationships can be just as important as key client and investor relationships.Culture is often times formed top down whether deliberately or subconsciously.

A couple of months back I wrote a piece called “[ Click to Tweet (can edit before sending): PG recently wrote a related piece, I do these calculations in my head instantly when talking to founders by asking them a series of questions in our meetings:1. “How many people do you need to build and maintain the product?” then…2. “How much are you going to charge for the product?” then…3. “How many customers do you think you’ll have at the end of year one … and two?”Now I can just direct people to this simple page — brilliant!I angel invest in awesome startups... and try to build them myself. Be excellent to each other.

We launched During these 22 months, I learned a lot about what a startup actually is, made a shit load of mistakes, and went through the biggest personal change of my entire life.The following are my lessons learned (in no particular order) — about building a startup, the culture, partners and myself.These were and are true for me — some or all of them may be completely untrue for someone else:I’m now learning my next 34 lessons.Co-founder, Swayy.

I believe that ambitious startup ideas have similar success probabilities to their less ambitious counterparts, if not higher success rates. No, I don’t have any hard evidence. Call it a highly educated guess.Ambitious startup ideas usually operate in Contrast that outcome with a less ambitious startup idea, which usually means picking a niche market ahead of timeAnother contributing factor is ambitious startup ideas are attractive to the ecosystem of startup land. If the idea is the brain, everything else you will eventually need is the body (employees, investors, press, etc.). An ambitious startup idea with just a little bit of traction attracts all the right body parts. A non-ambitious startup idea with just a little bit of traction languishes on Gabriel Weinberg, Founder  CEO, DuckDuckGo.

Dear Friends and Fans of Cheezburger,After 8 incredible years, I am stepping down from being CEO of Cheezburger today.I will remain a Board member. Cheezburger’s President and COO, Scott Moore will step in to the CEO role with my full support. Scott has proven to be a skilled operator and a steadfast leader. He has taught me a lot about being strategic, decisive, and positive. He has taught me that I have much to learn, and I am grateful for his dedication to Cheezburger. I will miss working with him daily.I recommended this change to our Board as we continue to get closer to profitability. We have been preparing for this transition for the last few months and I have learned that our investors are truly exceptional people as they have repeatedly demonstrated their helpfulness. I am thankful for their support during this change.Emily and I have sprinted a marathon for the past 8-years. We became Internet Famous before there was Internet Famous, thanks to all of our users. I could not have guessed how starting a company and buying a lolcat website called Cheezburger gave rise to a new category of content, a new industry of global reach, and as some would call it: the downfall of civilization. I say, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ bring it on, because it looks like a lot of fun. We have made a dent in the universe together and Cheezburger will continue to do so without me. This company has taught me that I have talents and skills beyond what I could imagine and I want to continue that journey.A person’s character is shaped from his or her circumstances and our circumstances have been extraordinary. I am grateful for our luck. Who else can say they had this much fun running a start up through the Great Recession? I have tasted many victories and humbling moments, sometimes in the same day.I will miss our creative bat-shit insane ideas that end up working. I will miss the dedication and craftsmanship of our technical and product teams. I will miss staying up impatiently all night waiting for something, anything to go live. I will miss the random hysterical laughter in the office. I may or may not miss the finer points of what constitutes a visible nipple, but I will miss the discussions about the artistic merit of photobombs, and I will also miss telling a co-worker to tell an advertiser to fuck off, but not really going through with it. I will miss all of you who are and were a part of our motley crew who built an impossible dream.I have many regrets but I learned that, just like fear, regrets have no place in life. I have learned that the greatest triumphs of our lives are disguised by their difficulty, so we should celebrate our difficulties as well as our wins.It’s hard for me to think of the days before I started Cheezburger, Inc. (née Pet Holdings). I hope I have matured as a leader, learned new skills, and have given my best in the worst, the best, and the most mundane of times. Many talented people have walked into our offices, and I have been wowed by their passion and the vigor with which they have applied their full talents to make our mission come true:My belief in that mission is unwavering. And Cheezburger will continue to work towards that mission under a new CEO.There will always be a hole in my heart for this team, for this community, and for why we do what we do. There will always be a hole in my heart to wake up every morning to conquer the day’s challenges with a team that believes passionately in the same purpose. My experience with my fellow Cheezburgers has taught me to be deeply human — something we need more in life and in business.The time has come for Emily and I to go on another unscripted adventure, without a reality TV crew. The ceaseless march of time is a wonderful gift — a gift that reminds us that we have no one to be accountable to but the longing in our hearts and to those we love near and far. If you are lucky to have friends who help you face reality with honesty, as we do, you’ll find that you are loved by many, life is temporary, and the only barrier to happiness is your own fear and guilt.Just last month, another chapter in my life came to an end with the closure of Circa. There are many ways to interpret the timing of life’s moments, but the one I choose is to be thankful that I received an opportunity to neatly wrap up this stage of my work. Now it is time for me to create pause and be mindful of what I will do, who I am, and to write about lessons learned that may be helpful to all of us.Emily and I do not fear change. Being dragged by certain change is but a slow death, so we will lead ourselves into the deep end. We’ve been there, and that deep end is a surprising and wondrous place. Sometimes, it’s filled with cat allergens and a day full of eye-clawing misery. Sometimes, it’s life-changing treasure we haven’t yet learned to value. Sometimes, it’s seeing the beauty of your wife/co-worker/pain-in-my-ass in her wisdom, creativity, and ass-kicking skills. Emily continues to surprise me even after 14 years together. We will dive again into that deep end holding hands, knowing that everything will be OK, and we will find ourselves reinvented.An adventure is a journey that redefines a life where that defining moment cannot be forecast. Being CEO and Founder of Cheezburger, Inc. has been a true adventure and one that has helped me grow into the person I am today. I cannot thank you enough for being a part of this adventure.After we leave this office with smiles on our faces, tears in our eyes, and love in our hearts, I can be followed Sincerely,Ben HuhCEO and Founder of Cheezburger and co-founder of Circa.

Investing your life in a startup.Don’t waste a year at a company that you don’t believe in.Before you join a startup, put yourself in the mindset of a Venture Capitalist. You want to make sure that your investment (time), has the chance of delivering massive returns. For you, this can take a few forms: learning valuable skills, building a strong network, fast-tracking career advancement, or making tons of money through stock options.Those outcomes are more likely to happen if you join a small company that grows to be a massive one. Ask yourself some of these questions before you invest time, your scarcest resource, into a company.Startups’ personalities closely resemble those of their CEO. If you don’t believe in the CEO, why would you work for their company?Do some Twitter sleuthing to find out as much as you can. If she has 15k plus followers, you can assume people care about what she has to say. Eavesdrop on some of her conversations. Is she engaging? Combative? Does she seem like a total ass-kicker or a lame boss?Stick with your gut feeling. If she exhibits traits you admire, that’s one point for the startup. If she seems like she would be a drag to work for, look elsewhere.This is one of the hardest characteristics to identify from the outside. But, give it a shot.Hit Google hard to uncover the pedigrees of all the C-level executives. Is your goal to become the best marketer in the world? Someone on the management team should have experience building a baller marketing team.Do you want to build a powerful network? Find out if someone on the management team has connections to YCombinator or another dense startup network.Look beyond the most senior people. If they can’t If you’re unimpressed, that’s a point against the startup.Is the company “so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute?” If so, it may just have If it is just another food delivery app, workout app, or photo-sharing service, the company may not give you the opportunity to reach the heights you’re shooting for.Don’t work for a company building a product you don’t believe in.If you don’t love it, why would anyone else outside of the company? The chances of a company with a crap product blowing up are slim. The company has a better chance of succeeding if people at the company are willing to spend 70+ hours a week busting their asses. Who’s going to do that if they could care less about the product?Don’t lie to yourself. If you don’t enjoy the product or service, move your focus elsewhere.Time to hit the newsstand.Read TechCrunch articles about the company. Search the company name on Twitter. Google Hacker News and [company name] to hear what the startup community thinks. See what people are saying on reddit for a brutally honest view of the company.If the internet is buzzing, that’s a good sign. Does the TechCrunch writer seem miserable to be writing the story? Be aware of little things like that.This one is just like recruiting a good team.If the founders can’t convince quality investors of their vision, the company will run out of cash and die before it has the chance to be a massive success.If they can convince the big investors, it means one thing; they are growing at a breakneck pace.It may just be worth getting on for the ride.Marketing A Collection of Posts from the Mattermark Team

By Crickets.You know the sound.It’s what you hear when there is:And it’s the sound that most startups and new companies hear when they push the magic “go” button and launch their business to the rest of the world.All day, they look at their stats, page views, and other vanity metrics that don’t really mean much.And after the crickets come and go, it’s an uphill battle to get attention, traffic, and gain back the excitement you and your team had leading up until that fateful button pushing moment.Quick question for ya…You spend six months or more of your life squashed in your office chair hammering away at code, or tweaking your website design, or creating videos, or writing sales copy to sell your product or service.And when you finally get all the pixels perfect, you push the button and “hope” people will sign up, buy it, use it, or come back to your website ever again.My friend Jeff Walker, author of Noah Kagan, founder of Appsumo and SumoMe says…Listen up…Walk into any VC’s office and tell him that your marketing strategy is called Yet, “hope marketing” is what is permeating the business world and it’s getting worse!Ever heard or said this before?This, by definition… is “Hope Marketing.”And if you’ve ever said that, then you, my friend, may just be… Oh, the horror!Unfortunately, it’s as common as Peanut Butter  Jelly, yet it doesn’t have to be this way.Jurassic Park just came out a few weeks ago and good lord, it was everywhere!I turned on NatGeo and they’re talking about Dinosaurs. Freaking velociraptors, pterodactyls, and of course… T-Rex.I popped open Xinfity on-demand and what do I see?Billion year old dragons flying across my screen: Dinosaurs.Heck, I even rented Jurassic Park 1, 2, and 3 on Amazon Video to quench my Dinosaur appetite *they* secretly drummed up in me.Look…The producers at Legendary Films are doing all of this for one reason and one reason only…To capture your attention, spark your interest, stir up the intense desire to get out of your fart bucket to give them money.And hot-diggity! It worked!Now imagine, if they took a “hope marketers” approach and opened up on some random Friday night and waited to see what would happen.Nope. Not even close.Grasshopper, look beyond the money.It’s about the process.It’s about “content” and “distribution.”Let me explain…When creating a new product or service there’s one thing that’s always certain — you will go live one day.There will be a “launch” day.And that day can be a great success or none at all.Here’s 3 simple things you should be doing MONTHS in advance before you launch.This is not a corporate board per se, but it’s first to build your influencer channel and group of people who can spread the word quickly to their target audience.This doesn’t have to be huge names or a list of impossibles, but people who can directly influence their network to sign up and buy your product or service.In other words, influencers who have your target market as their audience.A few years ago, we built a list of 35 “influencers” in the Raw Foods niche and on launch day, with a quick email from just 3 partners, These were regular people who had nothing special except an email list and some minor influence.How did we get them?Easy.Go to Google, type in your niche keywords, get their name, email, and mailing address, then write them a LETTER about what you are doing that invites them to become a launch partner.For us, 35 said “heck yes!” yet 3 made up the 80% of traffic and sales.Who are good partners?Here’s a list of places to find great partners…you’ll want to break open Excel and build this list.A great software to use to quickly build a list of awesome partners is It’s a business development person’s DREAM!No. You shouldn’t.Yes, those work, but MAN… they are hard to produce!Instead, produce a 4 part video training series that shares some amazing strategies, insights, steps, and methods for helping your target audience get better results for what your product provides.For example, if you’re offering a dating product, the end result for the user may be to “get a date.”So the The The And the If your product is not ready yet, then you could offer a like Kickstarter-like approach to have people pledge to gain access to certain levels of your product or service, so you can get money today while you’re building it.This whole 4-part series walks the visitor down the path to getting the end result, which is your product or service.Does your market have problems and challenges?If you answered yes, then you just answered your question.Let’s say you had an email marketing software and the goal people need to learn is how they can use email to generate sales, so what would they NEED to learn to make that happen?First, then need to get people to Second, then need to get people to Then Third, they need to know what mistakes to avoid along the way…And finally Now obviously that’s an example, but you get the idea.Show people the PROCESS to get the result they are looking for.Lead with content, then promote with passion.By sending out those letters, you hopefully landed a few “partners” to help you spread the word.And because this series is entirely FREE, the partners can feel great about sharing it and giving it to their audience.You’ll want to set a date when each video will go live and let your partners know that on x date each video will go out. (On September 15th at 12:00pm EST the first video goes live!)It’s important to have your partners invite their audience to the content on the same day so your content can penetrate the market quickly from all angles.Don’t launch to crickets.Do what Jurassic Park and others successful promotions do.Create compelling content (education and training), secure your distribution outlets (and partners), and spread the word.Obviously, there’s in’s and out’s — but that’s the simple process at it’s core.We’ve used this process successful for almost every product or project we’ve ever launched and each time it proves to work.Not only in sales figures, but with traffic, leads, and attention in the market.Now, go ahead and create your own Jurassic Park attention getting machine.CoFounder of Call Loop  Automize.

This is not going to be a lecture on typography or color palettes and it’s not going to require you to have the latest Creative Suite from Adobe. In fact, you don’t even need to be a designer or UX expert to use any of these principles.Instead I want to try and get you past what UX, designers and other experts think and give you some principles to work with.Is it the brand? The choice of colors, the functionality, the language, the platform or network effects? All of the above certainly have some importance, but it’s going to be very hard to insist that one particular element is why a company is successful.Yet all too often we become attached to this idea that there is a recipe for success. That if you just get the right concept or your design is beautiful and uses a certain technology, you will be successful.Nothing in my experience, supports that belief. In fact there are as many roads to success as there are to failure more over — what mean success for one company, might spell failure for another.When you are building a startup, one of the most important things you can learn is how to prioritize. If you are a first time founder the main challenge you are going to ask yourself is who you should listen to. Designers are going to make you want to prioritize design. Developers are going to make you prioritize technology. All of them have really good arguments for why they should be prioritized.Large organizations can afford to prioritize many different areas at once. To them launching a product is itself a sign of success almost no matter how well it does. They have the money to continue down a dead–end and will invest millions in doing all the right things from research, usability tests and 5 different design proposals, to establishing brand guidelines or build a customized database protocol and then launch something, two years too late, to great fanfare and often, into great obscurity.If you are a startup you don’t have that luxury (or shouldn’t have). You wont be able to spend that much time and money building spaceships no one want to fly. You need to prioritize.One of the hardest parts about being a founder of a startup though, is to figure out how much importance you should put on the different things. How important is design actually?My general advice to all the founders I have worked with have always been the same:Of course the problem with this advice is that it leaves out how to get to that point. So normally would have a chat with theses startups to help them get the most out of design using the least amount of resources. I can’t do that here, so instead I am going to distill these chats into what I consider to be some principles that, if applied properly, will help you get to your first customer.Most products are simple, based on simple insights.Make sure that you stay true to those insights until you know you explored every avenue. Don’t add new features just because you think that it will help you be successful, it wont, not yet at least. If your product becomes a success, it’s not because of how many features it has but whether you found a pain point for your customers.Furthermore, if it goes like it does in most cases, you will soon enough have to spend resources on changing things after you launch. Resources that you just wasted on thinking you improved you product.Your customers hasn’t spent months playing around with every aspect of your product, so don’t try to impress them with features before they understand what your product is all about. Spotify has many flaws, Basecamp leaves a lot to be asked for. But when all is said and done, their products are rock solid. And there is no feature like the rock solid feature.A common misconception a lot of startups have, is that you should test your product on your users before you launch. The belief is that it will allow you to catch some of the worst mistakes before you launch your product. Don’t believe the hype, I say this as someone who used to make a living doing usability tests too. There are situations where usability studies make sense for startups, but most likely it wont be in your situation.I wrote a In most cases where you do usability testing, you are testing in a pseudo environment with mock-ups, html prototypes or even paper prototypes. Just imagine how Twitter, SMS, Google or Facebook in it’s early days would have scored by the standards normally applied.Unless you are inventing some completely new interface paradigm or a new input device where you are looking for the optimal version, chances are someone else have already solved it for you. Use it, stand on the shoulders of giants, there is no shame in that.So many products and services need to be experienced before users will provide you with any valuable insights to build on and even more will only show you valuable data if you have a lot of test-samples. It would be like trying to determine the usage and usability of a hammer by looking at a piece of paper with a drawing of it.Think about features as something to add after you have launched.A hammer has one purpose, which is to help you knock in nails. Everything on top of that is features. Therefore — understand when you are working on your core product and when you are working on adding features.The benefits of thinking like this, is that it will help you establish a very clear an precise picture of what makes your product your product. Which means you will much better be able to understand why you are adding features when you are and won’t get caught in the “me to” behavior that can drive companies out of business very fast.Think about how you can stand out by introducing something that everyone else might have but in a unique way. That’s what You will be surprised how much the “how” can help improving your product.If you can’t answer the above, you probably shouldn’t do it.All to often companies get caught in thinking that new technology in itself is the differentiation factor. But as most successful businesses know. Innovations have an introduction curve and not everyone should take advantage of a given technology just because it’s available.As with everything else here in life, the real challenge isn’t to figure out all the things you want to do, but what you want to spend your time on. Building a startup is no different. Hopefully these principles will help you better understand how to apply design to your situation. If you have some other principles I would love to hear about them.Published inInternational Trouble MakerThe troubled issue

Over the last 18 months, I’ve invested in over 150 startup companies. I’ve put money to work in areas such as online video, virtual reality, genome engineering, home automation, electric bicycles, bitcoin, insect protein, a new airline and of course a ton of apps. I invested alongside notable angels like Until recently, it was very difficult, if not impossible for an outsider to invest in a promising young company. Now anyone* can invest in the hottest new Silicon Valley startups without getting off their couch.Back in December 2013, I came up with the idea to create a SAngelList organized this concept into structured syndicates. Individuals can join a syndicate led by a well-known investor and get access to their upcoming deals. For the privilege of joining a syndicate, you have to pay a carry percentage to the lead investor. This is basically a percentage of the profits of any successful investment with the majority of fees falling between 10–20%. After writing the initial article, I applied to, and was accepted to back several syndicates on AngelList. I waited months but not a single deal was proposed from any of them. It took so long in fact, that I ended up doing my first investment through a different platform called Alphaworks, which is now Quire.Finally, in April 2014, Jason Calacanis started pushing deals through his syndicate and I made my first investment through AngelList. I actually went on to fund three companies with him in the first three months. Two of my first five companies didn’t come through any of the syndicates I was involved with at the time, but they were great deals that I didn’t want to miss, namely AirHelp and Boostable.Within the first few months, I started to have problems getting into competitive deals. SEC regulations state that investment syndicates can only have 99 investors in each deal. For the most obvious winners in the pack, there were a lot of people waiting in line. In an attempt to create order, AngelList gave priority to investment amount for each deal. However, my entire strategy was to invest smaller amounts in more deals so that didn’t help much.The proposed answer to these problems was the AngelList Syndicates Fund. AngelList essentially created an investment product to do exactly what I was trying to do, except with access to all the deals and without any management bandwidth needed. You fundamentally act as a limited partner by writing the fund a check and then have no control over how the capital is deployed. On the surface, it sounded like a great idea but there were a lot of outstanding questions. What would be the criteria for their investments? What stage of company would they be primarily looking at? How large a fund would they be raising and how long would it take to deploy that much capital? The biggest question in my mind was who was ultimately deciding which checks to write and whether or not I would agree with their strategy.I imagine there are at least two different types of investors that would buy into this concept. The first type would be looking solely at financial return and couldn’t care less what went on until the fund was spent and any capital and profits were returned. The second type, like myself, was interested in how the money was spent, how the decisions were made, and what I could learn from having an inside look at the fund operations. I was told information would be passed along soon after an investment was made in the beginning and that AngelList was working on a more structured way to monitor the portfolio in the future.Thankfully, there is now a screen that I can access that shows the entire fund portfolio as well my personal contribution to the investment so that I have a good idea of where my money went. Unfortunately the data is quite limited and I feel that there is definitely some key data missing to properly assess the strength of the initial investment and the ongoing health of the portfolio. Again, nothing was promised and nothing more is owed, but for those that would like to understand current market value and monitor their progress, there is not enough raw data to make any deductions.I can see the name of the company, the syndicate the fund invested alongside, the date of the investment and of course the amount. What I can’t see is the investment round (seed, series A, etc), the pre-money valuation of the investment or any further investments to the company. If I visit the company’s public AngelList page, sometimes I can see the date an investment round closed, and then I can cross-reference the syndicate investment date to try to determine how large the round was, but I’ve already made mistakes using this methodology. Also, many company pages don’t list their funding round dates or amounts so there’s literally no information except for when and how much money you’ve invested in a company. Hopefully AngelList can provide an update with more tools around this in the future.Even with all that said, I still have a pretty good idea of what’s actually going on with the various investments. I’ve made several attempts at portfolio tracking including of course various spreadsheets and I even created an account with one of the portfolio companies, The first thing I do when I see a headline with a company I know I’ve got money in is check to see exactly how much the fund invested. A maximum of 1% of the total fund was invested in any single startup with smaller rounds or more competitive investments getting less. Just like in real life, the best deals are crowded and sometimes it’s a win just to be included. With setups like this, the math can be amusing. The smallest deal I can see is that apparently I’ve got a whopping $3 into one particular company, I’m not sure it was worth the paperwork.A few of my favorites in no particular order are:Of course along with the standouts come the opposite. There were definitely a few deals where I was left scratching my head trying to figure out what the fund manager was thinking. Most people look at the same criteria when analyzing the strength of an early stage startup: team, the problem being solved, market size and of course traction. My thesis for a syndicate fund would heavily weigh the investor leading the syndicate, which to me would indicate positive track record, potential deal-flow as well as the quality of the due diligence. There were a handful that I’ve yet to figure out why the investment was selected, although I’m sure there’s a story behind it. Why As of today, at least 20 of the companies I’ve invested in have already gone on to receive follow-on funding rounds which is an excellent sign. The fund itself has participated in several follow-ons for their portfolio companies. Early stage funding will typically last between 1–2 years for a young company so it’s still much too early to determine overall success of the portfolio. Ideally, an investor would be looking for 1 in 10 companies to be standout investments and so far I’m on the right track.I wouldn’t recommend anyone to put more than 5% of his or her investment assets into startups. It’s highly speculative and extremely risky. That being said, if you do want to put some capital to work, I would recommend looking at AngelList syndicates to get the job done instead of trying to source your own deals and find local companies to back. Keep in mind that the minimum buy-in for the general fund is currently $50,000 and the smaller more focused funds are at $10,000. If you’d like to back an individual syndicate, the price of admission is $1,000. If Title III of the JOBS Act passes soon, I’d expect there to be even more activity around this space and possibly new instruments to take advantage of.I personally plan to keep leveraging syndicates for deal flow and diligence. If you do too, here are some tips. I think Jason Calacanis (As with any class of investment, there are always macro economic factors to consider. Be sure to understand the Series A crunch and the amount of investment activity at different points in the startup lifecycle. Are we in a bubble? For later stage investments, and the so-called billion dollar unicorn companies, how will they find their exit? If you do participate in the later stage rounds with higher valuations, do the terms of the deal give you adequate liquidation preference? If something written here doesn’t make sense to you, be sure to do some more research before spending any money.As for myself, I think I’ll skip the next structured AngelList fund and return to investing in individual deals for the time being. There are definitely a few all-star companies that I would have missed out on if I had been making all the calls up to this point, but I do miss being in control of my own destiny.Follow me on twitter Founder at pivotshare.com, All things #startup, venture capital,  #technology.

The transfer from client orientation to start-ups taught me a lot. I would recommend it really to every designer, so I wrote down a couple of remarks from the position of a designer.The designer knows how to create a beautiful User Interface from a non-functioning concept, which stuns his colleagues, gets 300 likes and will look ingenious, but in reality won’t be usable at all.The wealthy bourgeois start-ups do it differently. They have a lot of time and a lot of designers so they can afford to have each concept with a beautiful UI. However, in the end it’s useless, because a good design intentionally hides usability, so the company needs more time to find out why a given concept works (or doesn’t work).However, an extremist offshoot of designer existentialists says that it is better to have a beautiful design of a non-functioning web than an ugly design of a non-functioning web. Yes, they are right: Actually, this is what I thought at the beginning. But after years, I learned that it works differently when you are in a start-up.You cannot bother your colleagues with every little thing. One has to understand what is the release goal and function, and react based on that. If it is a feature that will be used by 5% of the users, I’d leave it. But if it is pricing, which will affect the business in a very real way, then one has to fight.It is necessary to understand that if we don’t push the coders when we are in the home stretch, we are saving them valuable time. At the same time our product can grow faster, thus increasing our chance for survival. Gradually, your colleagues start to ignore InvisionApp, the reminders don’t work anymore, all your friends are sick and tired. What now? What’s proven to work is to ask colleagues for feedback only for the most important revisions.On the one hand, your team is the most precious source of feedback, but on the other, the feedback gradually dries up. Therefore, think twice before seeking it. TIP: It’s fine to create one channel in Slack, where you regularly post your designs. The goal is to have them at least seen by someone so maybe he leaves you feedback. But be prepared, you may have to actively ask for feedback from several platforms — in combination with email, personally through Facebook, etc. One channel is never enough. The designer cannot get angry with his colleagues if they don’t respond. One just has to chase them and face it.Published inDesigner  co-founder of sli.do — Passionate about User Interfaces — Former Audi  Skoda Auto designer — A person who behaves sportingly in real life.Handpicked business, marketing, design, and technology articles for entrepreneurs and startups.

The term “startup” has been thrown around with such frequency that it’s hard to tell what it means anymore. People use the “S” word to describe everything from single person LLC’s to ten plus thousand employee corporations. So, what is a startup anyway?Luckily, Paul Graham has pretty much solved this debate for us years ago. If you haven’t read I also really love Adora Cheung’s, cofounder and CEO of Homejoy, definition though, as it applies more to the people who join your startup:By this definition, startups are unstable, and employees sacrifice stability for making an exciting and big impact.Those two definitions compliment each other quite well, because I believe part of what makes a startup unstable is either lack of growth, or too much of it. A startup is a company designed to grow fast, and because of that fact, it’s inherently unstable. To continue to go off of Paul’s barbershop example, if a barbershop had 25 customers per day over the last 6 months, then youve got yourself a pretty stable and predictable business. However, if somehow the shop was getting more and more customers every day, then every few months, or weeks, everything would have to change in order to support the growing clientele. That’s not so stable (but exciting!). Basically, if you’re not ready for some wild and crazy changes while you go through a company’s growth stage, then you don’t have the startup mindset.Paul Graham also explains that the growth of a successful startup usually has three phases:We’re going through the rapid growth period at Imgur, particularly internally. After five years of growing all the way to 100 million unique visitors, we only grew internally to 12 people. Eventually, we started having to pass up too many opportunities because we simply didnt have the employee bandwidth to go after them. I knew we had to start growing internally to support our external growth. Why didnt we just hire more people earlier? Well for one, it’s hard, and (for better or worse) it was easier to focus on the product. For two, we were bootstrapped, and even if we were able to find more people, we were limited by our revenue.That changed last year when we raised our $40 million series A. What a time to be alive! The first thing we started doing was hiring, and exactly one year later, we’re up to 47 people. Almost quadruple the amount and an average of 3 people a month. Not bad. However, it turns out that a 12 person company is vastly different from a 24 person company, and is even more different from a 47 person company. It seems like things are completely changing every 3 months, and in fact, they are. We arent stopping either. By the end of this year, we’ll be up to 90 people which is finally what the product deserves, at a growth rate that is realistic. However, with that comes a great amount of instability. Things are going to change even more, and employees and investors need to embrace that fact. After all, instability is in our definition. Along with growth, it’s what defines us.When you grow this fast your processes break down and need to be changed, communication among the company gets harder, people will develop conflicting goals, you’ll get pushed and pulled in so many different directions you may not know what you’re doing anymore, there will be more meetings, more opinions, more products, more interviews, more arguments, and more stress, all with less time. It’s hard, really hard, but this is what it means to be in a startup, and if it’s successful, it will all be well worth it.When we first started growing our employees I was scared. I would often think, “if we had more people, what would they do? Is there really enough work?” (In fact, my mom still wonders why we have any employees at all. “It’s just a website, isnt it?” JUST A WEBSITE?! C’mon, Mom!) The answer, however, is always. There’s always enough work as long as you hire driven, motivated, and smart people. They will always find work and always find things to improve. Unfortunately though, it’s tough to hire just a bunch of smart people and have them do whatever they want. You need a structure, priorities, they all need to be moving in the same direction, and above all else, you need vision.At Imgur, we need a solid product that works on various platforms, so we’re looking at iOS, android, frontend, backend, and devops. Those products need to work and look great, so we have product management and design. We need great content and a great culture on Imgur so we need a team for that as well (our community team). We need to make money, so we have sales and ad-ops. We have to spread the word about the stories that people are sharing from the community, so we have PR. We also need the standard operating teams such as legal, finance, accounting, and HR. So, as it turns out, it’s incredibly easy to have a small startup that needs a ton of people for a seemingly simple product.After a while, these teams will grow and become too hard to manage. Jeff Bezosis’ “two pizza rule” is so accurate it should be a law. That is, any team should be small enough to be fed with two pizza’s. If it can’t be fed with two pizza’s, then it’s too big and should be broken down. For Imgur, this means about 7 people (everyone gets about two slices). I also believe that teams should be run like startups. There should be a single lead, and they should have all the resources they need to be successful. For products, this means you have typically have a PM, a few designers, a few developers, and the team lead is usually technical and drives the success of the team. These teams are also “mission based” teams, where they have a single mission, or goal, that they go after relentlessly. They should be focusing one hundred percent of their time on achieving their mission, and they have all the tools they need in order to do it. The bigger the company, the more mission based teams you have, and the more specialized they are.Over the next few months, our one collective goal at Imgur is to “focus on the basics”. This means five specific things for us.Right from there we have five, temporary, mission based teams. Currently, objectives 1–4 have two full stack developers, one designer, and one PM. Unfortunately, our mobile teams are too small in order to do this yet, but soon, we’ll put mobile developers on those objectives too. In fact, no matter what we do in the future, we know that we will always have defining objectives that roll up to one main goal, and each defining objective is a opportunity for at least one mission team. Actually, each defining objective could easily have many of it’s own objectives that require mission based teams.At the end of this year our goal is to reach 90 people which come from the following teams: android, ios, frontend, backend, devops, sales, marketing, ad-ops, creatives, pr, design, product, analytics, machine learning, performance, community, support, legal, finance, accounting, hr, recruiting, partnerships, and administrative. Some of those teams are just one person, and some are a dozen people. Many are also cross-functional and form mission teams that focus on just one objective. And who knows, next week we may discover that weve overlooked a team and need to add one more, and a year from now we’ll definitely have many more teams. Some companies are so big that theyve grown teams specifically for the purpose of hooking up internal teams to other internal teams because they have a hard time keeping track of all of them.So you can see that if you setup the right structure and priorities, the company could easily grow to hundreds of employees composed of many small teams. It’s easy to wonder what people are for when you look at the company from the outside, or even within your own team. But when you look at it as a whole and in terms of teams instead of people, where each team is responsible for it’s own small mission, you realize that it’s actually pretty complex and can grow very large.Ive found that instability from growth comes in waves. All of a sudden you’ll find your old way of doing things isnt working anymore and your employees are pissed. So what do you do? You create a new process and you have lots of coffee dates! That’s what. And if you’re lucky, it will work. Then one or two months will go by and you find that people’s roles have shifted, you have people fitting in where they werent before, you have a new product, some new SaaS system, and another broken process that you just thought you fixed. Look on the bright side though, you probably have someone to fix it for you by now!I don’t know what waves we’ll go through, how many, or how often as we continue on with our destiny, but I’m looking forward to the change. Change is seen as a dirty word, but personally, I’m searching for it. “To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.” — founder  ceo of imgur, entrepreneur, programmer, gamer, animal lover

Its easy to understand that the people who get you from A to B, don’t always get you from B to C. But the second time around, you have to understand that the people who got you from B to C in the first company won’t always get you from A to B in the next one. Hire the right team for right now while being mindful of the necessity to scale. In the early days the team should be built for speed and execution, with the ability to handle ambiguity and uncertainty. Hiring people who need structure too early is a recipe for disaster. Hiring people who can’t handle structure later on will also be a disaster.Things don’t always go well in the beginning. Sometimes they take longer to materialize, sometimes you are flat out wrong in your assumptions, clients will cancel, competition will undermine you; no matter the situation you need people on the team who don’t get rattled. You need people who can take a punch, stay in the pocket and keep fighting. The best quote I’ve heard in a long time is by Paul Graham that “Startups don’t die from homicide, they die from suicide”Along with resiliency, optimism  curiosity are incredibly important traits all early employees must embody. The early days of a startup are about ideation, rapid iteration, and evolution. Granted, not every idea is a good idea but most ideas should lead to a discussion which should hopefully lead to solutions. In the early days of a startup, shooting down an idea without engaging in creative problem solving is like trying to navigate a city exclusively dead end streets.We learned this one the hard way a couple times. Its important to first define the values that comprise your belief system and then make it a point not to hire outside of these values. This is easier said than done because often times you may 1. think a candidate is good enough and can fill an immediate/pressing need, or 2. you find someone incredibly talented and are scared to pass up on the opportunity to raise the bar. If the person isnt a fit culturally, it usually won’t end well.It’s no surprise that there are so few people in this world you can trust; it’s the reminder that is usually the toughest part.A lot of my memories of my first company were after we had already gotten to a decent size and had significant market presence. Lots of people want to be your friend when you’re already big, but when you choose to start over, and you can’t do a lot for too many people then you see who your friends really are. Only a select few are actually going to go out of their way for you.Investors can add a lot of value but they get pulled in a bunch of directions and there’s also no replacement for building a great operational team. Lean on your investors but understand that they aren’t in the trenches with you. The biggest thing they can do in the early days in provide credibility, help with recruiting, and make some valuable introductions, its your job to take it from there.Doing things from a standing start are hard, you have limited resources and no momentum so you have to learn to maximize your output. Angel investors and advisory board members are often some of the most helpful people out there. It’s also an inexpensive way to extend your team. Some of the best intros (client and investor) we got were from our angels  advisors.In the early days, we knew that we needed to scale up on engineering so we wanted to create as strong of a network for outbound demand generation as possible. Leveraging our angels and advisory board, we were able to effectively build a sales force without having to commit capital to pay for one.Define what it will take for your company to be successful and build the team to solve for those things. In the early days we defined what it would take for us to succeed but we were in a rush to get to market. We outsourced two key initiatives that we ended up spending a lot of time and money on that we eventually overhauled once we had our key talent in place. The outsourced work looked ok at the time but it became obvious in short order that the work missed the mark and needed to be redone. Without bringing the initiatives in house, we would have been dead by now.This is one of those ones that usually surprises most people. The work never becomes easier and as you get older you have lots of distractions and forces pulling you in many directions outside of work. Once you have sold a company however, you do have far greater access to capital. This is important though because it allows you to sit at the table longer with a bigger stack of chips and ride out any early challenges or miscalculations as you try to find product market fit.As a second time entrepreneur, its easy to be your own toughest critic at times but don’t let that become a liability. The days are never long enough, the market is usually never excited enough, clients are never spending fast enough. Have faith in yourself and your team and learn to understand when you are doing a good job by tracking progress over time since launch, this will allow you to see all the progress you have made and give you perspective on how far you need to go.From Boston.

I was interviewed recently on the subject of startups vs agencies and it got me thinking. What are the main differences between the two and can they ever be brought together for a greater good? In the first of two parts, I shall look at how agencies can be more startup, before examining what startups can learn from agencies, in my next post.Startups and agencies are very different beasts and for good reason. But as technology drives more and more consumers in an ever connected world, can agencies become more startup in order to survive? The answer, in my opinion, is yes but not necessarily through Harrison left Profero but his next agency didn’t have the startup culture he craved.Harrison left to freelance before returning to startup world in 2010 when he founded Company culture is about core values and whilst most employees at early stage startups see their work as a Startups have a mission to create something meaningful; a product or service that translates long hours into disrupting an industry and serving its customers well. Agencies, on the hand hand tend to focus on pleasing the client, with little or no desire from individuals to innovate or push the boundaries of what is possible.It is also the responsibility and accountability distributed at startups which has a profound effect on culture — being able to directly contribute to the success of a business makes you work harder, and better, with a shared vision which is often lacking in big organisations where you’re working for someone else. As Harrison says,After eight years of working When Harrison looks back to the early days of Profero, he says:And when did you last hear an agency say that? “Until now that is.Thanks to Published in-Handpicked business, marketing, design, and technology articles for entrepreneurs and startups.

One morning in 2013, my wife suggested I quit my job and start the business I was always talking about — helping entrepreneurs tell their stories.“It’ll never work,” I said. “Founders don’t budget a line item for storytelling.”That same day, an investor friend of mine — who knew about my past life as a magazine journalist — emailed to ask if I could help one of his startups better tell their story — on their home page, to investors, to customers, and to potential new hires. Except that’s not how he put it.“We need strategic messaging and positioning guidance,” he wrote.Two years later, I make my living as an Acting CMO, and a big part of that is crafting strategic messaging and positioning for early-stage companies. Recently, I delivered strategic messaging assets to my 15th client company, so this seemed like a good moment to reflect and share a few lessons learned.If you’re thinking about high-level company and product messages — that is, stories — I hope you’ll find these five points useful.Great messaging makes an audience envision two possible futures: one positive (achieved through purchasing, signing up, or otherwise engaging), the other negative (the result of not buying, or choosing a competitor). So you have to make clear choices about who your audience is, what the future you’re promising them looks like, and how you’ll You know those people who, on a first date, attempt to win you over by listing every one of their selling points? That’s how some companies approach messaging. Of course, great editors will tell you that compelling stories are the result of figuring out what’s important and cutting the rest. One of my clients had been touting its charitable donations above all else, but even the founders admitted that few customers cared primarily about that. A big part of my job is helping leaders come to terms with de-prioritizing parts of their story — From the beginning, I’ve described the future that I offer to my own clients as “telling more effective stories to customers, investors, and potential new hires.” I’ve always believed in the “new hires” part, but recently a well-funded Series B company with A-list investors engaged me Yes, differentiation is crucial. However, prospects have to understand what you do before they’re ready to learn how you do it differently. One of my clients, not wanting to seem like all the other companies that do X, didn’t even mention X on its home page. Prospects would literally call the sales team and say, “I thought you guys did X, but guess I was wrong. Can you refer me to companies that do X?”I started my career as a programmer, and if you hired me today as your Rails guy, you could do worse. I used to think messaging was easier than coding, but after doing it so many times, I now believe the opposite. When your code’s not working, there’s usually a pretty clear path to finding out why. When your story’s not working, it’s a less-structured journey. Still, it’s reassuring to see that more and more companies are seeing value in finding a line item for it, even if it goes by other names.* * *Helping entrepreneurs tell strategic stories. Stories about telling company stories

What not to do as a first-time entrepreneur starting a company right out of college.After 5 months of toiling 14-hour days, making a hardware IoT product from scratch and spending thousands of dollars of Other People’s Money, I and my two co-founders woke up with a jolt.It suddenly dawned to us that our product would not sell. And unless we did something about it, the startup was doomed. This was December 2014.Dreamy eyed noobs that we were, we made tons of mistakes. I hope this post helps you avoid some of those mistakes because as much as we glorify failure in the startup world, it does hurt. A lot.Let me back-track a few months to give you some background. In July, we started building smart internet connected switches that learn from user behavior and automate all the electronic appliances in a home.We felt that it’s a pity that our search results and news feed are personalized to us but our homes, where we spend most of our time, are not.We had a vision that our switches will learn and personalize the electronic appliances in a home to its owner. We decided to name the company Lumos.(Yes, I am a big Harry Potter Fan!)We took some pre-seed investment from an angel investor and headed off to our alma mater IIT Gandhinagar to get incubated. We converted a lab into our office space and the Lumos saga started!We built like crazy. That’s the thing about us engineers; if you give us something interesting to build, we will forget everything else and just build. Our first prototype, which automated lights, was ready in 45 days.The second prototype, which could automate lights, fans, ACs and water heaters was out in another month. This is really fast according to hardware standards.In mid-November, we got a product designer on board to design the final product. In December, we were already in talks with investors to raise the next round of funding.We were on track to have a market-ready hardware product in less than one year. We were pleased with ourselves. The investors were pleased with us. Life was a bed of roses.Until it was not. We had underestimated the work that goes into making a market-ready hardware product. We had overestimated the demand and utility of our product.We were wildly wrong about the price at which we thought our product would sell. And when all this realization came together, shit got real.We were forced into a deathly spiral of pivots that almost killed the company. We made bigger mistakes. We left IoT as a sector. We lost a cofounder on the way. The pivots are a long story. I’ll save it for another day.Now that you have some background, here are the top 5 mistakes we made in Lumos and what we learnt from them.We had never used the existing home automation products in our homes. We were not experts in the IoT sector. When you have new at something, you give yourself the famous Dunning Kruger Pass on your decisions.“The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than is accurate.”And we did give ourselves the Dunning Kruger pass. Had we been users of existing smart switches, we would have known that the incremental value that our product was offering was quite low. Had we been experts in IoT, we would have known how to price hardware and the difficulties in building it.By avoiding this mistake, you can avoid a lot of other mistakes which happen as a result of this one.We did not understand the market and competition well enough. We also did not figure out the persona of our customer. And whether that customer was looking for the value that we were providing.We did not question whether we would be able to provide that value in that first place.(Machine Learning cannot read the human mind. Not yet!).It is always possible to validate or disvalidate a lot of assumptions about the product, market and competition without building the full-fledged product.One way we could have done it was by selling existing products to our potential customers.It was not that we were clueless about the problems in our product. We had doubts in our minds. In a startup, you almost always have doubts. But we had built so much. We were in love with our product. And we were not ready to ask the difficult questions.Is it okay to be doubtful about your product? Is it okay to voice your doubts and bring the team morale down?Or make your cofounders feel that you are not as committed to the idea and the vision as they are?It would have saved us a couple of months and some money.We were making switches that could automate your lights, fans, ACs and water heaters. We would have tried to automate your TV, Fridge, Oven and Car as well had it been feasible to do so.We were pitching power savings as well as luxury. This made the product and the pitch very complicated.Building a successful startup is hard. Building a hardware startup is 10 times harder.Pebble, with all its Kickstarter success, is still in troubled waters.Building a prototype is the easiest part of building a hardware startup. The real challenge comes in product design, production engineering, manufacturing, distribution and marketing/sales. And you need to have friends in China.Also, hardware product validation and iteration cycles are much longer than software ones. Getting funding is relatively difficult; VCs ask for traction(~$1M on Kickstarter/Indiegogo last I heard)because of the inherent risk in a hardware startup.Managing cash flows is hard because you have to pay your vendors months before you get paid from your customers.Considering all this, we were not the right team to build a hardware company.Eventually, we ended up leaving hardware and IoT and decided to build something that solves a problem that we had experienced.Since Gandhinagar(where Lumos was located) does not have many startups, interacting and sharing experiences with other entrepreneurs was always a big problem for us.Also, we had to subscribe to a lot of blogs (crowded inbox) just to stay updated with top content on Entrepreneurship.We decided to build FundaMine to solve this problem.Currently, FundaMine has communities(mines) on Entrepreneurship, Product Management, Android Dev and IoT.

In this record fundraising year, (and despite the recent hiccups, record year in the public markets) we are beginning to see a lot of companies raise institutional venture capital simply because it’s widely available and the Silicon Valley bull market default. Many people feel they have to take venture capital, or they get pushed into it by investors looking for opportunities. This is bad.Out of the approximatelyHanging out yesterday, a friend (in a leadership role at a startup) mentioned his Xoogler friends were hacking on something, and were probably going to raise money when they shouldn’t.Here’s a quick crack at that:Elon Musk put $100M of his own money into SpaceX before he raised $20M in “Series A” VC money from some of his former Paypal cofounders in 2008 (6 years of work and 3 progressively closer-to-successful launches into the company’s life). It wasn’t until 2009 that they received their first (relatively small) commercial contract. Even if a fund is of the billion-dollar scale, investing $120M in a single company to fund development over 7 years before basic technological and commercial de-risking is untenable in an area with weak intermediate outcomes. Who would buy SpaceX if it didn’t work?. However, if some of that risk is taken off the table, as it had been here by 2008, the investment and risk profile changes dramatically — and that investment looks like it will do enormously well for Founders Fund.Enterprise software and consumer internet investments have been the focus of many venture firms for a long time because of their potential to reach scale quickly with high capital efficiency. Certain dynamics are arguably making investments in other areas increasingly viable (for example, cheaper/faster to produce consumer hardware/electronics), but the expectations haven’t changed.VC’s (including myself) are often somewhat disappointed when they find out their smart, driven, dynamic friends are working on businesses that shouldn’t be venture backed. There are only so many talented people in the world. :( However, if that’s you, be flattered by that dynamic, answer these questions honestly for yourself, and don’t raise money just because it’s the default. Raise to empower and accelerate your mission.About a month ago, I was looking at investing in a young team who had built a beautiful, forward looking data product with some interesting technology and potentially wide applicability. I think there was opportunity to build a huge commercial business that has impact on many people. The team had raised (traditional, valley-style) seed capital. In parallel with their Series A fundraising process, 18 months into the life of the company, a tech giant made them an acquisition offer. We offered them terms, and they sold the company anyway. The founders got serious cash — at an acquisition price that doesn’t move the needle at all for Greylock, but is life changing for them. And that’s good. If I convince you not to sell your company but you don’t independently want to build the business, we’re out of alignment. Maybe that’s your first golden ticket, and in 2–4 years, we’ll work on your next company together.I met some talented technologists yesterday. They quit their jobs, they hired a few other people, they hacked together a cool product, they’re working on some contracts. Their technology is almost fully open source. They told me, we’re not necessarily interested in building this into a big business, we just want to hack on the technology. We raised some money from friends and family, we can get paid enough to do this as a lifestyle business and we don’t want the pressure of institutional investors to grow this or to figure out a commercial model. And that’s good. If I convince you to take money and you don’t independently want to build the business, we’re out of alignment.These kinds of stories will keep happening. But these stories are much better outcomes for everyone than finding out somewhere down the line that you and your backers are out of whack on what scale of organization you’re trying to build. Bringing a good venture partner on board means you’ll get someone who will support you, who will share your long term ambition, but will also push you to build both fast and big, and hold you regularly accountable to visible progress on that front. It’s a long term decision that will outlast the current euphoria in the fundraising markets.As long as you want that, and you do have that aligned ambition — it’s on!Published in-Always hunting.

If you still haven’t heard about it, Nevertheless, we must be doing something right. San Pedro Valley, or SPV as we call it, is famous for being the most developed startup ecosystem in Brazil and a key hub in Latin America. This is not our saying: the praise comes from It was early 2012 when I went to SPV’s first happy hour, San Pedro Cerva — “cerva” is a slang for beer. That’s where I had the chance to meet an incredible group of people trying to accomplish the very same things I were. I went home amazed, and really excited about it.Today there are more than 200 startups in the community and some of them are thriving on their markets and becoming leaders in Brazil and Latin America, including Back in the San Pedro Cerva episode, I met this guy called Luiz was involved in the initial development and design of the program. He has eventually left the initiative to go live in the US, but his ideas and initial contacts became the foundation to the program later created and named as SEED (Startups and Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Development).This description was taken from the The program benefits included up to US$40,000 dollars per team, an incredible office space, mentorship, training, workshops, and a wide network of entrepreneurs, partners and investors. Equity free.And the whole thing was really well executed. All the main stakeholders of the ecosystem were involved in its conception, including the entrepreneurs themselves. Government reps, mentors, investors, and entrepreneurs were all working with the same objective: to promote and develop startups and innovation in the country.I never participated in the program as an accelerated startup, but I had countless chances to engage with it, starting from being a host for a foreign startup — yes, all the foreign teams were hosted by a local entrepreneur so they had a warm reception and felt like they were home. I even picked up a group at the airport the first time they landed in Belo Horizonte.And of course it was not just me. I would certainly say that all founders living in Belo Horizonte have visited the space at least once. The office was open to anyone, either to host an event or even use a desk/internet connection for a couple of hours or days, no matter if you were an accelerated startup or not.The SEED space gradually became the obvious place to go in San Pedro Valley. Suddenly we all had a place for meetings, happy hours, meetups, startup weekends and whatever came to our crazy minds. It was great for early-stage startups that didn’t have an office yet, but also good for the ones that already had. It was not just about the space — it was a home for the community.The program was created in 2013 by Governor Antonio Anastasia, through an institution called A lot of people were involved in the conception of the program, but I really need to specially mention The program was internationally known and considered one of the most important entrepreneurship development initiatives in Brazil.SEED was responsible for bringing to life 73 companies from 12 different countries that together had R$ 23 million in revenue until the end of 2014, created 145 jobs and raised R$ 10 million from private funds. Plus they influenced the life of 17,000+ people in 55 cities, considering most founders used to mentor and teach kids and young students on low-income communities.The program was created by the government, so it’s really hard not to relate it to politics of any kind… but it’s important to notice that it was never mentioned or marketered as an initiative from a specific politician or party — specially when it came to take decisions about the structure, operations or investments.SEED was initialy led by Governor Anastasia, one of the leaders of the PSDB party (The program began to be questionated and re-evaluated in the beginning of 2015, since the new Governor Fernando Pimentel has been elected. He’s part of the PT party (The Secretary of State of Economic Development has denied that the program is in risk to be shut down, and this re-evaluation is part of a broader assessment being done by the new government for all the initiatives and public politics created by the last government.But that’s not really what it looks like. Entrepreneurs were surprised by the fact that the office has been suddenly closed, leaving startups without a place to work — even those who came from outside the country or the state. Plus, the original contacts the SPV community had in the government have been exonerated right before the office.Government says that the closing is temporary, but there are no guarantees that the program will ever come back to life in the same place or the same format. The rental contract of the coworking space itself will be ended by April 1st, and the SEED HQ will not be reinstated there.Rejane Martins, part of the original SEED staff has posted on the group’s official Facebook profile the following statement:Even the program Board members were unaware of the office closing and the future of the program. Yuri Gitahy, one of the most respected angel investors in Brazil and part of our community, has posted a series of tweets in Yuri also said it was not a formal resignation, since there’s not even an entity or person in charge of the program to inform his decision.Presently and suddenly, SEED has no funds, no staff and no office.It’s important to notice that the cost of a State Deputy in Brazil — including his salary, massive benefits, budget for 25 cabinet employees — is close to R$ 2M per year. This is pretty close to the cost to of accelerating a batch of 40 startups in the program. Got it? The cost of one Deputy could fund and host an entire SEED batch for six months.It gets worse. Earlier this year, the government has approved a 40% salary/benefits raise for deputies — obviously, they think it’s better to make politicians even richer than investing a tiny fraction of that budget in innovation, i.e. two yearly SEED batches.From the outside, what we see is a clear party dispute where people discard a huge amount of effort/cash/work so they won’t keep initiatives created by the previous administration. They just can’t admit that other parties or politicians did a good job. It’s not a matter of doing what’s good for the country and for the people, but to make sure you can get the proper visibility and political advantages from a perfect program already approved by society — just kill it and rebuild as “yours”.In the end of the day, the country loses.Many entrepreneurs have manifested their reactions to SEED’s HQ closing. The general consensus is that we will do everything we can to keep the program legacy alive.San Pedro Valley existed long before SEED, and will keep existing after it’s gone — welcoming new friends made through this wonderful program.Our community will remain strong and promoting entrepreneurship — apart from politics. Our beliefs are solid, and we will keep developing entrepreneurs for the future of Brazil.B2B Internet entrepeneur.

BY It’s trendy these days for bright young start-up founders to talk proudly about the mistakes, losses and failures they’ve had along their road to success. I can see the appeal in reading those stories — it makes your own eventual vindication seem all the more likely. When you see someone who has raised X amount of dollars shining a light on all their false starts and shitty decisions, it can be comforting.By many people’s standards, I haven’t achieved the necessary success for that post yet. I’m not a visionary, or a CEO. I’m a failed musician, a co-founder who quit and a dreamer who has never been good at keeping his feet on the ground. I have battled with the crushing weight of failure and depression and I’ve given up more times than I should have. For me, that’s not a badge of honour. It’s just a part of my history.I’m very susceptible to others’ energy and enthusiasm. Being a pretty quiet, often cautious person myself, when I come across someone who is alive and kicking I can become very quickly caught up in their excitement.When I started my first business, a music management company that was running out of a recording studio in downtown Sydney, I had a co-founder who was full of energy. He was going to turn our acts into superstars, and his enthusiasm carried me and blinded me to the problems inherent in our business. It also blinded me to the shady deals that were going on and the people who were being ripped off.When the business folded and I was left with a heavy debt and a bad credit rating, that second hand energy evaporated and I recognised him for what he was. A crooked businessman who was using me to hide his crooked deals. I walked away from that with a newfound sense of bitterness and cynicism that hasn’t necessarily been healthy for me. But it’s come with a good deal more wisdom too.I used to be prepared to screw people over. That makes me a bad person.I was ready to put my own needs and wants before anyone else in business in order to reach my goals, and that led to a lot of people being hurt. When I was in music management, there were bands that I should have been managing that lost money and lost opportunities because I took what I needed from them instead of asking how I could help them. There were people involved with my first tech start-up who were unceremoniously pushed out of the equation when the time came to divide shares.I made the call to fire those people who I deemed inessential without worrying about them as people.It was selfish. And I felt like crap about it. Don’t screw anyone over — even if it works out for you, it won’t feel worth it.In my time, I’ve gone from running a music company to co-founding a software start-up to running a consulting business. I spent a good 6 months working part time in a child-care centre while I wrote experimental dance music and annoyed the hell out of my eternally patient partner. And I’ve never reached my full potential with any of those projects because half way through I got bored and walked away.Lacking commitment means that you’re never fully invested in what you’re doing. Sometimes it can mean you don’t even care about what you’re doing, you just care about the person it will make you. You can’t spend your time second guessing what is or isn’t the right path for you to follow.It’s something I’ve only learned as I’ve grown older and gained more experience. But now that I’m 26 it definitely feels like something I should have picked up a while back. When you find a project that you love working on, the best thing you can do is focus on it, commit and follow through. Anything less than that only leads to one outcome — failing. And writing blog posts about it.I came close to losing my girlfriend when I joined a social media start-up as their content marketing manager. What a shitty trade-off that would have been, losing someone I love dearly in exchange for stock options and a pretty meagre salary. I would be late to meet her because I’d be caught up at the office. And I’m not talking a square half-hour late with an apologetic “I’m running late” phone call, I’m talking 2 hours late on Valentine’s Day without so much as a text.Can you believe she didn’t break up with me?To this day, I can’t think of a reason why she stood by me. But I’m glad she did.I went from managing a music business and throwing parties for celebrities to leading a software team to applying for a fast-food service job in 18 months. That’s a steep, stark and overall quite shitty fall from grace. When you’re filling out the on-line form that asks why you want to join the McDonalds’ team in place of building something you thought would last for decades, it’s not an ideal situation.But I was out of cash and out of time and the bills wouldn’t wait. I still had big ideas (don’t we all) but without a source of income I just couldn’t make those ideas a reality.I ended up working my ass off at a bunch of service jobs while I plotted out my next steps, and it was hard. But I did it, and I got through it. You have to just run with whatever you can to get by and keep your head above water. Don’t be precious about it.Writing about creativity, tech and business.

By Christina WallaceBusiness Insider recently published a piece on the dark side of founderism that is rarely discussed: Good. We need to talk about this.But every story, every quote, every example in the piece is of a man (and almost exclusively white men). Writer Biz Carson cites three tragic suicides: But she did no interviews with female founders about how they deal with depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. No mention of Y Combinator-backed This is a problem. This is not a story that can or should be told exclusively through the experience of white men. No story in the world of tech and entrepreneurship should be, of course, but particularly with respect to mental health we are leaving out huge, important swaths of the experience when we exclude women and people of color. The public good requires that we talk about it — and that we talk about all of it.This is not about quotas or tokenism, it’s about reality — and accuracy. Carson includes a quote from Ben Huh, founder of Cheezburger:This is problematic. The notion that a CEO is a “strong, tough male figure who acts masculine and doesn’t ask for help or assistance.” This archetype is helping no one. It’s not helping anyone who isn’t a “strong, tough male figure” — like a woman, or a man who doesn’t identify as “strong” or “tough” — but it’s also not helping men who DO identify as strong and tough.One way to break this entrenched ideal is to be aware of the voices we amplify and the stories we highlight to ensure a multiplicity of models is visible. (This is why the Another is to take our mental health as seriously as we take our physical health. In a community that embraces The Business Insider article reveals some astounding facts: Even more surprising: the vast majority of founders (72%) is facing some kind of mental health issue or has a family history of one — making them more prone to develop one at some point.Not included in the piece are two other relevant stats: while men are more likely to commit suicide, women are 3x I applaud Carson for starting this conversation, but she missed a real opportunity to blow this myth off of its pedestal.So I’m going to give it a shot.I’m not a reporter, nor a mental health expert. I am a founder, based in New York’s tech community, who had a venture-backed startup that failed. My co-founder and I didn’t have a soft landing or a quiet fade into the acquihire sunset; we flat-out failed with a bang — which garnered us a gleefully written company When my startup, Quincy, was on the brink I fell into a funk. I don’t know if it was a true, clinical case of depression. I didn’t see a professional during that period so I have no way to know. What I do know is that I crawled into bed and didn’t leave for three weeks. I didn’t talk to anyone. I didn’t leave my bed, except to answer the door when the occasional Seamless delivery arrived. I watched all seven seasons of The West Wing top to bottom and I sobbed.I mourned the end of my company. I also mourned the death of the grandmother who raised me, which had occurred just three weeks prior. And — if we’re being totally honest here — I was mourning the end of my relationship with my co-founder and friend (though happily that turned out to be only temporary).But the end of my company wasn’t the first time I’d felt this way. There were so many moments throughout the nearly two years that we built Quincy where I cried myself to sleep. I had friends to talk with — fellow founders to commiserate with, grad school friends who took me to dinner and were kind enough to pick up the check, and exes who were still friendly enough to take a call and talk me off a proverbial ledge.But as In Your Corner’s Bea Arthur told me, “She should know — she has a dual masters in clinical psychology and counseling from Columbia University. That’s why she founded In Your Corner — a platform for video calls with licensed therapists and certified coaches. (Full disclosure: I am a client and love it.)The other side of taking mental health seriously is puncturing the perception that founders aren’t human; that startups aren’t emotional rollercoasters; and that the only possible response to “How are things going?” is “We’re crushing it!”I asked her if she ever had issues with partners or investors (or even employees) because of how transparent she is about her rollercoaster. I know I often felt the pressure to keep up the façade of success because I didn’t want to worry my team or give off the impression that I couldn’t handle it.Cindy was pointed in her response to that query: “If you find this [transparency] problematic, you’re not my kind of investor / partner. I’m not trying to put up a façade or maintain a cheery face; my life building a Writer and founder Lizzie Skurnick took an even more radical approach to transparency with her post for Dame Magazine on her choice to take She also makes a strong case for seeking mental health resources before the point that you need to employ them. Everyone should “have access to therapeutic check-ins — especially because, as any depressive can tell you, the worst time to find a doctor is in the throes of a depressive episode.”But not every female founder feels comfortable enough to be so open. Allyson Downey, founder of Techstars-backed WeeSpring, understands the pressure: “I’d argue it is harder for a woman to ask for help because we’re already operating at a disadvantage: [the] perception that women aren’t as qualified / competent / level as men.” There is also added stress from being a female founder with kids, with the ever-looming charge that maybe she just can’t handle it all. “I feel like I need to be But an inauthentic projection of success can lead to even stronger internalization of failure. Cindy Gallop understands that well. “Stress arises when you are not able to be who you are and you’re forced to adopt a different persona / approach that isn’t yours. So I find I am able to handle stress much more effectively when I can be open and honest about just how much of it I’m under.”The more we can welcome a panoply of models for what a successful founder looks like, the more each founder can approach their work in a way that is authentic and honest to who they are.

I work for a young startup that helps other startups grow and thrive (I know…almost too meta to be contained by these parentheses). We’ve spent a lot of time deep in the weeds over the past few months helping various companies and entrepreneurs to scale and organize, and a funny thing happened–we forgot to grow ourselves.We wanted to learn from the best, so we approached the top growth hackers in the industry to train our team to think like experts and super-charge our customer acquisition efforts. Some experts gave pretty controversial advice while others cited more time-tested methods. There was a fair mixture of bootstrapping and free tools with paid acquisition and powerful management systems. But every single piece of information was invaluable.We came to the very exciting and very nerve wracking point in the startup journey when you’ve hammered out product, you have your processes up and running, and you need fuel for your fire. We had been stockpiling fuel for months, and it was time to use it.We reached out to growth wizard We did our homework, which is why the experts listed above are the cream of the crop. What we came away with was a collection of techniques, insight into best practices, and a better understanding of the kind of mindset you need to help your company experience explosive growth. Many of these techniques and ideas don’t get as much attention amidst the plethora of growth hacking articles trending out on the web right now, but they just might be the missing piece you need to build an unstoppable growth engine.Let’s begin!Being data-driven is great. It’s one of the fundamental practices of good growth hacking. I bet you already have a spreadsheet or a dashboard where you track growth experiments each week (you do, right?) But just looking at the numbers, or even optimizing your numbers, isn’t the whole story. You need to be aware of the underlying assumptions you are making with each experiment, and how the outcome validates, invalidates, or doesn’t address them.Creating a clear hypothesis that you consistently, rigorously document for every growth activity will be the difference between getting smarter with each attempt and wasting your time. Growth hacking is about learning from your successes and your failures, not about simple numbers-chasing or vanity metrics (but really, follow us on Most startups dream of reaching mass appeal, getting hundreds of thousands of users, and ultimately changing the world. The worst way of capturing a large audience, however, is casting a wide net. The most efficient and effective way to get a mass market foothold is to conquer and prove yourself in a tiny community. This logic is more complex than just finding your ‘target market.’ There are some really undervalued ways that specific communities will help your startup succeed, especially when it comes to growth, and a lot of it comes down to efficiency.First of all, it’s much easier to go viral in a dense and passionate group of people. Find a local network of enthusiastic and active moms or a group of gamers who are obsessed with one particular game. These users are part of communities that are much more active, communicative, interested, and reachable than both the general public and a whitewashed target market. Through these groups, you can create laser-focused target messaging and gather really specific feedback to better optimize your product.Our favorite quote from interviewing Morgan Brown was, ‘If you fail 7 out of 10 times at the plate, you’re still going to the hall of fame.” Baseball references aside, the message is the same: good growth hackers are still failing MOST OF THE TIME.That’s why you need to be clear about what you are learning with each growth attempt and why hypotheses are key. When we first started our experiments, our team got frustrated pretty quickly. Things just weren’t catching on the way we’d hoped. But when we dug deeper, we realized we hadn’t optimized each experiment to truly represent and address our goals and hypothesis. So, while failure stung, our team’s ability to realize this shortcoming and adapt to it made the difference between a humbling learning experience and the painful, long-term failure it could have been.If user acquisition was easy, the majority of startups wouldn’t fail. You would know right away whether your idea was good or bad. It’s important that you and your team (and especially your company leaders) get what happens when you growth hack. Make sure that everyone is involved and that everyone sees the results. Make sure the whole team feels accountable. Get ready to fail a lot, but make sure it’s an experience that makes you more clever and gives you real insight. Draw conclusions, make assumptions, test, document, and evaluate. It’s okay to get knocked down over and over–in fact, we recommend it–as long as you’re not getting knocked down by the same thing every time. Learn from your failures and then get smarter.When you finally reach some kind of viral success, it won’t be because you A/B tested your way into the most efficient referral program, or optimized your landing pages. It will be because you motivated your customers in a way that fits gracefully into their personal narrative. If that sounds lofty, that’s because it is.The most successful growth companies understand the reason why their customers are there in the first place and use that as a logical framework to build virality into the product. You can’t tack on a generic referral program and expect results.Please optimize. Please A/B test. You’d be surprised at how changing button placement, size, or color will drive results. But they aren’t going to carry your company. Startups that skyrocket do so because growth is baked into their product and meets the customer where they’re at.At the end of the day, even with lots of experimentation and the best intentions, you will have a staggering pile of failures. That pile will get higher with each sprint cycle and each growth team meeting. But nothing feels better than watching your sign-ups increase, or your email list swell with eager customers. Growth is both art and science–but whatever angle you approach it from, know that it is a team sport. Communicate. Document. Test. Grow. Now, go forth and revamp your approach, or pass this on to someone who can use it!P.S.

The 5 things I focused on in college on before I started Over the past two years I have forced myself to write on a regular basis. It’s done wonders for nearly every part of my life.When you leave little room for misunderstanding, most things simplify. That’s the beauty of clear communication.Don’t worry: If you want to become a better communicator, you don’t even have to publish anything — but if you want to become a better communicator you need to practice. You don’t even have to write original content: I’ve found a ton of value in re-writing old-school sales letters to force myself to try and think how they think.If I had to boil down what makes a good communicator in a couple of words here what I’d say:Being able to communicate is a fundamental to master before you start your startup — regardless of whether you’re “technical or nontechnical”.Fuck “Telling doesn’t do anything for the person you’re talking to (unless your demonstrating that your a great communicator, in which you’re actually just showing).Don’t tell me you’re “good with social media” when I can go to your twitter account and see that you haven’t used it a two weeks.People “tell” what they’re good at because it allows them to vague enough to explain how they’re good at something without giving any tangible examples.If you’re going to start a startup, you’re going to have real skills that are going to allow you to make your company great. It also allows you to find cofounders that are also great at what they do.It makes me cringe every time I get an email “help me find a technical cofounder” because I don’t feel comfortable referring you in a business perspective if you haven’t even take time to develop your own skills.I’ve found the best way to do that is by doing side project after side project.Do yourself a favor and get in the habit of showing, not telling. Develop tangible, valuable skills and you’ll attract other great people to startup your company with.While this is something that is difficult to develop, I thought it was just too important to not include.Self awareness allows you to close your feedback loop of self improvement to nearly instantly. Being able to recognize where you need work or have strength is crucial.Gary Vaynerchuk says it best so I’ll let him do the honor:Grit. Determination. Reltentlessly resourceful. The common song of what makes a great founder is not a misnomer.The market doesn’t care about the fact that you’re a student, also have a part time job, or the fact that you might have 10k worth of debt.You’re not going to get a handicap from the market. Everyone has their problems and you need to overcome yours.If you want to become a founder, make sure you never find yourself making excuses. The best founders make things happen no matter what the circumstances are, no matter how “unfair” things mights seem.Surround yourself with people that aren’t going to cover feedback in a bunch of BS and tell it to you like it is. If you don’t make a habit of sucking it up now, how do you think you’re going to make it through the 5–10 year grind of starting a company?Being a great startup founder requires a high level of performance all the time. Especially if you’re a founder, you’re going to have to lead by example.The top players in the game, again, seem to describe the best entrepreneurs in a consistent way: high-performing.While a lot of this is you being self-aware ;) in how you work best this is what I’ve found helpful to focus on:Always remember: exceptional people acted exceptional long before they were considered so.-A healthy mix of nerd, sexy, coffee, and ambition.

One of the best quotes I’ve heard in a long time was from Of course he was referring to his company Basecamp, which was a startup 15 years ago but today is not.When I set out back in April to build my next company, I realized I had no idea where to start in terms of getting it off the ground. Much like Jason, I hadn’t built a startup for a long time — since 2009 with Bigcommerce.During my time there as co-founder, I’d moved from engineer/product manager/marketer/CEO (2009) to “real” CEO (2010–2014) to board member (currently) and by the time I left I was used to spending most of my time on strategy and hiring.To say it was night and day going from a team of 500 to a team of 1 (me), is an understatement. I realized I had to learn the whole “how to build a startup” thing from scratch.The good news is that while building Bigcommerce, I probably made every mistake you could make:The good news is that you generally only make these mistakes a few times. Then you learn from them and move on.While I needed to re-learn a lot of the early stage stuff (hiring employee #1, for example — One of my friends and mentors I knew a lot about the problem I wanted to solve — after all, I’d experienced it first hand for years. All of the founders I asked also experienced it, so I was able to articulate the problem, which helped me form the entry point for how I wanted to go about solving it.The interesting thing about the problem is that it’s broad — and there are many ways to define it, so I decided to spend a few months building a “throw away product” instrumented using Intercom and backed up with a lot of customer interviews to see what would stick.Note: I realize this approach is not for everyone — more on that below.There were 3 features (really they were each products in their own right) I wanted to test, so I hired a team and we started building them. I wrote the specs and designed the wireframes while they made it beautiful and functional. I also spent a heap of time using guerilla marketing (Slideshare, promoted tweets, blogging, etc) to attract a couple hundred beta testers.This goes against the conventional wisdom of building an MVP, but the insights you get from seeing people use your product in the “real world” are much more valuable than what they tell you before you’ve built the product.Humans are emotional creatures, not rational ones, and feedback where they have a vested interest in the outcome is all I wanted. During my career I’ve found that people really don’t care about products you’re “going to build”. They care about solving a problem. Right now.Once we’d built the first iteration of our product (containing all 3 features), we set it loose on the beta testers. I got each of them on the phone (I made about 200 phone calls over 30 days and tried to be selective about which companies I invited to participate), walked them through the product and then got them up and running.Once we had a sufficient number of companies on the beta, I spent a lot of time doing two things:Based on the data and their feedback, one of the three features we’d built was doing better than the others in terms of engagement.I decided to pivot our “throw away” product to focus just on that feature and go deeper with more capabilities, streamlining the user interface, etc.We’d now simplified the product down to a single use case and essentially a single (but broad) feature.Again, I got on the phone with all of the companies on the beta, told them what was coming and showed them how it worked.After a few weeks of usage and a few dozen phone calls, it was becoming clearer that the product most definitely solved a problem, but it turns out it didn’t solve a tier one problem. For most of them, it solved a tier two problem.There was a glimmer of hope though — one of the features in the first iteration of the product also had good engagement and initially a lot of the beta companies were asking us to expand that feature and give it more depth. Initially I decided not to, but kept lots of detailed notes based on their feedback and knew it was another potential direction we could take.Now seemed like the right time to revisit that option, which is what we did next. Thank god I took notes like a mad man in Evernote during those customer interviews.By this point we were 3 months in and the team was now 6 people. I knew we were on to something and I felt confident this final attempt would prove me right and be something we could actually sell.Based on feedback from the beta companies as well as engagement and usage metrics I pulled from our Intercom database, I decided to Early feedback showed this feature had legs, but because there was no quantifiable way to determine whether it solved a tier 1 problem, I went back to the drawing board.We made some changes to the way the feature worked (more about this in our launch post next week — It turns out reporting was the missing piece of the puzzle.Companies (and their employees) used this particular feature like crazy in the first attempt of our product, but because it was missing detailed analytics, the CEOs and managers in these companies didn’t really know whether the product was making an impact — they “felt” it was, but of course unless you can prove something then you’re wasting your time.After a few 2 week sprints with the team, we’d built some really killer reporting and analytics that proved the value of the product and without question, demonstrated to CEOs and managers at the beta companies that the product was in fact solving the tier 1 problem we’d hoped to solve.Phew.At this point I validated that we had, in fact, achieved product-market fit using a process similar to the one Sean Ellis describes The final step was to polish things up and focus on the user experience before the launch.Now that we had a product which solved a tier 1 problem, I turned my attention to the user experience. The bar is set so high today in regards to usability and design, so I knew we had to really spend a lot of time making sure the first impression you get when you used the product was overwhelmingly positive.I broke the user experience down into a few things:I’ll talk about each item below.We’re well beyond the infant years of SaaS. A beautiful visual design coupled with a strong brand and simple UI is table stakes in 2015.I spent a lot of time here on two things:I’m not a good designer but I know good design when I see it, so I did my best to provide a compelling vision to both the agency and our visual designer and they got to work.After a few weeks and lots of great conversation and iterations, we had a beautiful brand that Our visual designer and front-end engineers also did a killer job building the look and product experience around the brand.There are two key personas for us — managers (CEOs, VPs, directors, etc — anyone who leads people at their job) and employees (let’s be honest, they do all the great work).We first mapped out the typical usage funnels for each persona based on the data we had available in Intercom as well as from customer interviews. We started to understand what slowed them down, where we had too many clicks, where we needed to add help text, etc.This is an ongoing focus for us, so I won’t talk too much more about it — but I felt it was important to invest some time here before we launched.You only get to make one first impression.In a perfect world your product is so easy to use, you don’t need an onboarding or getting started guide.In reality, that’s never the case. Even the iPhone has a multi-step onboarding process for new users now.We decided to take the “subtract” approach to onboarding, which means we looked at the usage funnels for each persona, tried to eliminate anything that took them too much time and then came up with no more than 3 things each persona needed to do to use the product successfully.We then paired those 3 things down to 2 (for managers) and 0 (for employees) after careful refinement and consideration for what we initially assumed were “must do” tasks versus stuff they could do later without negatively impacting their perception of our product.We ended up making our onboarding (for managers) 3 steps. The first step was already marked as done (a massive psychological trigger to complete the other 2 steps), so you really only had 2 things to do.This is the second most important part of the conversion funnel (the most important is visitor - trial), so I spent a lot of time working on the experience, initially myself via wireframes and then with our visual designer and front-end engineer on the design and interactions.We’re using Stripe which abstracts a lot of the payment logic, but I wanted people to be able to go from trial to paid in no more than 3 clicks.Using Stripe meant we just needed to ask for their credit card number, expiry date and CCV, so we eliminated a heap of friction here — their first name, last name, address, zip, country, etc.We also spent a lot of time focusing on clearly showing human-readable error messages if the payment failed. This is a pet peeve of mine and even when your payment failed, I wanted us to try and delight you with a clear, simple reason — so you could try again without closing your browser.Another thing that’s table stakes in 2015. We invested a lot of time not just creating a useable experience on phones and tablets, but an enjoyable one.I think the most important thing we did was build a responsive product from day one. That way, all wireframes, Invision prototypes, etc were designed mobile-first (well OK, not all — most) which made it a lot easier to build.We also focused a lot of time on performance — both real and perceived.I’ll always remember when Kevin Systrom (Instagram founder) said that perceived speed is more important than actual speed and talked about how Instagram tells you your photo is uploaded while it’s still actually uploading in the background.Perception becomes reality.I also didn’t want us to rebuild the entire product 3 months after launch, so building everything responsively took a bit more time up front but I believe it was a worthwhile investment.Nir Eyal’s amazing book Driving ongoing engagement via a series of well-timed, event-driven messages is something I really wanted to get right from the beginning.We spent some brain cycles thinking about the actions we wanted to influence, which would help our users extract maximum value from the product for the smallest amount of work and we ended up creating just 3 primary hooks using Mandrill for some and Intercom for others.Initially we’re using email to push out the messages and create the hooks, but Slack and other communication tools are on our roadmap too.The best form of support is not needing to reach out to get support, but getting your product to that point takes time.We decided to focus on a few things and tried to do them really well:Well, we’re getting all of our ducks in a row for our launch in the next week or two. That means we’re knocking out a few remaining bugs, finalizing our launch plan, tweaking the copy on our marketing web site, etc.I wrote our launch post this morning. It’s sitting in Medium ready for me to hit “publish” on, so that will be a defining moment for us next week.In the meantime, it’s been such a fun and challenging 7 months since we started this journey. Not only is our team full of hard working and smart people, but I feel like we’ve built a product that can legitimately help companies grow faster and have an amazing culture, which was why I was attracted to solving this problem in the first place.If you manage people as part of your job and would like to know when we launch, you can 

There’s a great show called Mastercrafts is all about — surprise! — master crafts:Trades we barely even think about today; obsolete, cottage industries.Nevertheless, there are still people who dream of learning these trades, and that’s where Mastercrafts comes in. Each episode follows the trials  triumphs of 3 would-be students during an intense 6-week course at the hands of a master craftsman.I’ve watched the series twice, and loved it both times. Because it turns out that learning to work iron and weave by hand are perfect corollaries to founding a startup.Whoever cast the shows did a fantastic job. Each episode features a great mix of student personalities. And because it’s a kind of reality show — although a very refined, smoking-jacket-wearing reality show — those personalities are brought to the fore. All the while the students are shaping stone, hanging thatch, cutting class, spinning wood on a foot-operated lathe in a tent, or hammering hot iron, they’re being aggressively human. We see their best sides… and their worst.Here are some of the personality flaws I’ve spotted:Several students in different episodes are Others Several more Several show a great deal of Others engage in I’m sure I’m making the show sound like a kind of horror parade of bitchiness, but nothing could be further from the truth! They find themselves achieving extraordinary things… just as soon as they decide to get over their crap.This transformation is wonderful to watch. It’s LIFE.And because it’s life — because, if you watch it, you’ll recognize your coworkers, your friends, and probably yourself — we can’t help but ask…This is something I’ve spent half a lifetime pondering. Here’s my conclusion, in progress.Until now, they’ve always worked for approval, abstracted from results: the question has always been, It’s as if Galileo dropped his ball and feather from the top of the tower and, as they fell, sought to convince his audience by argument This is the way most of us grow up to live, learn, and work. And it’s toxic.Have you ever engaged with a truly spoiled child?It’s tempting to think of spoiled children as cold, calculating brats, calmly deploying tantrums as tools of manipulation. But if you’ve ever And a coddled child literally can’t cope when his excuses don’t work.When the world fails to deliver the expected result to a spoiled child, or a coddled child, they feel like their world is ending. Their egos react accordingly, to force external change, to protect their mental model of the universe.When you live and work in an insulated life — divorced from the end result of your work — Stone doesn’t care if you’ve had a hard day. Iron won’t stay hotter longer just because you’re feeling hesitant with the hammer. If you don’t get your thatch right, it will leak, and that’s that. There’s no room for error.It must feel terrifying.In theory, yes. But in reality? Not These masters know the score. They know they serve reality and no higher authority. They know reality can’t be denied. Whether that reality is the one where the fabric is flawed, the stone doesn’t measure level, the chair breaks, or the client won’t pay… their feelings don’t matter, their excuses won’t hold, and no amount of belief in their unique value will change that.As the master blacksmith said, when the customer asks for “10 more of these” they’re going to be bloody upset when you come back with a newer, creative design and say “But this was more fun to make.” And then you don’t get paid.That’s what happens when these abstracted people arrive in the workshops of the master craftswoman on Day 1, thinking,The answer, of course, is Mastering a craft is HARD. It’s HARD, and their spoiled little inner brats thought it’d be easy. No wonder they rebel. No wonder they indulge their “perfectionism” or chafe bitterly at It’s this same attitude which leads you to abandon your project at the first sign of trouble. The same attitude which causes you to noodle endlessly on features. To delay marketing; to believe that if you build it, they will come. Or, hell, to ever build it or ship it at all. To seek feedback from your peers instead of your customers… to spend more time catering to venture capitalists than the people who’ll pay for your product. To lavish your energy on “innovating” instead of mastering the basics.Infinitely more endeavors have failed due to childish misbehavior than due to the market, the economy, the customers, or the competition.Don’t work on the basics every day? You’ll fail.Don’t market constantly? You’ll fail.Don’t solve your customer’s pains? You’ll fail.Don’t ship? Ha!There you go: business in four sentences.You’ll make things with your hands and your brain that will help people, people you get to meet, to talk to, to learn from. And you will feel rewarded.That is the decision you’ll face every day:Do you have what it takes to become a master craftsman?The philosophy and practice of craftsmanship doesn’t come out of nowhere — it comes from being around the right people, learning the right things, in the right environment, and practice, practice, practice. -Designer, developer, bootstrapper.Handpicked business, marketing, design, and technology articles for entrepreneurs and startups.

About once a day we get a pitch related to cell phone charging, drones, 3D printing, or robots that teach kids how to code. This is probably because people tend to start companies around problems they’re comfortable with. People see media hype as validation that these are good problems to work on. Sometimes they’re right, but just because a problem is widely talked about and somewhat painful doesn’t mean it’s a good place to start a business. We all need to eat and lots of people hate cooking, but starting a restaurant isn’t a good way to make money. Competitive markets destroy profits.If you work on problems you personally understand, there’s a higher likelihood of building something people actually want. However, average startup teams focusing on average problems should expect the average outcome: going out of business.If you’re in the younger startup demographic (recently out of college without years of industry experience) do you really have unique insight or is it just Like most investors, we’re primarily looking for great teams working in markets that are a good fit with the VC model, but there are a few areas we feel are underrepresented in the hardware startup space. Our hope is that founders already working in these areas reach out. We would love to see more founders working on:And if you’re NOT working in any of the categories you should reach out anyway!

Most music startups are built to target one of two markets: musicians or fans. This post discusses the concerns I have about the potential and viability of targeting musicians. It’s of course just my opinion, based on my experience.So what is my experience? I’ve gone from music fan to music exec to music startup CEO. I’ve experienced the industry from a bunch of different angles.Over 10 years ago, after a childhood of loving music, I started working in the music industry. I started by organizing and running a 3-After college, I worked for a At the same time, I was starting my I’ve also written for one of the most prominent music blogs. Coming from the music industry naturally led me to build companies where musicians (and their teams) would be my customers.In general, there are two revenue models to consider when building for musicians: charge them to use a tool or help them generate revenue and take a percentage as a fee.Unfortunately, the businesses your customers run put them in a position that makes it very hard for them to spend money on services.New musicians don’t have the money to pay for non-critical things. Their money must be spent on touring, gear, food, and shelter. And unless using your tool Established (read: signed) musicians also wont pay you. Actually, it’s their record labels who won’t, because even though the musician seems to be doing well, your customer is no longer the band, it’s the label. And record labels have an unenviable business model right now. It’s hard to get them to agree to pay for anything, and since it’s most likely an unpaid intern who’s using your tool, they won’t be the one making the purchase decision.Unless you have created something that’s truly revolutionary, Exceptions to this rule are services musicians need: Okay, so you can’t charge them. Instead, you’ll help them make money (by selling their music/merch online, creating a digital fan club, etc…) and just ask for a small cut. This model has its share of problems too.First off, smaller bands don’t make enough money for the cut you take to turn your startup into a meaningful business. And volume isn’t an option because trying to make money from the long tail has rarely worked. Again, there are edge cases (What about bands who make a lot of money on their own? Asking for a cut from them also has its problems. Generally, if the musician is established, it’s because they’ve built their own audience. They don’t want to share that money with you. They’ll talk your rate down to a point where your margins no longer make sense.Build it!I know. Of course there are businesses that will work. There are many examples I’m forgetting.I’m okay with that. Because in 10 years being very close to this business, I haven’t known a single person to start a musician focused business and sell it for a meaningful amount in that timeframe. The examples I can think happened over 10 years ago. So, I’m a pessimistic bastard, but hopefully at least sharing this experience will help you set expectations.Now, go prove me wrong.Published inEntrepreneur, Designer, Engineer.

Over the last couple of years I’ve helped more than hundreds of entrepreneurs, founders, employees and other people involved in startups and corporate projects. While I strongly believe that the overall quality is improving, I’m still surprised to see how often founders are making the same mistakes. I can’t tell you how to start your startup, but I will share some piece of advice which I think could help you along the way to avoid the most common pitfalls of running one.Let’s keep this one short and clear: Data about how your users are (not) using your product or service is When the data starts rolling in, make sure to focus on the biggest drops first and make sure to fix your leaking funnel. This means that you optimize the steps in the funnel where the highest percentage of people are slipping away first.If you keep spending money on user acquisition while having a leaking funnel, you have a better chance of winning by putting all your money on red in the closest casino.In addition to the leaking funnel above, I want to quickly share something about retention, the most common overlooked thing amongst most founders I’ve met.I hope the latter, since this means so much more for your business in general. The 1 million visits is what we like to call a vanity metric. It doesn’t say anything nor does it help you to pay the bills If we all agree on the above, why do so many founders focus on user acquisition and marketing only? Optimize your product with a small group of highly retained users first and then try to scale the product into the next big thing. Finding the difference in a pattern between users that stick and the ones that churn is what separates the men from the boys.To be honest, this is probably the most difficult one and therefore even more important. It takes most teams a while before this becomes weekly routine, but the ones that do are always improving.I can’t stress the importance of running experiments, always. Whether it’s a simple A/B test with a huge difference or a very detailed pricing strategy, please try to move the needle all the time. Since most startups are depending on results fast, you can’t afford to waste time by only talk and think about how you will gain those new users.So you’ve found a scalable channel that works for your business? Awesome, you found yourself something pretty cool. Now it’s an option to spend all your time and money to double down on this channel, right? Unfortunately that’s only half of the truth…Yes, you should spend some of your money to double down and squeeze everything out of the channel as fast as you can. But, you should never put all your eggs in one basket. You don’t want to rely on SEO only and then become the victim when Google decides to change their algorithm over night. Therefore you should aim to always have at least two or three customer acquisition channels that work well. When a channel becomes less profitable or saturated, you start being creative and find a new one.Make sure one of your channels is controlled by you to become less dependent on others. This could be your own blog doing content marketing or growing your Instagram account.Growing the product is probably the most difficult thing for every startup. Therefore you should embed growth into the core of your business DNA. It’s not only the responsibility of the marketing and growth department, it should also be a priority in the development backlog.Every single person in the team should be involved in growing the company on a weekly basis. Challenge each individual to come up with experiments within their own responsibilities and let them challenges others ideas.Money is the only validation to find out whether your business is sustainable in the long term in my humble opinion. I see so many startups focus on user growth only. Yes, chances are that you end up becoming an unicorn and don’t need to worry about a business model for the short term. But this only happens to a very lucky few, so please start with a business model from day one.Charging users isn’t a crime. If your product or service is good enough that it makes their lives easier or more fun, they’re happy to pay for it. If your users don’t want to pay, maybe you’re targeting the wrong audience.Many new startups have grown a substantial part of their user base because they understood the value of outstanding customer support. By now this piece of advice should be a no-brainer, unfortunately it’s still not for most startups.Even if you’re a new startup in a very competitive market, customer support could be a tactic to win over your competitors customers in the long term. Putting your customers first always wins, period.A typical question when I meet (new) people is to ask them how things are going with their startup, product, service or job. Being both interested and polite. During the years I found out that the smartest founders I’ve worked with always answered this question honest and sincere. They drop the sales pitch, share their challenges and let me think along. It gives me the opportunity to help them, and if I’m not able to help them myself it gives me the ability to happily connect them with some of my peers.As a founder it can be necessary to pretend that things are working out better then they actually are. Never lie, but you can leave out the ugly parts sometimes. I do want to note something though, since I never understood why some founders never share their challenges or will always tell you how well things are going.First of all, no business ever founded didn’t ran into challenges neither were they home runs. It took hard work, time and persistence. If you’re not willing to share for some reason, be my guest. Asking for help and advice is not uncool, not asking is.Freelance Growth Hacker for Startups  Corporates (currently

The practice of vesting terms for founders is commonplace. The exact terms, however, are an ongoing debate across the startup world. The basis, though, remains in tact: Founding team members must earn their share of the company by providing value.In my opinion, the best founder vesting terms for startups consists of 2 main points:While these terms are common for employees, they are less so for founders. Most founders I know seek to implement a quicker vesting schedule than this. Here’s some specific examples of terms I’ve seen founders use to gain legal ownership in a timely fashion:Furthermore, even if all the founders remain, to me, this is still a red flag on culture — the founders are trying to optimize for all the wrong reasons.Having founded a few startups together (and also invested in / advised a handful more) the vesting discussion between As much as we trust each other and have enjoyed working together for several years, there’s simply no way we’re going to alter founder vesting terms on any new business we start together.For Bliss we’ve taken it one step further. Inspired by We started fundraising for our seed round ~2 months ago and have had some initial momentum, but dealing with the summer vacation schedules of potential investors, the full $500k could easily slip until Q4.In the article noted above, Jason challenges SaaS founders to vest over 5 years and have the cliff start one year after closing a seed round. We tried to have our founder vesting terms more in line with Jason’s challenge, but our legal counsel encouraged us towards the terms above mainly to keep things simple, but we implemented the seed round stipulation — a new clause for Ian and I.We agree with these insights from Jason and combined with our general beliefs in founder vesting, we’re happy to not start our 1-year cliff until we’ve closed on our first $500k from outside investors.So, even though Bliss was originally developed last summer in our previous company (as an internal tool) and we’ve been working 24/7 on this one idea all of 2015, if Ian or I leave ~14 months from today we’ll get nothing!Despite our initial traction with revenue and customers, we realize that we still have a long way to go and trying to optimize for ownership now is like hoarding monopoly money — it’s worthless!We realize most founders aren’t in the position we are, going on a third company together. The shares/vesting conversation is a difficult one, but it needs to happen. Getting this on paper early removes uncertainty and assures the founding team is on the same path. Furthermore, if you and your co-founders can’t work through this discussion it should raise red flags about your future as there will be many more difficult challenges and conversations down the road.-CEO of Handpicked business, marketing, design, and technology articles for entrepreneurs and startups.

Branding is important even from the get go, so don’t forget it.Everything you do resonates from these initial guidelines you’re about to create, the way you talk to your users, the way people perceive you as a company and the way you look!So you’ve just come up with an idea, or have been working on one for a while but have not even thought about branding, then this article is for you.This is the key, it should encapsulate what makes you different, what you offer, why you’re doing it and how you’re going to present it. It’s the glue that binds together all the elements of your brand and ideally it should inform everything that you do, no matter how big or small. Basically, just jot down your idea as succinctly as possible.Where do you want your company to be in the future and how will it challenge the existing market? What are your goals? Put down everything you want to achieve as a company, and eventually you’ll narrow this down to one or two statements.The way you decide to present your communications — the tone, language and design for example — can be said to be the personality of your company. Choose 5 words that describe your personality (This usually has a lot to do with the founder).What do your users value most from your service? It’s important to ensure that your brand is always focused on appealing to the user. Put down the most useful parts of your service that appeal most to your users and what do they get out of it?This is a set of words your startup lives by. What do you as a company want to live by? Future employees will be able to look at these words and know how you work, how you act and how you communicate.So why did you start this project? Where did the idea come from and why? And why are you the one for the job?This is how you talk to your users no matter which medium you’re using; Email, website, phone. This is 5 words that sums up how you communicate with your users. An example would be “Helpful”.Otherwise known as a tagline. It is the shortest, most snappy way of describing your startup. Perfect for a landing page!The brand essence is the single intangible attribute that differentiates the brand from your competitors’ brands, as perceived by the audience. It is the way your customers should feel when engaging with the brand. This is pretty tough, but you should come up with one word that sums up how your users feel when using your service. Does it give them something extraordinary, do they feel empowered?For more tips like these, sign up to my newsletter — So now you should have a pretty decent overview of your startup, you can start putting it all together, and working on a design that matches up with your brand, taking everything into consideration.

It is slightly worrying that I keep seeing The Startup Hustle™ articles making the rounds again, reminding the founders that if you don’t give up everything that life’s worth living for, like a healthy relationship with your spouse, your company will most likely fail.You know all those lessons about how you have to scale your business quickly to call yourself a startup? Well, guess what — sacrificing life to run your company just doesn’t scale in the long run. You can’t out-hustle your competitors and you can’t out-execute others by working longer hours.For years now, I seen both the 100-hour-a-week and 30-hour-a-week companies fail and succeed and absolutely none of those were because of how much they worked. On the other hand, all of it depended on how well they understood their market and how quickly they could adapt to change. This is what will kill your company, not actually having time to enjoy life outside work.I’ve been through working super long weeks to make sure everything is in place and I can tell you what happens after a couple of months or years of going like that. You’ll get tunnel vision, failing over and over again and not understanding why, because you lack broader picture. You’ll start cutting corners, sacrificing quality for shipping. You’ll start resenting your work, producing worse and worse results. Eventually, you’ll just give up.The hustle is bullshit and it will make you unhappy. Forget about it. Learn to delegate work. Challenge assumptions. Fail quickly and often. Talk to your users. Be humble, frugal and resourceful. Focus on what matters. This, not working a hundred hours a week will make your company successful. Be nice, work hard, build something that matters. Designer, developer, co-founder of Lifetramp.com.

My name is Kori Handy and I am a designer and a mobile startup called First is finding the ideas, think long and hard how you can solve a problem using technology, you really need to understand your market if you want to design a startup from scratch. Don’t just copy snapchat or tinder (even the UI) be creative, be a trailblazer. I suggest starting with something you find interesting or have domain experience in already (sports, education, photos, messaging..etc) and work on a platform you understand designing for. (iOS, Android..etc)Workflow is really important, startups are inherently different than any other type of business in the world. The designer in a startup will wear many hats (much like other team members), here on my duties on any given day as a design founder.Now you have a bit more of a understanding for what I could be doing on any given time/day, this obviously does not include the ongoing job of emailing.I generally don’t use wireframing tools I have honestly never used them, I find them cumbersome and bulky. I challenge you to be more iterative and leaner and stop using them to wireframe your ideas and designs. Instead try white board drawings, sketching in a notepad, and doodling (even if you suck at drawing do it, its not a art show) this will allow you to get ideas out of your head faster, and also iterate on things in “real time”. Drawing wireframes can also be a great collaborative exercise with small teams because everyone can hop in and edit a drawing or add a drawing.After our little team agrees on a general direction for features, pages and a rough draft of the layout I generally jump right into pixels and start hammering out designs, this is my favorite time, the headphones go on and the EDC is pumping through my veins (I feel like my creativity spikes with good music, and at odd hours like 1 am).My design tool of choice is I typically layout a bunch of art boards 640 x 1136, then I layout a giant board too, the giant board is where I design assets like icons, logos..etc then I group the graphics I need and copy and paste them to art boards as needed (you can also make symbols).To view my designs on my iPhone I use the Sketch iPhone app, it’s amazing because you can view exactly what your app will look like on device. The app lets you swipe through your artboards and even scroll longer boards, there’s rumors that Sketch is working on adding basic transitions and hot spots to the app in the near future to rivl some simple prototyping products.So my team is me and my cofounder in our garage, communicating designs is as simple as turning my head and talking. But startups that are a little bigger will be using something like InVision, I also enjoy using Invision, it allows me to get instant feedback from my team, investors, and even early users on things that might need more work, or clarification.At this point I make a few iterations, not many though because the test pool is usually really small and can become a design by committee thing real quickly. I use my gut and small bit of data we collect, but I generally have a handle on the visual look/feel so I tend to focus more on UX and information architecture during feedback loops.I start exporting all my assets to slack, we made a assets channel to make things organized and it acts as a design repo that we can date stamp. I typically just export via PNG but lately I have been playing with PDF mainly because it cuts down time and in a startup time savings is good, get the product out fast. But in a larger startup they might ask for just PNG with the typical @1x, @2x, @3x its always good to discuss this with your developer because they are usually the ones who will be importing them to Xcode. (don’t ever use JPG. ok)While the dev work is being done, I usually take this time to design the app store icons, and marketing pages, I use a cool tool Looks like you’re basically all set now, your app is built, the app store knows you’re alive, and things are looking solid. Now its time to push out a Fabric or test flight build and send it out to friends or an email list of people who wanted beta invites, let the games begin your life is about to get crazy because you might have just built the next big thing?I will go deep on the entire process soon! thanks for reading.Follow me on Twitter (@Koridhandy) to stay updated on startups and design.Design founder We are a global tribe creating the startup community we’ve always wanted.

Which, on one level, is fine. Music is great! Working in an area you’re passionate about is awesome. But that passion can also be a double-edged sword, leading you to think that everyone is just as passionate as you are about a certain subject, and clouding your judgement about whether your product is actually something that can scale.A few months back, Google User Experience Researcher Tomer Sharon posted a fantastic talk about perfectly executing the wrong plan. His presentation wasn’t specifically aimed at music startups, but much of it rang true to me. As someone who has been to countless music hack days and demo events, as well as consulted and worked for several music startups, the six problems he outlined mapped perfectly onto many of the failed startups I’ve seen.The first problem is that creators assume their personal pains translate to something the wider world actually need. Now, sometimes this works — the founders of Uber probably noticed you couldn’t get a cab in San Francisco. But in music, that’s not often the case — just because you want a fun way to share playlists with friends, doesn’t mean everyone does.The truth is that most people don’t care as much about music as you do. Most people are happy to buy a few albums a year, maybe check out a few concerts, and listen to the radio in the car. That’s hard for intense music fans to fathom sometimes, but it’s true.Unfortunately, if you surround yourself with other music fans, you’re not likely to see this. The second problem is that startup founders often seek feedback from friends and family, who are likely to be biased. It stands to reason that if music is a big part of your life, you’ll be drawn to people who also love music and are likely to think your music startup idea is a great one. As for asking the non-music fans in your life, they’re also unlikely to be brutally honest. Your dad might not have bought an album since the 80s, but he’s not going to be negative about your idea, either.Even after all that, let’s say you go ahead and build your music startup. You put something together, you test it with users, and the users like it — but it still never takes off. Alas, fatal flaw number three: listening to users rather than observing their behavior.Concert subscription startup Jukely raised $8 million this week, and good on them. They are joining a crowded market, and I fear that they are going to fall prey to the same fallacies that have plagued other live-music startups. It’s not that concerts aren’t easy to find; it’s that they are not easy to attend for many people. The live music audience, for the most part, is made up of people in their twenties — mostly because people in their twenties in major cities can afford to go to shows and stay out late. They’re just competing for the same small piece of the pie as everyone else, without addressing a bigger problem — concerts are off limits for people older than 30, for the most part. The real problem for many people isn’t that they don’t want to see music, it’s that they can’t stay out until midnight when they have careers and kids to think about. Rather than innovating around that problem, most concert startups simply write off older audiences and assume that only young people want to see music and just need new ways to access it.This leads into the fourth problem, which is that most music startups don’t test their riskiest assumption. Spotify, Tidal, etc. all operate from the assumption that enough people care about music to pay $120 a year (or more) to listen — and that might not be the case. Even at the height of the boom in the late 90s, the average consumer spent about $28 a year on recorded music, and that was without all the free options available today.The other risk startups take when entering the music space is that they simply don’t know anything about the music business. The “launch first, ask questions later” mentality is hard to pull off in music — love it or hate it, the rights holders still call shots, and trust me, they’re reading But by this point, founders are buried deep in problem five — the Bob the Builder mentality. They’ve lost sight of Because here’s what will happen: You will have perfectly executed the wrong plan. You’ll have a sexy, cool music app that no one wants, needs, or cares about. The music tech business is a graveyard littered with startups that seemed so cool at the time, because the founders loved them. And maybe those founders found some people with money who thought that working in a bank was boring and investing in a music startup would be a great way to meet famous people and get dates. They all went to SXSW, and lit some money on fire, and crashed and burned a few years later.And look, no one dies when this happens. The money goes to money heaven and everyone just goes and does something else. But the problem with building startups because you just love music and assume everyone else does is that you don’t come any closer to solving the real problems. There are interesting businesses to be built in the music space; you just have to come at them from a colder, more analytical perspective.

This is the first in a series of open source documents written by In July of 2015, we launched our first pilot. We’re now preparing to launch a second pilot to learn everything we missed. A second pilot would not be necessary if we understood everything written below prior to our initial launch.Think about it. Both have:What people often forget is that even if you have a reason, a dream, and money to burn, you still need to prove your hypotheses. In research, this is the experiment. If executed correctly, the data from this pilot will help:With all of this ammunition, you’re At Cosmos Labs, we make mobile data affordable by enabling our customers to pay as they go for access to individual apps, rather than paying for expensive monthly data plans.We had less than two weeks to build a product and launch, and as a result our pilot was far from perfect. We came in with one (very not well thought out) hypothesis to validate:To test this, we set up a pilot in which we donated Cosmos-enabled devices to a homeless shelter in Detroit. The product delivered is explained in a 1-minute video below.Our customers loved our product. Seeing people use the internet for the first time is an amazing experience. However as we finished up the pilot, it became clear that we did not understand what “love” meant quantitatively. There were still so many assumptions that needed to be crafted into hypotheses and validated before we could be an Here are some suggestions based on our experiences that will help you get more out of your pilot.Our first pilot was far from perfect. We proved out some of our hypotheses, but not good enough to be a X + Y = Z company. Luckily we have fantastic investors that trust in our team, but to take it to the next level we’ll need to operate a bigger and better pilot.So why open source our learnings? It’s in our DNA.

CEO of 21.co and Board Partner at from the Twitter stream-of-consciousness of 

I would first like to start off by saying, So here it is…I grew up in a small town of a couple thousand people in the Okanagan area of British Columbia, Canada. My dad was a hot dog vendor that worked on the busiest street in the heart of downtown Kamloops, BC. Over the years, he saved up enough money to build his dream home in Shuswap Lake, BC. He had always longed to have a Bed  Breakfast on the lake and now his dreams had come true. You would never give a passing thought about what kind of life the man selling you street meat lived.Shortly after we moved to the lake and my parents got divorced and my mom was forced to find a new property. She found a small two-bedroom mobile home to rent for us. It wasn’t easy moving from my dad’s beautiful log chalet to an old mobile home. I wasn’t worried about it because I knew it was only temporary. The months passed and my mom started looking for a home to purchase. She worked as the head cook in a restaurant on the lake, so my expectations of where we were going to move were much higher than what she could afford.After months of searching, my mom found another mobile home with an attached 2/3 acre property beside it. I couldn’t believe we were renting one old mobile home and now she was purchasing an even older mobile home. She kept telling me that it was a good investment and it would pay off in the long run. I was only eight at the time and didn’t understand why she was making such a stupid decision. Little did I know she would tell me four years later,One of moms greatest priorities was always keeping the fridge full of food. I slowly learned how lucky I was and although she couldn’t give my brother and I everything we wanted, we always ate very well.Having a materialistic personality caused me to complain a lot about not having things my friends had. New clothes, toys, bikes, spending money for candy, etc. She was a single mom and worked long hours to provide for my brother and I. She just couldn’t afford the extra’s because it wasn’t in her budget.One day she got fed up with me comparing myself to my friends at school and decided to show me her financial situation. She said,After that, I shut up and never complained about money again. I understood the math and that her expenses were more than the money she was bringing in each month.A couple years later, I got a job as a dishwasher at the restaurant my mom worked at. I was only eleven and couldn’t legally be on payroll. So the manager decided to pay me a portion of what the servers were tipping out every night. After the servers found out about this they lost it. The restaurant manager concluded that they would pay me under the table.I worked like crazy as a kid and soon had thousands of dollars in my bank account. When you’re eleven, $100 seems like a lot of money. But when you have thousands of dollars in your savings account, you think you’re unstoppable. I started to buy all kinds of unnecessary “things” because what else do you buy at that age? My mom quickly noticed how much I was spending and began to teach me about budgeting and investing.I learned that if I take my money and invest it, it would pay off in the long run. I couldn’t invest in stock or anything that was high risk because of my age, so I just started with a simple savings account and GICs.As I grew up I became fascinated by financial literacy. I first started with Rich Dad Poor Dad and soon began to build a library of books that would teach me about investing, budgeting, and cash flow. While my friends would party on weekends I was only focused on my future and ensuring it was a successful one.My first venture was a clothing line I started at sixteen. I hated how cheap companies would make t-shirts and mark them up by 100% to customers. I knew there had to be a way to provide people with a t-shirt made of quality breathable material that could sell for the same price as all the retail stores products. I knew all the best designer brands were made in Italy and the small town I grew up in mostly consisted of Italians. So I decided to name my company, Desiderio which stands for “desire” in Italian.That summer I trademarked the logo, incorporated the company, and had 150 t-shirts printed. When I arrived back to school in the fall, I told a couple friends about the company I started. They loved the quality of the t-shirts and the logo of my company, so I was able to sell a couple shirts for twenty-five bucks a pop. Soon I started having people approach me in my high school and ask if I had anymore t-shirts available. First it was one, then three, then five. Before I knew it I sold all 150 t-shirts. There’s nothing like the feeling of walking down your high school hallways and noticing every second person wearing your brand.I decided to create a business plan for Desiderio and enter it into a contest for small businesses. I placed second and won a $2000 cheque to help further build my startup. Over the years I continued to work on Desiderio and further educate myself on financial literacy until I was finally old enough to invest. Since entrepreneurship was such a highlight in my life, it only made sense to enroll in university for business  marketing.Shortly after my eighteenth birthday, I booked an appointment at TD Canada Trust bank to set up a Waterhouse account so I could begin to invest in stock. I remember walking into my appointment and being drilled with questions from one of the financial planners. She asked to see every piece of ID in my wallet because she thought my appointment was a prank. It made perfect sense. I did look very young for my age and it’s not too often you see an eighteen-year-old setup a Waterhouse account. After she knew I was serious and my meeting was definitely not a prank, she was blown away that I was doing this. She worked at the bank for years and only set herself up with a Waterhouse account the previous week. Every Christmas she sends me a card to check up on how I’m doing and congratulates me for taking the steps to becoming financially free.My second venture was a concert promotions agency. I met my best friend in university and after we completed our first year, we went back home to our summer jobs. I worked at a small Provincial Park doing maintenance and yard work, while he put on a couple of sold out concerts in his small town.When we arrived back for our second year of university, I couldn’t believe how well his concerts did. The feelings of jealousy drove me to team up with him and take the concert promotions business model to a new level. We named the agency, “Go Live Entertainment.”Over the next couple years, we toured across Canada hosting several live shows for weeks at a time. We had the opportunity to experience a lot of amazing things and meet a lot of amazing people. Our goal was to bring class and professionalism to the music industry. This was and still is, a rare trait to find in promoters. Our motto was,We worked as hard as we possibly could to ensure that everyone knew about our concerts. This marketing strategy is what kept us afloat in the industry.On one of our tours, we lost so much money that the band offered to let us sleep and tour in their bus. This saved a majority of our travel and lodging expenses, but we were still over $20,000 in debt. We felt like our world was falling apart. This lesson helped me learn to manage risk and use strategy to bail myself out of uncomfortable financial situations. The only options we had were to pay off the debt with a minimum wage job or do more successful shows to break even. We were fortunate enough to turn a profit on a couple more tours over the year until we broke even. This learning experience was a big stepping stone in my life. Although it was tough I wouldn’t change it for the world.I ended up dropping out of university and enrolling in college because I couldn’t stand to spend four years of my life in a lecture hall. I took the investing knowledge I gained from the books I studied over the years and began to invest in stock and mutual funds while in school. After college, my best friend got a job in Toronto and moved out of our apartment. I was forced to find a new place to live because I couldn’t afford rent on my own. I had read about real estate investing for years and had always wanted to buy my own property. Before my best friend moved out, he bet me I wouldn’t buy a property. He knew I hated failing and was terrible at dealing with risk. That pissed me off, so I wanted to prove him wrong. A week later I put an offer on a small four bedroom bungalow right next to the university. Three weeks after that I closed and called my best friend to tell him I bought a house.After that, I knew I had to minimize my risk as much as possible. I withdrew all my savings to pay for the down payment on the house. Now I was forced to get the property rented or I would already be failing before I even started.To minimize my risk I started marketing the property online for rent while I was in the process of closing. I created a very informative ad with quality photos and made sure to promote it everywhere online. I wasn’t technically allowed to show the property to potential tenants because I didn’t own it yet. So instead, I hacked the system by putting all interested renters on a waiting list. I scheduled close to 40 groups of students to view the property the weekend after I closed and was easily able to fulfill the lease that weekend.At the time I purchased my first property I was working at a call center for a bank. I absolutely hated my job and couldn’t understand how some people had been working there for over twenty years. Imagine answering 100–200 calls per day for over two decades. This was definitely not the life I wanted to live. When my doctor decided to prescribe me medication for depression to help me deal with the stresses of my job I knew I had to get out.I started looking for marketing internships across Canada. I didn’t care where I had to move, as long as I never had to answer another banking call again I was happy. I went to school for marketing and my role at Desiderio and Go Live Entertainment mainly consisted of marketing the brands. So finding an entry role at a marketing firm seemed to be the best fit for my skillset.I was offered a four-month internship role at a small digital marketing firm in Toronto. I found a tiny basement apartment that weekend, packed up everything I could fit in my car, and left to Toronto to start a new chapter of my life.I thought I knew about marketing, but it turns out I didn’t have a clue. Digital marketing wasn’t something that was taught in school and had only blown up once people realized this whole “internet thing” was going to change the world. I learned a lot over the next four months and was thankful enough to be offered a full time position as a digital marketing strategist.I no longer had a job, I now had a career. In my first couple of months at the agency, I worked really long hours to prove my work ethic and it ended up paying off. I got promoted to Digital Marketing Manager and now had to manage one full time employee and four interns. Throughout the year I continued to work late into the night most days. It got to the point where I started to burn out and needed a break.I decided to take my mom and I on a trip to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. I got the chance to clear my head and didn’t have to think about work for a whole week. It turns out that vacation was the best thing I ever did. It made me think about what my true passion was and what I wanted to do the rest of my life. I always thought I would own a real estate empire and manage different properties across the country. Real estate had always been my true passion and with work and my new life in Toronto I had lost sight of that.I used to be concentrated on buying more property every year and expanding my portfolio. But what I was actually good at and what fueled my passion was marketing my properties. This is where my vacation changed my way of thinking. Instead of focusing on buying properties, my new focus was solving the problem of marketing rental properties online.This is where the story of how I started my startup begins…Everything you have read, up until now was the prologue. I wanted to prove to people that I wasn’t some kid that scowered the internet and grabbed a bunch of inspirational startup facts to post on Medium. I had to explain why I was different and why people thought I was deemed “crazy” for wanting to read and educate myself on financial literacy or stay up late working on one of my businesses than getting drunk every weekend.I also think you should know I am in no way an “expert” on startups. The advice I am providing you is not based on any data or statistics I have collected. This advice is solely based on what I have learned thus far in developing my startup.My new mission in life was to change the way people rent and list properties forever. I came up with the idea not because I wanted to get rich or because I thought startups were cool. It was because I knew there was a huge problem and I wanted to fix it.Whenever one of my properties is for rent, I am always able to obtain far more inquiries than my competitors. My neighbors and other landlords in my network would always ask me, “how do you get so many people interested in your property?” “What’s your secret?” What I do is actually no secret, I just know how to market my property better than my competitors and provide a better customer experience. I knew the demographic and type of tenant I wanted to attract and my marketing was reflective of this.I thought, imagine if there was a website where every landlord was forced to make listings that look as good as mine. They wouldn’t need to have years of marketing or sales experience. All they had to do is follow a simple 3 step process to creating a listing. This listing would only include the details that renters actually cared about and would eliminate any noise in a listing that would cause them not to convert.After going through the experience of renting several properties myself, I knew there was another problem I had to solve that was equally as broken on the renter’s side. I talked to a couple of my friends that were looking for properties to rent and I found out that I was not alone. The process of finding and renting a property was awful.In Canada, you have a small selection of websites that have terrible search filters, vague ads with low res photos, and communication barriers with landlords. Then once you finally find and view a property that interests you, you still need to complete an application, get approved, sign a lease, and provide first and last month’s rent.Our new mission is to change the process of renting and listing a property forever. We wanted it to be so easy that renters could eventually find properties anywhere in the world and within a couple steps they could secure a long term lease and feel fully confident about their decision without even having to view the property in real life.There was a fair amount of competitors in the U.S.  UK that had noticed the same problems we did and were creating companies to help solve those problems. But we didn’t care. We knew the process was still broken and nobody threatening enough was solving the problem to our degree.You need to want it so bad that your competition shouldnt even matter. If you have a better product and you have users that love it, then that’s the only thing you should care about. The more you focus on your competitors the more fear will consume you. Once this fear begins to take over, you take the first steps towards failure.You will hear this over and over again, but one of the single most difficult things you will have to do when starting a startup, is to find amazing co-founders. Co-founders that are even crazier than you and push you to your limits.When I first came up with the idea for the startup I knew I had to start looking for a technical co-founder. My expertise was in marketing, managing, and user experience design. I had always wanted to learn how to code, but was much more passionate about design. I emailed a couple close friends to see if they knew any good developers. My co-founder at Go Live Entertainment told me that one of the bassists from a band we use to tour with was now a freelance developer. I knew exactly who he was, but had no idea he switched career paths. I got his contact information and pitched him on the idea. He had told me that he was interested in working with a startup, and knew from how passionate I was about the idea that I would definitely be committed.Since we had not been best friends for years we agreed to handle the startup literally like a relationship. We said the first couple months would be the “dating period” where we would see how we communicate and if we got along with each other. After that we would get “engaged.” This consisted of launching our pre-launch page and formally signing founder vesting agreements. Later we would get “married” and officially launch our first beta to users.I feel like taking the “relationship” approach with your startup is the perfect solution because it shows how serious each of you are at each stage. If you’re not ready for a commitment and the “dating” stage was too much for you, then you should probably leave and let the people that are passionate and serious enough about the idea get “engaged.” If you get cold feet down the line and realize starting a startup is much more difficult than you thought. You probably shouldn’t get “married” because you will just be hurting the team and leading them on.In the first stages of starting a startup, I cannot stress enough how incredibly important talking to users is. So many startups focus 100% of their energy in building a product as fast as they possibly can, that they don’t even stop to think about whether there is a market for it. If you are a non-technical founder, this should be the only thing you do in the beginning. If you are technical founders, you should spend half your time building the product and the other half of your time talking to users.We first started with a small focus group of renters, landlords, and agents that would tell us the biggest problems they were experiencing. Instead of coming up with our own opinion of what we thought our users wanted, we used data. This allowed us to narrow down the three biggest problems users were experiencing. Our goal now is to focus all of our energy into creating three features to solve their biggest problems and half assing everything else in order to ship the product as fast as possible.In the startup world growing fast is the difference between obtaining a Series A and being stuck in the seed stage. If you decide to keep your job you need to dedicate every waking moment of time to your startup. Your startup should come before your social life and even your relationships. If you quit your job you still need to commit every minute of your day to growing, but take breaks to avoid burnout. I recommend eating healthy and exercising regularly.Create daily, weekly, and monthly goals and stick to them. Tackling big problems with little win’s everyday helps make the process of starting a startup less intimidating. It also ensures if you start to slack you will need to commit extra time before the deadline is up.After you have talked to as many users as possible and you are growing as fast as you can, your next goal is to find product market fit. Along with finding amazing co-founders, this is another one of the hardest things you will ever have to do when starting a startup. It doesn’t matter if you have spent years developing the greatest product the world has ever seen and if all your co-founders have an IQ of 150. If there is no market for that product, you will inevitably fail.There are many amazing startup ideas that have evolved over the last couple years, but rarely do I find companies that try to be truly unique. It’s so easy to want to copy another startup with a similar idea that you loose focus on your own. This was one thing I desperately wanted to avoid when developing my startup. I wanted our brand to have meaning and to be totally separate from our competitors.We first came up with the name bemyrental for our startup because the domain was available and it had a very important keyword in it. However, after thinking about the name over the next couple weeks I knew we could do better. This is when I came up with the name After we agreed on the new name it was now time for a logo. I wanted the logo to be able to tell a story and be simple enough for anyone to draw it. We went through a couple different variations and decided to pick the owl. This is what it’s comprised of:With new startups popping up every week it is crucial to separate yourself from the other’s. Don’t be afraid to be different, embrace it! Investor’s get pitched by hundreds or even thousands of startups per year. What are you going to do to stand out? What is going to make them remember you?Nobody wants to hear about the kid with the wealthy parents that funded their startup in the beginning. They want to hear about the group of smart, scrappy, friends that came up with something brilliant to grab the attention of the media.Finally, it’s not the end of the world if you fail. The sad truth is most startups do fail because they are unable to master the five lessons I discussed. I always tell myself,If you think of your startup as more of a hobby instead of a job it wont crush you as much if it doesnt go anywhere. All you need to do is change your thinking.I hope my story and advice has inspired you to create a startup or continue to grow your current one. The road to creating a startup is a long one. Be prepared to invest the next 10–15 years of your life. There are some people in this world that are cut out for it and other’s that give up too easily. My friends always ask me, “why would I ever commit so much time to something that might not even go anywhere?” My answer is always, because I wouldnt want to do anything else in the world. This is my passion. Just like how some people spend thousands of hours gaming and other’s spend thousands of hours watching TV. All I am doing is replacing the things most people do to entertain themselves and instead solving a problem. Some people might think youre crazy for doing this and that’s ok. All you need to do is remember this:•• If youre a parent, teach your children financial literacy as soon as you can. It’s the one thing that isnt taught in schools that today’s youth desperately need to know.• Find amazing cofounders that are just as passionate as you.• Prepare to give up your social life and if you are in a relationship make sure they are extremely supportive of your idea.• Create daily, weekly, and monthly goals and dont let the due date slip.• Grow as fast as you humanly can.• Focus on building an amazing product first before anything else.• Build things that dont scale.• Create an amazing user experience and differentiate yourself from others.• Talk to users, talk to users, talk to users.• Never stop learning.• Don’t start a startup until you have a problem you are facing and are passionate enough to dedicate your life to solving that problem.• Write down your core values right away and only hire people that breathe your mission.• Forget about competitors. If your product is better, than your competitors should be worried about you.• Eat healthy and exercise regularly.Co-founder, CEO of Serelo. Visit 

One of my friends from college has been at the same job for over 10 years writing missile software for the government. That sounds pretty damn cool, but he feels that his personal growth is stagnant.I know he’s not a graduating senior, but we talked about the different paths he could take.That means getting a job. I semi-jokingly asked if he’d be happy making $100k/year for the next 10 years in a cubicle at Oracle. The answer was obviously no, but how else could make enough to cover a mortgage, wife and kids?Freelancing, contracting or consulting could solve that problem! You can work from wherever you want and whenever you want. While it provides more freedom (not being in an office from 9–5), it’s not the optimal path for personal growth.You’ll learn a ton, but it definitely doesn’t solve the money problem. That idea was scratched quickly.Ah, it’s what everyone is doing these days and is the best path if you want to optimize for learning. This doesn’t solve the money problem today, but very well could in a year when your revenue catches up.This path is extremely hard for someone who has had a steady job for 10 years to take. Mainly because you’re fighting against your fears. How will you ever pay bills with no paycheck coming in every 2 weeks? How will you pay for that vacation coming up next month? How will you pay for rent?That fear makes you want to stay in your comfy job. Have fun convincing your spouse you wanna start a startup :)Go work with people at a fast growing startup. It didn’t even cross my mind that this was an option. But I’ve recently met a handful of people who dropped everything in their life to move to San Francisco.They had no job secured, they turned down high salaried jobs at top tier firms, and they went against their family’s advice. They arrived all with only the deterimination to figure things out. And that’s usually all you need =)To be fair, the salaries aren’t gonna be what you’re used to, but the founders have de-risked a ton of the business already. The upside is in the amount of knowledge you’ll learn in a short period of time and obviously your stock options. If you take the long view, this is a very very safe option.Update: Readers have been sending in some amazing advice!

One of my favorite bits of startup mythology is the prototypical entrepreneur: This person so overcome with zeal, so overflowing with passion that they’re willing to sacrifice sleep, relationships, years of their life, and a respectable credit score for the sake of their “Idea.”This maniacal, singular devotion compels them to stick it out through years of torment, Suffice it to say, I have not found this to be the case. I’ve been an entrepreneur my entire career, and if I had a nickel for every time my zeal wavered, my passion found a bottom or my conviction was, let’s say, hypomanic, I’d be committing 90% of my net worth to charity along with Zuckerberg and Buffett.The truth is, most entrepreneurs would probably tell you their relationship with their company is often complicated. Even when things are going well, they’re constantly in motion. People come and go, roles and responsibilities change and new challenges appear out of thin air.It’s possible to wake up one day and find that you’ve fallen out of love with your company. The thing that kept you coming to work everyday, that helped you emerge from periods of darkness, is gone.As in marriage, we’re left with three choices:I think the ability to fall in love with your company again and again — not a maniacal, unwavering conviction — is the real trait that keeps entrepreneurs going through thick and thin. The things I love about my company today are very different than the things I loved about my company a few years ago. What those things are isn’t that important, what Cofounder  CEO at Contently. Pop technologist, poker player, documentary watcher.

I’ve always been a huge fan of detailed, pages-long articles about a specific startup experience. Especially those concerning “getting your first users” (like There are a sh*t load of “theory” articles that tell you “how to do it” or “10 things to avoid when”. Although (some of) these articles are useful,As I work in a startup studio, I I’ve recently handledBoth Aircall  eFounders needed:Aircall particularly needed:eFounders particularly needed:… all that in France, Belgium and the US.In order to communicate on a new feature or an important milestone, you need to have communicated on your launch before. Pure logic. It has impacted our timing, our messages, the way we reached out to people (more on that below).Here’s the peak in traffic on eFounders’ website we got (We also got a few hundred signups for our products in beta (often mentioned and linked in the articles): The graph below shows the progression of candidates flow — from eFounders’ That’s the peak in Aircall’s traffic:Here is how much time and energy all that took me:≈ 8 days≈ 8 days in total (writing, preparing the campaign, contacting everyone, follow up)In both cases, finding the angle and writing the press material was very time-consuming. Once you have the right tools and a good database of contacts, the rest takes less time, you just need to be thorough.It’s hard to calculate an actual ROI. 16 days of work is a long time, but on the long-term, it was definitely worth it.[A little bit about myself: I used to be a journalist. I briefly worked for a tech blog and even though I only stayed there a few months, I used to receive tons and tons of press releases. And I didn’t read ⅔ of them. I know technically it was my job to do so, but it’s just not happening. So, if you needed me to write an article on your news (under embargo until like 2 min later) — you’d better be my friend.Now that I went through the looking glass, I’m trying to be friends with journalists. That’s all that matters.]We contacted around 20 journalists (in France  Belgium because eFounders is a Belgian company located in Paris — and the US) telling them about our model and how it’s a growing trend. To support that it was worth taking a look, we joined a Here is the email we mainly used:and we also tried this one, which pretty much didn’t work:No press release, just email / phone conversations.Since we were only reaching out to 20 people, a simple Excel sheet was sufficient. The real pain in the *** was all the copy-pasting, and the fact that I had to add my boss’ Gmail account as a sender and wasn’t able to track responses in real time (he would forward me the emails). So we built something to make that easy :) (see step 3)Here is how I spotted journalists:OK, I’m actually When it’s friends, email subject can be something like “I have a news for you!”Inside a startup studio, there are a lot of people who know a lot of people. I just sucked up all the “ecosystem juice” I could. Intros everywhere!When it’s friends, email subject can be something like “contact Name-of-your-introductor — news announcement”There’s a great tool to search webpages called Google. I used that. I also typed the same keywords in Twitter. If you want to be super fast in finding the email addresses, you can use When it’s someone you don’t know, email subject can be something like “news pitch — announcement-in-4-words”If you don’t know anyone at a specific media you don’t want to miss out on, focus on Twitter. Reaching out on Twitter really (Thibaud wrote the tweet himself. Although we genuinely only expected to get the conversation going with journalists, it still got us covered in A great deal of them answered what seemed to be the holy grail:When you’re announcing a small fundraising, it better be a good story. Like, you did it while bringing up a baby whale family or surviving a volcano eruption. Or that you actually already earn millions in revenue. Nothing like that happened to Aircall. They just struggled, like 99% of startups.We focused on the announcement of a launch + fundraising after a fairly large beta (11 months, beta users in 25 countries) and the potential of the market. We also implied that the product was working perfectly, hence the launch, which was a sugar-coated version of the truth (but who hasn’t faced a bug on Skype? Web RTC is just hard).Once again, there was a lot of copy-pasting… and between journalists contacted by me, eFounders, Aircall’s CEO Olivier directly, it was pretty hard to keep track.We wrote a press release  also a longer press “kit” (8 pages), because a press release doesn’t say much about the startup’s team, vision, facts and figures etc.I have no idea if any journalists actually read it :)You might be contacting journalists who are specialized in telecom or startups or business. I made sure to (same tactics as in press campaign #1)Because the amount of journalists we needed to contact was higher, and I started to think that a basic Excel sheet was not a very long-term tool to keep track of all contacts and PR campaigns, I tried Airtable.It’s basically an improved, more visual version of Excel.I didn’t search for long but it seems to me it’s the only tool where you can:There are other features which I didn’t use.Besides being actually featured in Now they’ve joined the amazing 500 startups accelerator and they show a 10% weekly growth. I’m not saying it’s because of the PR blast: it’s because they have an amazing product and the team is working its *ss off. But I like to think I brought my little stone to the edifice :)Only a few days after I finished surviving my Aircall-celebration hangover, I had to go back to work and start eFounders’ announcement. I had already done an important part of the job: building relationships with journalists.As I said before, I had some trouble wrapping my head around this news. 6 millions is a “medium sized” round of funding for a startup studio. And it is pretty original to have a single participant: Oleg — who happens to be Thibaud’s former partner at Fotolia.I had very long talks with my bosses on why we raised this amount, why with him, why now, why, oh why. And then I figured: if I’m asking myself that, journalists will probably do so. Therefore, I just needed to tell them: Here are some details on how we’ve built the press release:And here is the email we sent out. Because we like to build tools every time we stumble upon a pain point, our team built a tool to manage shared contacts. It’s an internal tool (for now) that we call ContactY. Thanks to ContactY, I basically did very little copy-pastes.I was able to :If you want the same for your own PR-ghost emailing tasks, I might be able to help out, We didn’t use pr.co again because In order to track results, I used Mention (one of eFounders’ products!) to:Although we focused the announcement on “what we’re gonna achieve with the fundraising”, some journalists rather opted for a “what is a startup studio” approach. No problem here, it’s absolutely in accordance with our need for evangelization.We contacted 31 journalists, among whom 26 were “medium/hot” leads and (the box in the corner is because we’ve moved out. So, yea, I had to un-pin the whole thing. Fun times.)Textmaster is the first company eFounders co-founded. It is now fully independent and managed its PR blast all by itself, with its usual PR person.So, I have nothing to do with their well-managed PR campaign, but it was pretty cool to get another (!) cool announcement from our “galaxy” in the news. We could have better managed the timing: they announced it only 2 days later because they wouldn’t risk a leak and wouldn’t risk falling into the summer-of-despair (seriously, are all journalists on vacation for 2 months? I sure wasn’t! Must have missed something there).One journalist I contacted for eFounders was pissed because I didn’t warn her about Textmaster. She read about it in Techcrunch. It was my responsibility to make sure all “my” contacts received the info they were supposed to. Now I’ll know: it’s not because a PR campaign is “closed” that you shouldn’t follow up with journalists.I hope it was useful. I know this PR story is pretty specific because of the startup studio model. But I’m sure there are lessons to learn for everybody.Now you can jump in and write: what do you think of my approach to PR? What would you have done differently? What should I improve?

I have already voiced a pretty strong opinion I spend a lot of time on the internet — it’s my job after all. I frequently stumble across little projects and startups that interest me. Often times I’ll sign up for their mailing lists in order to keep tabs on what they are doing. And about once a month, sometimes more, I’ll receive an email from a startup that they I can’t be the only one that feels like this is vastly irresponsible. Tech startups enter the game with a very high chance of failure when they take on venture funding (which most do). They take the money and hire employees, market their services. And in order to keep operating, they need to raise But what happens to all the people that depended on the service? They are all left high and dry. Suddenly, a critical part of their business infrastructure is no longer maintained, or will shut down in a month. Suddenly, the place they stored their writing and sent it out to their audiences has evaporated. Suddenly, the way they listen to music, or read the news when they get home from work is gone. The service they stored all the things they wanted to read or watch later is no longer holding on to that information. The tool they spent hours learning how to use has crumbled to dust. And all they get as a consolation is the ability to “download their data” and either an excited notification that the founder of the service is now rich, or a melancholy admission that the business simply cannot be sustained.How many times will people allow this to happen before they stop relying on startups, knowing that chances are in a couple months or years it will be pulled out from under them? Much like we learn when friends or acquaintances are unreliable and stop relying on them for things, Starting a business that people rely on cannot continue to be treated as a game, with people as disposable resources. In order for the innovation to continue moving at the pace it is today, we need to find a way for businesses to be created that are reliable and responsible, and consider that “users” are not simply a statistic but are actual people. It’s not an easy problem to solve by any means, but it absolutely is one that we need to be thinking about.Published inlifelong learnerHandpicked business, marketing, design, and technology articles for entrepreneurs and startups.

If you’re a startup founder thinking of going to a conference, don’t. Fuck that. Put your time and effort and money into building your business.Attending conferences feels meaningful because it takes effort, spending days and weeks planning travel itineraries and perfecting pitches and spending thousands on plane tickets and hotels and booths. It’s all effort not spent on your startup. Fuck that.Never go to a conference to meet investors on a whim. Investors are taken to dinner, have private rooms, attend private parties. They can avoid founders all day long, and plenty will. Some will attend a pitch contest out of curiosity, some because they want to see a specific team and others because they’ve been asked to judge or pass comment. Most won’t bother.Fuck that.There’s always a fairytale ending for somebody at a conference, always a chance meeting that results in founders and investors living Happy Ever After. Except it’s often not chance, but a pre-arranged meeting, planned weeks in advance. Don’t confuse the setting with the opportunity.If you’re happy to leave your funding round to serendipity, take a seat in a Shoreditch coffee house and wait for serendipity to happen. If that sounds ridiculous, it’s because it is. But stick a €3,000 price tag on the experience and suddenly that sort of idiot’s logic makes sense.Fuck that.If you’re in London, you’re surrounded by investors. They’re everywhere, hundreds of them. And they’re doing in London what they’ll do at any conference they attend — they’re ignoring you, unless you contact them in advance and arrange a meeting.Attend a conference if:Never:Co-founder  CEO 

You hear it time and time again, “Use your network.” Or, “It’s all about connections.” While these statements certainly carry some validity, it goes a bit deeper than that. There’s still a level of execution that needs to take place in order to properly leverage one’s network.Personally, I am constantly hearing from people within my network looking to have me connect them with investors or sales leads.99.9% of the conversations go something like this: “Do you happen to know any investors that might be interested in…” or; “I’d love to get an intro to anyone you know that…”Ok, I get it… you want me to instantly respond with amazing introductions that will move your business forward today (don’t we all?). The problem here is, I’m the one left doing the bulk of the work — Thinking through your business, scanning my contacts for those that align with your model or product and crafting an enticing email to each connection.Not only is this poor form, but it’s unrealistic.This is too time consuming to do for one person, but seeing I get asked this same question 5–10x per week from other founders — there’s just no way I’m going to follow through here. That’s the reality. It’s not because people don’t care or are not willing to help, but the time just isn’t there.If you want an intro, make it as simple as possible for me by figuring out exactly who I should introduce you to and thoughtfully explain why.Boom! There it is… it’s as easy as that.Once I know who I want to meet with for My email above to Kal does a few things:As you can see, I keep it short, direct and outline my intentions and Bliss’ value prop, making it super simple for Noah to forward along my email.As a rule of thumb, I will cap my ask of close friends at three introductions. I don’t want to burden them with more than that. I will, however, follow up with the same friends ~2 months later with three additional introductions.For people I just recently met I’ll stick to one introduction. I find that one action item is low enough friction where most people will follow through. On another note, if they don’t follow through then it’s a great indication they weren’t impressed with you or your business.Rolling up your sleeves and spending the time identifying the appropriate person to make an introduction goes a long way. Remember, if you don’t want to put the time in (for your own business!) to simplify the process for your contact, what makes you think they’ll put the time in?Give my strategy a go… And enjoy the steady stream of new introductions!CEO of 

It was a beautiful San Francisco night and we had just listened to a speech by an international investor about growing global markets and international opportunities for startups. We are building Ummah Wide with global and regional markets on our minds constantly so we decided to introduce ourselves and tell the investor about our company. Once we said we were focused on the global Muslim market his face changed. He began to look around, and we could tell he was uncomfortable.There are nearly 2 Billion Muslims on the planet, and this is the one story that is told, so it’s not really surprising that someone would say this to us and this experience helped us realize three things.Despite this one bad experience we had in San Francisco, we know that with the growth of entrepreneurial and In the San Francisco Bay Area where Ummah Wide is based, we have While the worth of this market is greater than any regional or national market of Muslims, the same could be said if we were to imagine what the networks of entrepreneurs, tech talent, mentors, and investors would look like if we were able to leverage these regional entrepreneurship networks into a global ecology. This especially makes sense when we have tens of thousands of highly talented and deeply connected Muslims living and working in places like Silicon Valley and San Francisco, New York, London, Paris, Berlin, and Sydney who are globally connected to the other key hubs of Muslim entrepreneurship, life and culture throughout the world.Also check out Open a travel guide and you can find tips for almost any type of unique traveler, except for the Muslim community which makes up nearly one-quarter of humanity.

SoulCycle, an indoor cycling studio, launched in New York City in 2006 and will have expanded to 55 locations by the end of 2015. Hockey stick growth.Its founders are credited with helping kickstart America’s latest boutique fitness craze. Many have written about the company’s cult-like success:Last night, I walked into my 3rd ever SoulCycle class.During a spirited remix of Save Tonight, a very strange thought popped into my head:While enterprise software has little to do with a consumer lifestyle brand, at Uptake we talk non-stop about the value of curiosity; unexpected connections across companies and industries can drive tremendous insight.So fuck it. Let’s have some fun, dive in, and draw weird comparisons to see what tech entrepreneurs can learn from SoulCycle’s success.I’ve decided that any article about SoulCycle is required to describe to its customers as If this sounds familiar, you’ve probably read Kevin Kelly’s It’s easy to get caught up in broad, pitch-deck definitions of your total addressable market. My friends at SoulCycle also encourages instructors to showcase their personalities on social media. These stories drive home the narrative that the product is a unique experience, powered by people — and allow riders to buy-in even more deeply by talking to and forming relationships with instructors.Find your own Instagram; prioritize channels that your target market naturally gravitates towards.Hardware is commoditized! Not sure if I’m talking about servers or spin equipment, but, if you haven’t noticed, most indoor cycling classes have the same bikes and equipment. You can tinker with the room’s setup around the edges (more premium products, lighting in the room, scoreboards, etc.) but in my novice head: a bike is pretty much a bike.So how do you differentiate from the hundreds of other studios? The same way many human capital powered businesses do: talent.SoulCycle offers a different compensation package than their competitors. They want the best, so they treat them like the best. In return for exclusive deals they offer more stability (health insurance), higher salaries (the job is, potentially, very lucrative), and motivate instructors by making them entrepreneurial and asking them to build their own audience under the broader support of the brand.You don’t want to get into a price war over a data scientist, but you should find ways to creatively outmaneuver your competitors in a race for talent.There must be thousands of articles on the power of teams. They help increase motivation, productivity, buy-in, etc. And SoulCycle embraces this psychology more than most businesses I’ve seen.For a high-end product (often described as exclusive) when a first time rider enters a class they’re immediately welcomed as a part of many groups. In my class last night, Brent, our instructor, explicitly mentioned teams so many times that I would be shocked if it wasn’t an important part of training.We were a part of: the “SoulCycle family”, a “Chicago community helping launch Soul”, “Brent’s class”, the “Sunday Night crew”, etc. Many constructs that all hammer home the same idea: Borrow from this.Customers fit into multiple teams; reward them and help them buy into the company and product. They want to believe they have access to something (community, software, a deal, etc.) that’s exclusive or insanely valuable. They want to be a part of something, whether they know it or not.Employees are teams, too. Rally around product teams, sprint teams, functional areas. It’s a small win but can be very influential.I’ve always liked SaneBox’s Similarly, SoulCycle makes no apologies for premium pricing. Unlike many gyms, they moved off a membership model that thrives on breakage. Instead, they charge per class. Pricing is worthy of a longer post, their model also helps with demand generation in interesting ways. But, I’ll move on.A related point: Find ways to cross-sell without diluting your brand. SoulCycle drives meaningful revenue by selling items like water and apparel to their customers. What started as a marketing play has since expanded, quality fitness gear proved to be a hit with core fans.SoulCycle does a great job of removing friction at checkout — few abandoned carts to see here. Two quick examples…(1) They stored my credit card in an account after one visit. A rider checks into each class at the front desk. It’s a seamless offline experience to ask for rental shoes or a water bottle; no need to pull out a credit card. Most people ahead of me in line did this. I bet pricey, fancy water has nice margins.(2) Simple account information. If you forget your password at checkout, rather than removing you from the flow to send to you to a ‘Request Password’ page, a simple module pops up along the top navigation. You can request or reset a password without losing your place. The bikes you’ve reserved are yours and with one click to login to the module you’re back purchasing whatever you wanted to buy.This one’s pretty common thanks to Microsoft.SoulCycle’s corporate employees are required to work the front desk for at least a week. Many companies have similar programs. You should too. Have your team answer support emails and calls to truly understand customers.No customer is the same. Find ways — ideally scalable, but any effort here will do — to customize each person’s experience.As While it’s easy to believe that most spin classes are 99% identical, SoulCycle goes to great lengths to fit the music and workout to the customers in the room or type of year (local events, holidays, etc.)Your product should feel consistent, but finding ways to personalize the experience can be a big win if executed properly. It helps adoption and experience when your users feel like the product was built just for them.I know, I know. How many times can one phrase be written across countless posts offering unsolicited advice to startups? It’s important for a reason.SoulCycle’s instructors shout out to riders by name, encourage them in the middle of class, and build direct relationships before and afterwards. They note big events like a wedding or birth and spend time off the bike, running around the room and interacting during the ride.On a related note: It seems like much has been written about being a strong enough rider to sit in the font row (although anyone can select those bikes.) Embracing community norms that empower and reward your users can be incredibly impactful.As Peter Thiel would ask: What’s your secret?In a few interviews, the SoulCycle founders say they were fitness users, not teachers. They attribute much of their success to finding a need that wasn’t being met in the community. They created a class where many in the community wouldn’t have seen opportunity or an ability to differentiate because they knew something — about community and experience — that others didn’t.They were also agile in their approach. They started with an MVP of a studio and iterated around that core idea and vision before eventually expanding.So, that’s it. Interesting food for thought. A retrospective in the middle of the exciting marathon that is building Uptake on what (from a distance) looks like it’s also working for SoulCycle.Like a million other articles offering unsolicited advice, take each of these with a grain of salt. Every situation is different. Good luck and thanks for coming along down this rabbit hole with me!Building 

After 7 startups full-time and another 20+ as an investor/advisor, it’s become clear to me that startups should do a better job with all aspects of their incentive stock compensation, and not just follow convention because it’s “what we’ve always done.” This has been on my mind for a while, and after a recent [also should add company buyback rights (no) and acceleration upon acquisition (100% double-trigger) as noted below in the July 31, 2015 update]Let’s say Calvin decides to leave Startup #1, where he has 10,000 stock options vesting over 4 years, to join Startup #2, where he has been offered 20,000 stock options vesting over 4 years. He thinks “wow, that’s double the stock!” Uh, no. What he failed to understand was the 10,000 options represented 1% of the fully diluted shares of Startup #1, whereas the 20,000 options only represent 0.5% of the fully diluted shares of Startup #2. So he ended up with less ownership of the company. There are a lot of very savvy startup employees out there who know to ask the right questions, but there are also many who don’t know which questions to ask.I can’t tell you how many times I’ve made an offer and a potential employee does not know the right questions to ask in order to understand the true value being offered. I go out of my way to ensure I explain the nuances in each case, and these potential employees are so happy someone has finally explained this to them.Employees should be informed, not duped. When a potential employee is joining a startup, they should be told what percentage of the company their stock option grant represents, and how much stock is owned by various groups (preferred investors, founders, employee pool). This is sometimes difficult in capped note situations where a valuation has yet to be determined, but an estimate can be made in those cases. Note I am not suggesting that every employee’s stock option amount be exposed to every other employee.Employees should be allowed to exercise their stock options early. There are huge tax advantages to exercising stock options when granted, even if they have not been vested. There are definitely nuances here, but it’s my belief the benefits to the employees far outweight the potential issues for both the employee and company. It’s possible this may need to be limited to the first 50 or 100 employees, but for the early employees who have the most to gain (and lose to taxes), this should be standard practice.The day came and went like any other day. It was a Wednesday. I had been debating back and forth whether or not to exercise the stock options of my former employer before they expired. I chose to let them expire for a variety of reasons including the possible risk/reward of writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars, the preferred investor preferences stacked in front of the common stock, and my guess at the potential exit value of the company. Only time will tell if that was the correct decision.Countless startup employees go through this same calculus typically 90 days after their last day of work at a company. For an employee who spent 3 years working extremely hard for a startup to walk away with no stock because of an arbitrary 90 day exercise window seems odd to me. Maybe that employee has decided to go back to school for an advanced degree. Or maybe life has interceded and a move across the country is necessary due to family matters. Or maybe they decided to go start a company of their own. As a multiple-time founder and CEO, it always hurts to lose an employee, but to be vindictive on the way out, especially for a great performer, seems petty and short-sighted. They worked hard, they If you early exercise, you don’t need this right. But not every employee will early exercise due to the cost involved upfront and potential tax consequences. 90 days is too short. Pinterest’s practice of providing 7 years to exercise after you leave (provided you stayed at the company for at least 2 years) seems like a reasonable proposal. Others propose 10 years. I’d stick with 7 years for now.This one is a little more controversial because it’s not necessarily better for employees. Standard vesting schedules are typically 4 years vesting monthly with a 1 year cliff. That means the employee gets 25% of the options every year, and some argue this structure is fine. However, some founders believe that only the employees who stick around for the long haul should have stock in the company. While I believe that’s shortsighted, there are merits to this line of thinking as it rewards employees for longer-term commitments. If companies are going to give 7 years after you leave to exercise, it seems that employees should be willing to give a little on the vesting side. Sam Altman talks about a method of backloading vesting A few other random thoughts. My goal here was to spur debate about these topics and to improve the situation for both startup employees and companies. Even though I plan to advocate and implement these practices moving forward, I’m certainly not in a position to mandate what others should do. But I would argue that if you’re thinking of joining a company that doesn’t adhere to similar principles, you should definitely think twice before joining them!One option that was suggested on Twitter was as follows: as they did with SAFE docs, Y Combinator is in a position to do something about this. Another proposal was to add fields to AngelList’s recruiting site and let the free market take over. I think both of these would be steps in the right direction.Also, for those who haven’t seen it, Thanks to the VCs and angels who reviewed this post (you know who you are!).

Last but most important one- Design, empathy at Musings from people building Mammoth

Remember But what really went wrong? And what can the Colors of today — hot startups generating huge funding of their own — do to avoid a similar fate? Looking at Back in 2008, for instance, we soft-launched Hootsuite with what was really a minimum viable product — a basic, rather hastily assembled app for managing multiple social media accounts. When thousands of people signed up in the first weeks, we decided to dedicate a team of engineers to build out the new tool. We tweaked it based on customer input and ran data tests to see which features were really in demand. Only then, when we knew we were actually onto something, did the question of outside funding enter the picture.On the other hand, if your industry is poised for growth, the competition is threatening to outpace you or you urgently need capital to grow and stay in the game, then it’s time to look into financing options. This was the case with Hootsuite. After launching, we bootstrapped for a year, but the clock was ticking and we were moving in slow motion. Competing social media management products were hitting the market and Facebook and Twitter were going from dorm-room curiosities to mainstream tools. Meanwhile, it was becoming clear that scaling and monetizing our tool would be capital intensive. So in 2009, one year after launching, we secured a $1.9-million Series A round.What we didn’t do, however, was change our underlying philosophy on spending. We were determined to remain capital efficient. So our new office space was anything but glamorous — filled with used furniture in an aging warehouses on the wrong side of the tracks in Vancouver. We didn’t spend on gala launch parties and our salespeople traveled on the cheap. And, since traditional advertising is so costly, we continually pushed ourselves to find alternative ways to boost our product’s exposure. My favorite: A When Hootsuite was able to secure its We were able to buy homes in the community. We were able to ensure that existing needs for our families were attended to. We were actually able to enjoy the fruits of our labor. And this meant that, rather than just desperately racing towards the payday that comes with an early exit, we could instead turn our attention to a longer-term vision — steadily building a multi-billion-dollar company.CEO 

A year ago I co-founded and began to operate a startup accelerator. That means that I’ve advised startups on everything from their customer segments to the way their monetize to getting distribution and raising money. I also prepared founders to be able to pitch to an audience.I have ripped apart quite a few startup pitches in private. And along the way I’ve also judged at a lot of pitch events.I had just heard five pitches from early-stage companies. There was one that still stays in my mind. The founder had the start of a viable business. He was going door to door selling his service with pretty good results and had access to valuable data that people wanted to buy.I’ve never seen anyone so bad. He was expressionless and boring. I didn’t know what he looked like afterward because he read verbatim from a sheet of paper held up to his face.But he was the only one there that day with a business. A boring business, but a good one. And he was also the one immediately ruled out as a contender. He’s still in business today (I checked up on him). Not so sure about the others.Pitch events are the fast food restaurants of the startup world. Easy to leave feeling full, but not that nutritious.If anything, pitch events reinforce the wrong message — that the best place to tell your story is in front of other startup people. That companies can be adequately judged by the way they present themselves, in a few minutes. And that entertaining an audience is as important as figuring out your business.They are much more often distractions from working on your business. Startups I’ve prepared to pitch spend lots of time practicing and figuring out what to communicate and how to express it. I’m relentless when it comes to making them better.These events rarely end with offers of funding. There is even a Your customers are probably not other startup people or the judges, so why spend so much time in front of these groups?I get inquiries like the below email from time to time, either asking me to judge or help find startups to pitch at someone’s event.I usually respond like this.There are entire business models based around convincing startups to spend time pitching at events, getting sponsorship and then selling on top of that things like tickets, conferences, research, or “access” to investors, whatever that means.And that’s a problem. This encourages a narcissistic way of thinking, where we socially reward the cool and the sexy instead of the sustainable. I used to have a cool startup (which wasn’t a great business) and I kicked butt at pitching, so I’m biased here. But the fifteen minutes of startup fame usually end abruptly when the lights go out at the event.By that I mean that the pitches make startups sound better than they are (You should be putting that effort into meeting your customers, experimenting, selling. Not adding noise to the startup ecosystem echo chamber.That is playing at running a startup, not actually doing it.Judging at these events is a haphazard business, where judgments are ill-informed or influenced by outspoken participants.And I know, because I’ve been able to influence who made it to the top most times.There are a couple of reasons.If you want to eradicate a practice, then it’s best to replace it with something else. Here are some ideas for eradicating pitch events.If you think pitch events are more distraction than good, please share this. And if you’d like to stay updated, I have a After a lot of positive responses, I expanded on this and other topics in a book called Professor of entrepreneurship at USC. Runs StartUSC.com.

I suppose this needs a little pre-story…In September 2013 the idea was born to introduce crowdfunding to the travel industry. To validate the idea we launched a simple splash page introducing crowdfunding for travelers: “Plan an extraordinary trip and get it funded by inspired people, amazed friends and generous sponsors”. Interested users were prompted to leave their e-mail if they want to try it out when we launch.I put my last $10 on Facebook ads to measure the conversion rate. Every second visitor was leaving his e-mail address - 50% conversion. To avoid spending more money on ads, we implemented referral mechanics — share the link on social media and get $50 towards your first trip (with a minimum raising amount of $1,000 per trip and a requirement to reach that minimum, this offer would simply eat our commission, which was between 5% and 9%).That’s when we got the first spike - 70,000 sign-ups in 3 days, mainly from India and Europe. After that sign-ups started slowing down, and we started receiving e-mails from people asking when they will get access. That gave us an idea to implement a queue.The queue’s purpose was simply to divide everyone into 3 batches — if you invited more than 3 people through your referral link, you’d be in the first batch to get access to the website. If you invited exactly 3 people, you’d be in the second batch, less than 3 — third batch. And that’s when it exploded. To heat things up a bit, we added a counter on the splash page saying how many people signed up in the last 24 hours. The record was 105,000. All in all we signed up around 400,000 people in just 2 weeks.The majority of sign-ups were from North America (35%), followed by Europe (29%) and Asia (22%).We were fortunate enough to quickly raise seed round from a group of local investors (14 in total — mainly Angels, plus one VC). For $70,000 USD we gave away 30% of the company — welcome to start-up life in South Africa. Later on we proceeded to raise a follow-on round of $80,000 USD, all in all raising $150,000 and Now it’s time to build an outstanding product. Between giving interviews to the likes of The Wall Street Journal, Yahoo! and others, as well as managing some interest from the massive brands in the USA and Europe (including fast-food chains, airlines and hotels), we were frantically building the first beta and released it on January 3, 2014.From there — feature after feature, after feature, hundreds of different strategies, approaches and ideas on how to grow the business. In 2014 alone we launched 3 new versions of Trevolta. In reality we hit the ceiling on both user growth and revenue growth. Around 100 sign-ups on a good day, and $24,000 in trip contributions per month. No matter what we did, we could not make those numbers grow. To date we processed $385,000 USD through the system — not much for crowdfunding industry, but enough to make some travel dreams come true.In September 2014 we made an attempt to raise investment in the US and set-up our presence there — that would give us flexibility in setting-up the structure of the business right, and also put us face to face with the brands we were in communication with over e-mails and Skype. All those brands wanted to get involved as trip sponsors in one way or another, but inability to meet in person didn’t help either — weird team from South Africa trying to do something that no one has ever done before.Here comes catch 22 — we needed to raise capital to set up presence in USA, but in order to raise capital in USA, we already needed to be incorporated there. In the eyes of the foreign investors our shareholding and business structure also didn’t look right — founders lost control over the company that was operating under SA tax laws with it’s IP residing in SA as well.Given we had an impressive month to month growth, it probably would have been easier. In reality it was meeting after meeting after meeting, pitch after pitch, investor deck after investor deck, projections after projections. Ending 2014 till mid 2015 was all about fundraising.Business ran out of money by November 2014, and since then in good faith founders have been funding the operations themselves.Failing to raise a debt round in SA, founders of the company resigned in May 2015. To summarize our experience, and as a reminder to myself when I build a new venture, this is what I’ve learned:All in all, that was an amazing experience. We helped some awesome travelers to realize their dreams. We got involved in saving South African rhinos from extinction. We worked with over 56 brands on sponsoring some trips and running campaigns, including Hampton Inn, Samsung and Hertz. We met some awesome people, and leveled up our entrepreneural skills.Where to from here? It’s time to live the life we’re preaching — on 28 of September two founders of Trevolta are going on an indefinite trip to explore the world, while working remotely and preparing the launch of something new (Trevolta was just the beginning…). If you happen to be a high-growth start-up and believe we can add value to what you do, shoot me a note.Love  Light,Entrepreneur, full stack web-developer, public speaker.

I remember attending the first Nasscom Product Conclave in 2007.It was a small intimate affair that brought together folks from product companies who openly shared their learnings and experiences with one another. The organizers themselves were founders of product companies as were all the speakers.As a founder of a fledgling product company myself, I found the experience akin to taking an invigorating walk on the Bellandur lakeside - a convivial gathering of peers aided by a bracing draft of transparent learnings and fresh insights.I remember attending the Nasscom Product Conclave in 2012.It was to put it mildly, a mindless frenzy - a grotesquely over-the-top carnival celebrating every possible excess abounding in the Indian startup ecosystem.I was struck by how far the event had strayed from its founding ideals - what was once an idyllic lake was now polluted beyond recognition.As the ninth edition of the Nasscom Product Conclave kicked off in Bangalore, I couldn’t help noticing how its degradation mirrors that of the Bellandur lake. A fomenting miasma that is only 5% water and 95% sewage and pollutants…the toxic foam runoff a silent but eloquent reminder of how far the event has fallen.As far as I can tell, Nasscom Product Conclave was originally conceived to serve as a platform for showcasing Indian product companies.In 2012, I was offered an opportunity to launch my product at the event. Despite the rich price tag for entering the event, I decided to take up this opportunity as it seemed like a great platform to announce a product and get some media visibility and nuanced feedback from experts. However the actual experience was a disaster.Rather than showcasing the product launches in the main hall, I was shepherded into a small dark room in an obscure corner of the hotel where the only other folks in attendance were my fellow founder saps who were launching their own products! There were a couple of other unaffiliated audience members but I suspect there were here primarily to catch up on a few winks away from the hustle and bustle of the main hall.What was in the main hall?That was where Mahesh Murthy held court about how one can hack travel and see the world on a shoestring budget.Which of course, was precisely what one would hope to learn in a conclave about tech products!This was all the more tragic because Mahesh is an incredible raconteur but more than that, he has a wealth of knowledge on products and management that would have been far more valuable to this audience.This pandering to frivolous and sexy topics over substantial but unsexy product aspects is a common occurrence across NPC editions.This year, the choice of sessions and speakers is even more bizarre.For instance, there is one from a representative of the Estonian government (unsurprisingly a sponsor).But the one that takes the cake is one that features the redoubtable Alok Kejriwal and his gang of gurus pontificating about the art of living/winning!While I would find it mind-boggling, I won’t be surprised if the folks at Nasscom claim that such sessions are an attempt to provide a “syncretic, holistic” perspective towards life in general. In which case, why maintain the pretence that this event is about products at all?The other thing that I notice about NPC is that it has now become the epitome of an old boys clubs, exclusionist and discriminatory. Where participation is determined by not what you know but who you know.Successive episodes of NPC largely feature the same set of speakers speaking about the same set of things usually about topics that have little to do with products per se.This sense of circle-jerking permeates through the overall event and with things like invite-only dinners that only the privileged few can attend.While the product startups largely get the short shrift within the event, thankfully there is one part where accomplished startups are called out and recognized.This is in the form of the “Emerge 10” award that is conferred during the course of the NPC.This year’s winners are covered here:While the entire process of selecting these companies is rather opaque, that is not a major sin in itself and is par for the course as far as startup awards go in India.What is irksome is that there are some glaring conflicts of interest that carry the faint stench of cronyism.For instance, two of the ten companies selected this year are the portfolio companies of one of the VCs sponsoring the event.Even more glaring is that three of these companies are ones in which the chairman of the Nasscom Product Council has a vested interest.The first is a company which is part of the accelerator this gentleman was previously a part of.The second is one in which he is an advisor.And the third is one in which he is an investor! While the press note completely glosses over these affiliations for the first two companies, for the third one, it is mentioned in passing. This particular company is just a year old and one that very few in the ecosystem have heard of and it is moot if this company has done anything that merits a “India’s hottest startup” tag.In my opinion, the biggest way in which Nasscom has been remiss with respect to the event is that it has abrogated its responsibility as the flagbearer for the Indian software product community. From being a body that lobbied selflessly for the small but ambitious product fraternity, it has degenerated into a figleaf self-serving entity whose presence is only felt in conferences and junkets that prey on unsuspecting newbie entrepreneurs.Much like Bellandur Lake, the rot is deep and true.An average joe entrepreneur tilting away at the windmills from Beantown, India

Trouver la « billion-dollar idea »…. À écouter ceux qui désirent se lancer mais n’osent pas encore, cela semble être le point de départ déterminant. Tant qu’ils ne sont pas certains de l’avoir découverte, ils continuent de se remuer les méninges… ou de se tourner les pouces ;)Autant d’aprioris basés sur ce mythe : une startup commence par une idée. Que cela soit clair : Une aventure entrepreneuriale ne commence pas par une idée mais par un problème. Il y a quelque chose qui vous empêche de bien dormir la nuit, quelque chose qui vous obsède.A TheFamily, on s’intéresse aux startups scalables — des sociétés dites technologiques aux coûts variables très faibles.Les meilleures startups sont celles qui créent leur propre catégorie. Elles tentent d’investir un marché qui n’existe pas encore, mais qui, une fois lancé, viendra perturber les industries établies.L’innovation réside dans un changement de paradigme ( pas forcément dans une percée technologique, comme expliqué plus haut).Airbnb n’est pas l’idée de trouver une chambre chez l’habitant. Les fondateurs ne se sont pas dit : “Et si on renversait l’industrie de l’hôtellerie et de l’immobilier ? ”. Ils ont attaqué de front un problème donné : celui de trouver un lieu où dormir.Si Hollywood ne sait pas prédire le futur, c’est parce que les scénaristes de science-fiction cherchent des idées qui semblent plausibles aujourd’hui. C’est facile d’imaginer une voiture volante, mais personne n’a vu venir Uber !D’abord, vous vous assurez que le problème existe réellement pour vous.Si une startup ne marche pas, c’est qu’elle fabrique quelque chose dont tout le monde se fout. Nul besoin de chercher trop longtemps : quand un problème compte, cela saute aux yeux.Plutôt que de proposer quelque chose que tout le monde veut un peu, offrez une solution qu’un petit nombre de gens veulent désespérément.Une niche est un excellent point de départ parce que vos utilisateurs seront prêts à tout pour obtenir votre solution, même si elle n’est pas encore au point.Le risque n’est pas d’être confiné à une niche à terme, c’est de ne pas avoir essayé de bâtir quelque chose qui compte.L’opportunité entrepreneuriale se trouve à l’intersection des bonnes et des mauvaises idées.D’un côté, les bonnes idées sont dominées par les grandes entreprises, donc hors de votre portée. De l’autre, la majorité des idées sont simplement… mauvaises !Si vous êtes attaché à une idée, vous ne saurez pas de quel côté elle se trouve. Alors que si vous tentez de résoudre un problème, vous pouvez réitérer jusqu’à trouver le juste milieu.Un entrepreneur se doit d’avoir une vision. Les personnes qui vivent dans le futur sont généralement optimistes, enthousiastes, imperméables à la critique… Bref, vivre dans le futur vous donne un avantage psychologique formidable par rapport au reste du monde.Nuance : il n’est pas question ici de s’acharner sur des prévisions à 50 ans d’horizon ! Restez conscients que le timing et le contexte sont des facteurs extrêmement importants dans la réussite d’une startup.Il y a plusieurs facettes à cette règle, mais elle se résume à un principe :Ce n’est pas parce que d’autres proposent déjà votre solution qu’il ne faut pas se lancer. Le « first mover advantage » n’existe pas, c’est plutôt l’inverse. Le premier commet toutes les erreurs avant tout le monde… et se voit rafler le monopole par le dernier venu !Les marchés fragmentés, bien que saturés de propositions de valeurs, présentent une réelle opportunité. Pourquoi ? La fragmentation, c’est justement un problème en soi !Enfin, n’imaginez pas qu’il faut un énorme budget marketing pour se démarquer des autres. Vous n’avez pas besoin de com’ pour réussir. Il vous faut simplement un problème rencontré par une niche qui vous est accessible.Pour finir, n’essayez pas de lancer le prochain Twitter : 1.000+ projets ont déjà façonné leur ambition et changé leur vision de lentrepreneuriat. Koudetat les meilleurs cours en ligne pour réussir sa boîte.Anyone can become an entrepreneur.

Many tech companies in the Bay Area, like Twitter and Airbnb, use improv as a tool for team building and professional development. It’s a great way to teach employees to get out of their comfort zones and learn to deal with new and unexpected changes.Recently at We were led by John from Secret Improv Society who guided us through a set of fun team-building activities.Going into the event, I wasn’t exactly sure how improv could prepare us for startup life, but after spending two hours practicing improv, I could start to see how.Here are the major themes I noticed:Startups are naturally uncertain environments.A startup’s course of direction can change at any moment, and as a team, you have to be able to move together.In improv, a story or situation can change on a whim. Your partner may suddenly take the story in a different direction, and you have to be ready to adapt to the situation.A key part of managing these situations is to be more willing to accept the uncertainty and work together through it.Improv is just another word for “live collaboration”.At the start of our session, John taught us a key concept of improv called the “Yes, And” rule.The “Yes” part of the rule tells you to accept your partner’s idea, and the “And” part tells you to add something to it. This guideline puts you in the mindset of building off each other’s ideas instead of trying to shut them down.Startups that thrive learn to take advantage of this principle. When ideas aren’t constantly being shut down, people are more likely to contribute if they don’t fear being criticized.Communication is a vital aspect of any team.In improv, you’re taught to listen actively to your team so that you can quickly pick up on cues. Every now and then, you’ll find someone who worries too much about what they’re going to say, and as a result be distracted from what their teammates are trying to communicate to them.In startup teams, you have to learn to listen actively in order to really understand what someone is communicating to you. Teams that fail to collaborate suffer due to a lack of understanding each other’s ideas.Learning how to effectively communicate in a team environment helps you get your ideas across to others.But if you’re introverted like me, you’ll sometimes find it difficult to clearly communicate what you want to say.When you participate in improv, you’ll find that a lot of the activities force you to say what is on your mind without thinking too much about it.This is good practice for those who tend to be quiet. You’ll find that it gets you in the habit of being more comfortable saying what’s on your mind.In order to develop yourself or your startup, you need to learn to push yourself past your comfort zone and do things that scare you.Improv is great practice for doing things that make you feel uncomfortable. For most people, the uncertainty of being in improv situations makes them feel worried about putting themselves out there.I went in feeling uncomfortable about exposing myself in front of others and came out feeling more confident with being vulnerable around others.Great startup founders know that failure is an integral part of success.Establishing a culture of acknowledging failure creates an environment where people iterate their way to success through feedback and learning.Early on during our improv session, we went through an activity where everyone yelled out “I failed!” every time someone messed up. This exercise made everyone feel more comfortable with the idea of failure.You’ll be surprised at how much value you can get out of doing improv. The experience taught me a lot about working with others in the face of risk and uncertainty.If you’re in the Bay Area, there are tons of opportunities to get out of your comfort zone.

I’m a 24-year-old self-taught designer. I’ve been freelancing for 6 years. I’ve always combined freelancing with building my own products. I love designing and executing my own ideas. My side projects— mostly iOS apps — have been featured on The Next Web, The Verge, Product Hunt, Lifehacker, Mashable, TechCrunch and many more.I joined a startup called After our first meeting we could already start working on our first ideas for Blendle. All of us believed in the direction and we continued exploring — It felt like working on one of our side projects. I started designing and for the first 1 to 2 months not much happened. I stumbled upon problems, I tried solving them. All fine.Then the feedback came. “Can you use the same buttons as the ones on the website? We need more orange. It needs more Mario-feeling.” All things I couldn’t agree on. I felt like we had a very different vision. I tried focussing on the feedback I could relate to and fix them within the boundaries of my vision.Another month went by and the distance between Alexander and I increased. Alexander made suggestions and I told him why these weren’t the solution we should be looking for. We both got frustated. I felt I wasn’t been taken serious — if you hire me, you should have more faith in me. I didn’t feel valued. We had to talk.I told Alexander how I felt about all of this. But I hadn’t thoroughly thought about his feelings. I could figure he was frustrated, but I was too. “I just want you to try my solution as well”, Alexander said when we finally sat down. I’ve been thinking about that a lot. Why did I not want to try his solution? It turns out Sometimes I still have to keep in mind we won’t ship something I’m not okay with. It makes it way easier designing things you’re not sold on. And in the end, people might take your word if you think a solution sucks. But don’t be so arrogant, they need to grow trust on you. I worried way too much about shipping poor solutions. We haven’t shipped a damn detail that I, or anyone else, is not fully behind on. And yes, I’ve made a lot of ugly things.The workflow at a startup is different. You’re iterating way more. But in combination with working on your own projects— when you can ship a lot of different things whenever you feel confident — working at a startup is awesome!In my time as a fulltime freelancer I hired a shared office space just because I needed more human interaction. I worked from 13:00 till 03:00 barely seeing anyone. Well, sometimes I went to a really pathetic bar just to have some face-2-face interactions. Having colleagues is great.I really enjoy make the company grow, together with my colleagues. And when combining this with building side-projects and working for clients I’m still able to ship a lot of different things.👊Mobile Product Designer at Blendle. Always working on a side project.

…that all accredited investors can participate in RIGHT NOW! With it, I will be backing high-potential startups who have I have access to all types of great founders and all types of awesome deals. But I believe that there is a unique opportunity to fund high-potential companies led by underrepresented founders who are of color, female, and/or LGBT (and I am proud to be all 3!). Companies founded by white males have historically received ~92% of all venture capital funding. Diversity has proven to be lucrative, yet traditional VC pattern-matching is leaving billions of unrealized returns on the table.In my blog post ‘In the past few weeks we’ve seen Google Ventures add two black investment partners, the White House held its first Demo Day and a ton of VC firms pledged to invest in more diversity there, the Kapors committed $40mil to invest in diverse founders, and Intel continues to be a strong leader. Several companies like Airbnb, Slack, Twitter, Uber, and Dropbox are divulging more stats and hiring people to lead diversity initiatives that speak to the culture of their companies in an effort to retain, and (hopefully) not just bloat their employee statistic numbers or meet a quota.Though a natural skeptic (what great emerging investor isn’t?), I am hopeful.So I asked myself: “What can I do to make a clear and present impact and be part of the change I wanted to see, and NOW? And also…make a ton of scrilla cause diversity is LUCRATIVE…” I have no personal wealth and breaking into the venture world is so highly competitive. I did receive a couple of interesting offers after my blog post in June, but to be frank, even the serious ones weren’t offering a salary, so I had to turn them down in order to eat. Girl needs her string cheese, ya feel me?So I decided to do a major hack and carve out a role for myself In Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, there’s a lot of capital flowing, but I have some pretty awesome deal flow. It comes from a combination of being lucky and working really hard to build my network and be a value-add over the last 3 years. I try to be a good listener (still working on it) and help founders whenever I can, and as my friend and advisor On a personal note, it could provide a really wonderful training ground for someone like me with a…let’s say…‘unique’ background:) It’s true: I don’t have an investment track record. I will be learning and growing while building my syndicate.The next few days, months, and years will certainly bring new challenges. I will be humbled more than a few times. But I’m up for the challenge, incentivized to succeed in this space (if I do well, others do well, and vice versa), and am beyond excited to see what this journey will be like. I’m fortunate to have dozens of people who are in tech and venture helping me learn along the way and providing a real world education for me daily.If you make at least $200k/year or have $1mil in wealth (not including your main home’s value), you are considered an accredited investor in the U.S. and you can sign up to invest as little as $1k (or as much as $100k+) in As I reveal deals, I’ll share with syndicate backers some info about the companies, teams, and whatever metrics the founders make available. You’ll then be able to decide if you want to invest on a deal by deal basis. Signing up to the syndicate costs nothing up front. It’s just a way to say ‘yes, I’ll back it for x amount if there are any deals I like.’I will be investing money in every deal I syndicate (by definition and design), so I’ll have skin in the game, too. This will be a small amount usually equal to 1% of the total allocation, since under SEC regulations up to 100 people can invest in each deal. What’s in it for me besides the potential returns on the direct investment is that I get what’s called a “carry” or “carried interest” on anything that returns a profit to the syndicate.I’m looking at this as a long-game play. Perhaps in 3–10 years I can make a significant amount of money off of carry in these early investments (again, this is all hope, since, you guessed it: investing is risky and unpredictable). So it stands to reason that I’m going to be looking for the best and the brightest founders and companies to raise my/our chances of a return.Another thing to note is that as far as I can tell, I am the first black female to lead a syndicate on Angel List. It gives me goosebumps to just type that out. It’s both exhilarating and infuriating. I love being the first at almost anything cause I’m competitive as hell:) But I also hope to be one of So guys, let’s change the ratio. Let’s make some big moves. If you’re a dude, a chick, straight, gay, black, Latino, Asian, white, pink or purple (no serious, P!nk, call me!) accredited investor, and you want to see some checks written and capital pumped into a new and exciting ecosystem, and If you’re not accredited (yet!) but still want to see the deals I bring in so you can check out cool companies with diverse founders, don’t worry! I will also try to do short interviews with founders of each of the companies after each deal, and will post them here.

At eFounders, we build 3 to 4 SaaS startups a year. Our process is to develop our business ideas inside our startup studio; once an idea is validated and falls under our “People will take your solution if they need it and if they perceive that what you offer is significantly better than what they have today. Rather than asking people if they like your solution, you need to understand what they really need and to appreciate whether your solution brings enough value to the table to make them change their current habit. The main advantage of this method is that it brings a quantitative dimension to a usually very qualitative phase.Your goal is to interview 20 people you think are your target, using face-to-face or phone interviews. The goal of this interview is to Your questions should enable you to understand:The interviews are a unique occasion to scope this need by asking as many details as possible (how often they use their current solution, why they use it, what are its limits).Specifically ask the client how he/she perceives the price, the quality, the performance and the convenience of the solution she/he is currently using. The definition of these four criteria depends on the context (see example below), be sure to bring your own context to your questions.* Price: purchase fee, setup, fee, subscription fee, license fee* Quality: relevance of results, infrastructure availability, customer service quality* Performance: response time, delivery time, travel speed, quantity of items, number of results* Convenience: easy to use, easy to carry on, easy to park, easy to access, easy to orderThe goal of the exercise is to define for every of theses dimensions if they are perceived asYou should do the same exercise with your own idea. For every dimension you should determine if your solution makesYou can then calculate the PCV (Perceived Created Value) which defines the value that your solution brings relatively to what your client perceives. You can calculate your PCV by rating you and your client’s answersa)-answers = 0 point,b)-answers = 1 pointc)-answers = 3 pointsPCV is the sum of the value created on 4 dimensions (Price, Quality, Performance, Convenience) weighted by the importance that your client dedicates to each of these dimensions. This score depends on the people your are interviewing and should be considered in average. A score of 7 is a great score and should mean that the created value is higher than the cost of change (in algebra, it can be defined by the dot product of the 2 vectors Perceived Values and Created Values).Some example of good PCV:PCV: 0*0 + 0*0 + 3*3 + 0*0 = 9PCV : 1* 1 + 1*1 + 0*0 + 3*3 = 11PCV : 3*1+3*1+1*1+1*3 = 10PCV : 0*1 + 1*1 + 1*3 + 1*3 = 7Interviews have to be conducted as honestly as possible since we know that we all are capable of convincing ourselves of almost anything. This methodology is worth what it’s worth, but the worst thing that can happen is you lose a few hours talking with future potential clients, discovering a lot about their problems and having a better overview of the competitive landscape!Thank you Rachel Vanier, Pascaline Bertaux, Sacha Schmitz and Cyril Gantzer for reviewing this article.Founder Together with entrepreneurs, we turn unique ideas into successful companies.

My story starts in college. It starts with labels and expectations. I was a teenage computer science major who had just been awarded a prestigious internship at the university’s web department. They were in charge of maintaining everything from the public website to proprietary web-applications used by tens of thousands of students and faculty. Nearly every intern who passed through the program went on to work at companies like Yahoo or Google, and if they didn’t they started their own. Receiving that internship was my ticket to great things and I was just getting started.I quickly made friends with my manager, who took an interest in me because of my constant need to be building something. I always had a second workspace setup and when things slowed down I’d spend my spare time tinkering with my own creations while other interns browsed Facebook. It was around this time that he asked me to start pitching our department my ideas, so once a week he’d call everyone to attention and give me the floor. I have to admit, this was a tremendous boost to my ego as he never did this with anyone else. I started to feel more like a supervisor than an intern and I was awarded more hours and responsibilities.About half-way through my internship, I built my first company. It was one of the first truly hosted VoIP service providers. Unlike other offerings at the time, you could sign-up and provision your phones directly from the web-portal rather than needing to call a sales agent. Although we largely remained a local service-provider, our user base swelled to several thousand end-points. Eventually, this attracted the attention of a large managed service provider who acquired my infrastructure and client base. This led to new nicknames around the department like “Jobs” and “Zuck.” I was told I was destined for great things, that they couldn’t wait to see my name on the thirty under thirty and that I’d be a millionaire in my twenties.I built and sold two more applications, but I always sold too early. I never received an offer above five figures, but I always accepted because I was typically bored by that point. Right after I sold the third one, I was approached by a very successful local entrepreneur. Apparently, he was impressed with my work and wanted to know if I’d consider teaming up with him for my next venture. This was uncharted territory for me; although I was always building something, I did it alone. I didn’t like the idea of managing a business partnership on top of an application. Business partners liked meetings and in my mind, meetings were the enemy of productivity.Against my better judgment, I decided to say yes. Wow, was this different. I was instantly swarmed with paperwork; operating agreements, partnership agreements, equity distribution agreements, investment guidelines, vesting agreements and on and on. I hadn’t even started building the application yet and he was already pitching investors. Once the first investment was secured, the real nightmare began. My business partner had a habit of disappearing for weeks on end only to magically reappear at our next investor meeting. Once we’d secured more money he’d drop out of touch again, which left me to effectively have to manage a massive project all by myself. If he did show up, I’d have to spend hours trying to explain to him everything he’d missed rather than actually working on the project.The dark days as I like to call them, consisted of me often working eighteen to twenty hours a day. I dreamt of nothing but code and organizing layers in photoshop. We were a few weeks away from making it. As useless as my business partner was, he was really good at pitching our product. He had just secured over half-a-million dollars for us in Series A and all we had to do now was cross some T’s and dot some I’s. At least that’s what he thought.As the deadline approached, my mood deteriorated until I was a shell of my former self. I started to hate getting up in the morning, everything began to feel like it took tens times the effort. I started snapping at people and having panic attacks on the way to board meetings. Why was this happening? I had a nice house, an expensive car, a six-figure salary, a beautiful girlfriend and I was the CEO of my own fucking company, all by the time I was twenty-five. Wasn’t this everything I always wanted? Wasn’t this everything that was expected of me? It seemed with every step forward I got further and further from happiness; I got miserable. What was wrong with me?As the meeting drew closer, I started avoiding everyone. I knew that if I signed that agreement, I was going to be locked into doing this for the foreseeable future. My ever-unavailable business partner suddenly started calling me dozens of times a day and I sent every single one of them to voicemail. Sometimes I’d leave my house and just walk aimlessly around my neighborhood for hours at a time, trying to figure out what I wanted. I knew that I didn’t want things to stay the way they were, but I also couldn’t see an alternative — anything else just seemed like taking a step backward.The day before the meeting, I awoke with remarkable clarity. I sat down on my computer and started drawing up an exit agreement while simultaneously transferring ownership of important assets to my business partner. With every stroke of the keyboard and every mouse click, I felt a growing sense of freedom and a surprising lightness in my thoughts. This wasn’t the grim decision I was expecting it to be, but rather it was utterly liberating. A huge smile consumed my face as I clicked send. I knew that I was about to lose everything and I didn’t care.The meeting was a somber affair, at least for them. I on the other hand, bounced into the room like a kid on the last day of school before summer vacation. The amount they offered for my majority share of equity was a joke. I haggled a bit and walked away with less than half of my yearly salary, but I took it and smiled. My business partner didn’t smile, in fact, he was fuming. When we left the meeting he berated me in front of a crowded restaurant, calling me “lazy” and threatening to sue me for everything I had. I bit my lip to restrain jubilant laughter from bursting forth as he turned beet red. He spat a few choice expletives at me as he turned and stormed down the street.When I arrived at my car, I patted it gently on the spoiler and laughed uncontrollably: I’d be selling it shortly. I hopped in, lit a cigarette and blasted Cee Lo’s “Fuck You” with the windows down all the way home. For the first time in years, I had absolutely no idea what I was going to be doing tomorrow and I liked it. I could take it back to the basics, I could create for the simple thrill of creating. I was well aware that this was only the spark that would start the inferno, and I was about to watch my entire world burn down around me. Good, I was actually looking forward to it with gleeful anticipation.The next week was a complete blur. I wasn’t naive enough to believe that suddenly everything would be kittens and moonbeams. I knew that there would be a somewhat massive adjustment period before everything fell into place, before I could figure out exactly what my next move was. I had to sell my house and I had to sell my car. I had to hire a lawyer when my business partner followed through on his threat; thankfully the case was dismissed. My girlfriend of seven years left me, apparently she really didn’t like my life plan anymore. I think she was happier when it was more of my money and less of myself. I couldn’t blame her though, she had wanted it as badly as I had, it wasn’t her fault I’d changed the playbook at the eleventh hour. The funny thing is, the more I let go, the freer I felt. With each thing that was taken from me, I gained back more of what I’d lost.It took me some time to piece everything together, to dissect my experience and extract something useful from it. I did a lot of reading, a lot of walking and a whole lot of soul-searching. I came to love a quote from the philosopher Martin Heidegger who said:Even if I tried I couldn’t have written my own experience as eloquently as he did. My whole life I had allowed my fears and the expectations of others to set the frontiers of my own destiny. I never took time to actually ask myself:Nor did I realize how much those expectations of others had caused me so much unhappiness. When ideas of grandiosity and entitlement are spoken to you constantly, each failure feels like it weighs a thousand pounds. Why wasn’t I living up to what people thought I would become? Did I actually want to become that or did I want to be something else altogether? Fear kept me from letting go, fear of losing all of these things I thought mattered so much. It’s only now that I realize how little those things actually matter to me. I spend my days now reading, writing, meditating, walking, volunteering and using my skills to help non-profits and social entrepreneurial programs. I make about a third of what I used to and I’ve never been happier; it was the price for buying back my life.

Since a few months, I am a free man again. After 5 years of very hard work, Allmyapps was sold at the end of 2014. It has been an incredible journey, but it has also been an incredibly tough one. The story of Allmyapps is the story of most startups: the ones that do not make it to the Unicorn club, far from it, but still fought all they could trying to get there.Allmyapps started with a big and global ambition: to become the #1 App Store for Windows PC. Even though we eventually failed in our mission to become the #1 App Store for Windows PC, we’ve learned tremendously along the way and I think it would be a waste not to share this experience.This post is the first step towards sharing this experience. However, being a very bad (and slow!) writer, don’t expect me to write lengthy posts anytime soon: Presentations are the maximum you can expect from me.If you went through the slides, you may be wondering how do I feel a few months after this experience. Well, not bad at all actually! Even though, this adventure has not been a success money-wise, I still feel some sense of accomplishment for not having quit and for eventually having succeeded in selling the company.I would not have said that right after the sale though as it’s been pretty tough to switch overnight from full pressure, full activity, max adrenaline to… nothing. But after a few months of resting, enjoying relaxing time with my wife and taking some well-deserved vacations, I now feel readier than ever for my new venture!Working on the most important thing in the world I could be working on. Previously CEO of Allmyapps.

When I ask startup folk if they have a “Marketing Plan” I get a range of reactions from a slightly embarrassed “Yeah we probably should have one but we aren’t doing much marketing so…” through to the more assertive, “We don’t do plans, because we’re like, you know, a startup!”At my first startup we didn’t have a marketing plan. We were a small team working on short-term tactical projects. Those tactics changed every week or two and we didn’t see a need to document anything. My first encounter with a marketing plan came after we were acquired by a global company. The experience was awful. The plan was done yearly and had 50 sections, starting with a (completely arbitrary) revenue goal and drilling all the way down to every specific tactic (including PR, email, advertising, events, everything) to be executed across the entire year. The most frightful thing about the Marketing plan was that it wasn’t approved until March, and by June we’d started building the plan for the following year. The exercise seemed pointless to me.At my next startup however, I found that there were moments when I missed pieces of that marketing plan. I missed having a work plan that tied the schedules for content creation, campaign execution and sales enablement together. I missed having the clarity of approved campaign components like well-defined target markets, messaging and goals (at least for the next month or so), and I found I needed a revenue model that mapped my lead generation plan to expected revenue. I wanted a plan that kept the good bits of the big company plan and threw out the useless stuff. I’ve done marketing plans ever since. Interestingly, most of the good startup marketing VP’s I know do similar stripped-down planning. Here are the common components I’ve seen across plans:Things are moving quickly at a startup and I’ve found it’s important to get agreement on the basic underpinnings of the marketing plan. This will save you from starting out with tactical execution, only to have everyone disagree later with the basics of copy or content. The first input is the company Positioning.I generally capture this in a The second input is a short Messaging document. This builds on the Positioning components and provides the baseline that will be used for copy and content in campaigns. My version of this is usually only a couple of pages at the most and covers:This is how you are tracking the list of programs, campaigns and experiments you have running at any given time. There are loads of tools you can use to keep track of this stuff but I use a spreadsheet with a bunch of tabs. I start with a tab for each major tactic group (such as PR, Events, Email, Social/Digital, Referral/Influencer, Website, inside sales calling, etc.). Each tab has a timeline of what is happening when, owners and due dates. Content crosses almost every tab so I usually have a master content plan on a separate tab so I can see exactly what content is being delivered when. Then I have a summary tab shows the master calendar across the month and the quarter.I generally have a bunch of experiments running as well (tests on parts of the website, tests on new acquisition channels, tests that are trying to streamline our lead to close process, email tests around timing or segmentation of the lists, etc.). Those are tracked separately and winners are folded into the plan.The last thing I’ve got is a Dashboard that is tracking results across all of my tactics against my targets. I’m usually showing results for what’s happening now but also a prediction of what the resulting revenue should look like based on my assumptions around conversion rates downstream. I’m also tracking my budget/spending across each tactic.This is essentially a predictive revenue model for the business. What happens if we drop events? What happens if we increase our spend by 5K on advertising? I can give you my best guess by changing the inputs on the model. I can also track the assumptions and model what a change in a conversion rate at any stage in my buying process will have on revenue (for example, if we increased trial to purchase conversion from 30% to 35%, what would be the lift on revenue?).Instrumenting this is sometimes a pain depending on where you are pulling data from. I usually end up with a master sheet in excel that’s pulling from whatever tools I’m using to capture metrics. The tools don’t matter as long as your report/dashboard is up to date and accurate.Most of what made my marketing planning experiences at big companies so painful was the timeframe (a year is eternity for an early stage startup) and the static nature of the plan. I am usually doing a review of my tactical plan every week or 2 to see if there are things we can pull in from our successful experiments or things that we might want to pull out because the results are falling behind other tactics. I also do a regular checkpoint on my inputs. Is the market shifting in a way that might impact my target segments? Have we learned anything that might indicate we need to shift our messaging or positioning? Static plans are useless for a startup — an agile planning process on the other hand is indispensable.Do you like this? Hit the recommend button!I do startup marketing and sales.

As a young art collector myself, I was inspired to build Kollecto through a personal frustration. I go to Spotify when I want recommendations for I figured there must be other people like me, who were interested in collecting art, but didn’t want to comb through hundreds of galleries and exhibits. So I built an app to give people affordable access to their own personal art buyer (fancy, right?).In the very early stages of building Kollecto, I was already stringing together various tools to build an MVP without needing to hire engineers. I had the idea for Kollecto floating around in my head, when I came across a side project bootcamp program called In the beginning, I used I’m a firm believer in releasing MVPs and iterating quickly, before devoting a ton of resources to a direction you’re not sure will stick. I was able to find out pretty quickly that Kollecto was something that not only my customers wanted, but that art advisors and galleries wanted too.By the time Kollecto was accepted into the 500 Startups Accelerator, we already had over 400 active users and around $30k in art sales. I continued to refine the code-free tools we leveraged, adding Stringing together a bunch of tools had worked well to this point, but once we hit ~1500 monthly active users things began to fall apart.The main issue was relying on human labor. Each time a new user signed up, an Art Advisor would have to manually find art for them. Then a virtual assistant would upload hundreds of art recommendations into our survey-based app. The process moved quickly when we had several hundreds users, but it was impossible to manage for thousands at once.At the most hectic moment, I remember starting to feel embarrassed of the product. There was a period where users had to wait 3 weeks for their first art recommendations.We had outgrown our ‘product’ and something had to give.About mid-way through the 500 Startups program, I came across Bubble on Product Hunt [sidenote: they were recently By the time I finished with 500 startups, I had a fully functioning app on Bubble! Now, instead of managing handfuls of tools — from website builders to form generators — everything I needed to manage was on one platform. We still used Art Advisors to categorize art using our internal taxonomy. But the crux of Kollecto’s functionality and ability to scale now rested on the art-matching algorithm; something that, before Bubble, was impossible to integrate without code.My advice to non-technical founders, or designers who are looking to quickly wireframe their ideas, or even coders who want to more quickly release an MVP before committing to a direction: try Learn about The Lean Startup Conference and Lean Startup methods here.

If you’re a first-time founder, it’s very hard to understand when the piece of advice Jack Dorsey, Steve Blank, your dad’s finance friend who invested in your company, uncle bob, or Elon Musk gave you is the most relevant.“You should follow your dreams and quit your job” could be a terrible piece of advice if you’re an 20 year old single mother with no financial support.“You should focus on the 20% of 80% of the results” is a direct contradiction to “be detail-oriented”. Yet, both are common pieces of advice in the startup community.“Make something people want”? Nope.When customers want a faster horse when they really need a car is the classic example that throws that core advice out the window.“Make something people want” is great advice There are countless articles on why The lack of context people fail to provide when giving advice leads to people getting pieces of advice that are directly conflicting.There is no right answer to anything.People who are searching for advice also need to stop viewing advice as their potential silver bullet.

After receiving that initial email from Sheel, we scheduled a call the following week. I remember two things about that initial call, Sheel talked about my “perfect” voice for radio for the first two minutes of the call (totally blowing smoke I’m sure). We chatted for about 30 minutes and decided to move forward with the idea of working together. Over the next few months we kept getting rejected by founders who wanted Sheel’s money, but didn’t want to broadcast their pitch on our podcast.We almost gave up on the idea about two months into it, but then on the 13th of May, I connected with Harry Stebbings (host of The Twenty Minute VC) for the first time, when he pitched So on the 13th of May, I started talking to everyone I knew about the idea. I was surprised by how excited everyone was about the idea.So we started working on the design of the website with the help of At the last minute, while Sheel and me were networking with other angel investors and VC’s with the hopes that they would support the show; I decided to head out to San Francisco to spend a week putting together the final pieces. Episodes 0, 1,  2 were all recorded during that week. Episode 0 titled The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with over 40 reviews in just 2 weeks of being on iTunes. People have described the show as well paced, fun, and educational. Investors seem to want the show to be longer, and cover more details of the startup, while founders and casual listeners say that what they love most about the show is that it shines the light on something that traditionally only happens behind closed doors.There are pitches from founders plastered all over the internet, but the feedback (the conversation) from investors after hearing the pitch is what’s most interesting and can help other founders learn the most. So we’re having to work hard to strike the right balance between what founders want to hear and what the investors find most useful in evaluating startups. We’ve got some exciting new stuff coming that people can look forward to hearing in upcoming episodes.It’s tough, for sure. Investors are very, VERY busy people. And to them, a podcast appearance is optional. Whereas working with their own deal flow is required. So it requires a lot of persistence and plenty of rejections as well. We were honored to have Dave McClure as a part of our pilot episode.There are a couple of reasons investors want to be on the panel:Those listening in obviously don’t get the brand benefit, but do get the deal flow. We’ve talked to a lot of investors who are excited about that.Yes, real investments will happen between founders and guest investors/panel members. It’s likely that the details will be worked out after a podcast airs, but a portion of each show is dedicated to following up with prior startups to hear about what happened after coming on the podcast.That the most interesting pitches are not always the most investable. Shark Tank, like any reality TV show, will bring on participants that are entertaining but not a serious contender. Just like how the show American Idol often showcases some of the worst singers because it evokes a response from viewers. We’ve decided not to go that route for The Pitch. While we want entertaining pitches on the show, we aren’t going to sacrifice the quality of startups we bring on the show just for entertainment value. Our goal is to bring on startups that strike just the right balance of entertainment and investability.We are hoping for a wider audience, but our goal is to cater to investors and founders first. It’s important to us that this show be as real a representation of what happens between founders and investors as possible. It’s a fact that two-thirds of the “deals” that happen on Shark Tank will never actually result in a real partnership. We want real investments to happen as a result of founders pitching on our show. Whether that happens between the investors we have on the show or the investors who tune into our show doesn’t matter to us. We just want deals to happen!We have some interesting ideas on how we could monetize the show, including sponsorships from the right companies that fit our listeners. What we find most interesting about the future of the show, is what happens when the JOBS act fully goes into effect in 2016. We feel that AngelList in particular is poised to be at the center of this change, but as a show we’d like to help the countless new investors who will become accredited under the new legislation.

For those of you who aren’t familiar, in the U.S. up until now, startup investing has been by law limited to those who either 1) have a net worth of over $1m excluding their home, or 2) earned an income over $200k each of the past 2 years. The JOBS act (signed in 2012 but not fully in effect yet) allows equity crowdfunding, and will theoretically allow anyone (no need to be accredited) to invest a small amount of money in startups.

It was about a month after graduating from Techstars that my co-founder, Lianne, and I had our “oh shit” moment.This is a special moment for founders; it’s not when you find a fixable bug in your app, when you realize you have been poorly optimizing your conversion funnel, or when you get a “no” from an investor. An “oh shit” moment is when you realize there is something In our case, we realized that the product that we wanted to create was irreconcilable with a viable business model. So who were we going to tell? Techstars, who just accepted us into their highly prestigious accelerator on the basis that we could make it work? Our investors, who we just closed a round with?It turns out, our Techstars family, our friends, and the angels (literally) who invested in us became our greatest allies, supporters, and advocates as we navigated the treacherous, terrifying, uncertain, and ultimately wildly liberating waters of a pivot. So let’s start at the beginning…In February of 2014, Lianne and I were completing our undergrad CS degrees at the University of Colorado. As we were reflecting on the past four years of school, we realized that the most valuable experiences that we had happened outside the classroom in the incredible communities that we became involved in. Being techies, we wanted to build a product which helped other students make these “serendipitous” connections around their campus — to make the most of their time in college as well. We wanted to help our friends explore their world around them.We called it Varsity. The app was basically a replacement for the unreadable kiosks full of posters found on college campuses. Students could submit events and activities happening around their campus that others could discover and indicate they were attending. We also built in a personalization mechanism, which proactively suggested things to do around you based upon your interests.A few months later, the MVP of the Varsity and a well-practiced pitch won us the The next couple of months were a whirlwind of change; Lianne and I graduated, we transitioned to our first full-time job (working for ourselves), and I spent a month in Israel with my sister before she left for college in Florida. We spent a good amount of our time networking our way around Techstars — feeling a little like the high school kids at a college party — but loving it at the same time. We met some incredible people (Sue Heilbronner, Brad Berenthal, Zach Nies, and Howard Diamond, to name a few) who taught us so much about our nascent business in a very short time.We took as many meetings as we could with whomever would talk with us, and we funneled all of our learnings into our Techstars application. Through some combination of luck, sweat, and my uncanny ability to say the right things when standing in front of a large group of people, we were accepted into Techstars.Techstars was incredibly challenging for us. The 3-month program was also equally rewarding. Lianne and I learned more about ourselves, our company, and our relationship with each other than we had in 4 years of undergraduate education together. About half-way through the program we started exploring new ways to monitize the platform. The product had come along way — we had done some incredible engineering and design work that we were happy with.Unfortunately, the problem with Varsity was absolutely zero alignment between the product that we wanted to build and the way that would bring it to market. One option was to spend the next 3 years grinding through the 8-month sales-cycles of universities across the country, which felt challenging (in the wrong ways) and bureaucratic. Alternatively, we could monetize the student attention we garnered, which we feared would cause discordance between the content students wanted to see and the content that advertisers wanted to show them.Soon after graduating from Techstars, someone showed us Simon Sinek’s So, we decided to pivot.Around this time I grabbed coffee with my friend Fletcher Richman. I explained to him the situation and asked for his advice. He offered the perspective that startups are designed to solve problems in the most efficient way possible. Basically, startups should be created to fill voids in the market that weren’t being solved by an existing company. The main issue was we had no problem to solve.Shit.250k in funding, but nothing to fund? Do we give up, give the money back, and go get real jobs? Lianne and I weren’t done yet, so we went in search of problems worth solving.Being borne out of both startup orthodoxy and an engineering education, we wanted to run several experiments, but we also felt it important that we took these experiments through to working So we made a commitment to build three apps in three weeks (how we did this is a story for another post). One of them was awful, one didn’t even make it out the door, but one of our experiments was really interesting. We called it Concierge.The idea was pretty simple; it was basically an aspirational to-do list connected to a chat conversation. Users would add things that they wanted to do in the next couple months (take a yoga class, go on a date with my girlfriend, etc). The cool part was this list was also visible to a team of local experts, who would do the research for you about how to get that thing done, and then chat with you in-app about doing it.The app took a week to get live, and we somehow convinced our intrepid team of interns to be our “in house” team of local experts. We emailed our friends links to the app, and within a couple weeks thousands of messages had been exchanged between our concierges and new users.The experiment was especially exciting because the job of the concierge was fun and rewarding. Our interns loved feeling helpful and resourceful, even though all they needed to do was a little Googling and creative research. Concierge was also innovative because we were successfully helping our users explore the world around them without a huge database of local content (a significant barrier to the old app being successful).One morning Lianne and I locked ourselves in a conference room for half the day and attempted to whiteboard out all of the learnings and opportunities we had over the past eight months. Our biggest insight was a total curveball to us: the times that we had felt we had discovered and explored the most (our “why”) was when we were traveling (we are both veteran backpackers and have been all around the world). We left that meeting knowing that if we woke up in 10 years and more people had gotten on an airplane as a result of our work, we would be satisfied. But we were still concerned that building a social network wouldn’t leave us feeling fulfilled. So why were we trying to build the next “social local mobile” thing, when we could be building something for fellow travelers?Around the same time we reconnected with an incredible entrepreneur and friend of ours, Sam Felsenthal. There was a kinship, because he was struggling with a similar pain to ours in his current venture — a long sales cycle in a difficult market.Sam had known about our Concierge experiment and knew that we were playing around with some things in travel. At about 4am one morning, I receive an email from him suggesting that we try a similar conversational app in travel. We tossed the idea around a bit more over the next couple of days, and started dreaming of something like the future of a travel agency in an app.“What the hell?” we thought. “Let’s make an experiment out of it.” I started putting together quick mockups of the idea, Lianne built a splash page to show off the mockups with an email drop, and Sam started shopping the idea around his network of travel and VC friends.We also started talking to anyone who would talk to us about the way they traveled. We spoke to about forty people in total, from people who travelled once a year to people who travelled every week for work. Consistently, we heard pain point after pain point around the time that travel logistics required. Pre-trip planning and booking was boring and time consuming, and mid-trip logistics and emergency management was harrowing and took time away from enjoying one’s travel.After several weeks it started to become clear that we were on to something. Over 300 people had signed up to try the app, and Sam was spending 80% (or more) of his time working on the company. Around this time we decided to take the plunge, and rebrand the concierge service form “experiment” to “pivot.” We also welcomed Sam on as a third co-founder, which will go down in history as Lianne’s and my greatest business move of all time.One Friday afternoon, while running through our database I noticed that we had received over 100 sign ups in the last hour. I quickly switched over to Mixpanel to figure out what was going on, and discovered that the referrer on all these signups was from a site called Turns out that Chris Messina (father of the hashtag) had found our splash page and posted us on the site. Within the afternoon we had been voted the top 3rd product. By the end of the weekend, Chris’s post drove over 10k people to our site.My inbox on Monday morning was a mess. I had messages from hundreds of people wondering how the service worked, how soon they could try it out, and how soon we would have an Android version released. We were ecstatic. The limelight (albeit, quite small in the grand scheme of things) was incredible validation for us during a murky and scary part of our history.When we went back to our early investors with the story of the pivot and some early traction, they were excited. (I think for many of them the pivot was a sigh of relief that they might actually see a return on their investment into these two crazy kids.)Today, we are incredibly motivated to be a part of what we see as a revolution in the traveler customer experience. We think it is insane that you have to wait on hold with Delta for 3 hours every time it snows in Boston. Why is it possible to arrive at a hotel with a reservation and no rooms be available? How do you quickly learn everything to know about city that you have never been before?Today, we are called Pana, your on-demand travel concierge. We are proud to build a way to give our users a way to make travel feel easy, personal, and safe. We are even prouder to have gotten here from where we have come.If you made it this far, you pretty much understand our company history as much as I do (perhaps even a little better).

In the last three weeks, I’ve given three talks to groups of entrepreneurs in Pittsburgh, Miami and New York City. It’s really great to get out and meet entrepreneurs at the beginning of their journey and offer (hopefully) helpful advice. I found myself repeating the following advice The two most important questions to ask as you’re starting a startup are:The phrasing of the first question is really important. I don’t want to know your revenue projections The phrase is ‘what will the world look like.’ Great entrepreneurs create the world the way it ought to be. Typically, an entrepreneur’s passion shines through when they answer this question. What broken thing in the world are you fixing? How will your product deliver value to your customers and, ultimately, their organization? If you’re struggling with this question, reflect on the motivation driving you and make sure you have The Lean Startup movement has done a great job of motivating people to get out of the building and talk to customers. For example, it’s made customer feedback techniques such as landing page or wizard of oz experiments almost the default approach to prioritizing the features on a product roadmap. However, your experiments should be prioritized by how valuable it is to get real world data about the hypothesis being tested and how inexpensively you can get it.One important thing with a queue is how you sort it. In this case, I recommend a sorting function that combines the above inputs (risk  ease of testing). Too many entrepreneurs I meet focus on lower risk hypotheses that are easy to test instead of figuring out how to test the mission-critical ones.For example, the biggest risk is usually “Does anyone want to buy your product?” Too often, the startup focuses instead on “Can we build the solution?” I always encourage tackling the highest risk hypothesis with the lowest investment of effort. For example, can you sketch out a paper prototype and see if you can get a letter of intent from a prospective customer? Rarely do you get better-validated learning than a few paying customers.When you sort your queue by risk and ease of testing, you start to think through how many things you can easily validate or invalidate up front before you run out of runway, which helps you think through how it impacts your financing strategy. Specifically, do you validate enough things about your business before running out of money to materially change your startup’s current valuation?My sense is that most entrepreneurs have some ideas around both of these questions but have spent too little time fleshing out their analysis. Remember — time is the most valuable (and constrained) resource that any of us have. Make sure you’re using yours to work on the big problem (question 1) in an efficient and effective way (question 2).As you start up your next venture, I encourage you make a big pot of coffee, turn off all of your devices, and spend a few hours in a room with a whiteboard to capture your thinking around these questions. Based on my experience, you’ll appreciate the clarity it brings.I’m a serial entrepreneur turned venture capitalist and professor.

“What details should we use for the final closing documents” is something that every entrepreneur wants to hear. I’d been working on a new idea for over 6 months, had a great team lined up and was on the eve of closing a $1.5M seed round with some of the best investors in the world including Brad Feld (Obviously this decision and email are pretty hard to write. But, it was the right thing to do and the right time to do it. But, how did I get there, what could I have done to prevent this outcome and what do I plan to do differently as I look for an idea worth funding?As a collegiate athlete (I went to Purdue on a swimming scholarship) and then a professional sailor doing long, offshore events, I’ve always dreamed about systems that could collect data about me, learn and suggest ways to optimize my performance. Then my mother was diagnosed with colon cancer, my father had a stroke and my brother and I struggled to help them understand their conditions, coordinate their care and look for the best solutions (specialists, clinical trials…). This was frustrating, time-consuming and not very “smart” and it seemed like a software solution could really help in both cases, a “platform for personalized health”. Ideas percolated for several years, while I built and sold My first steps were a blend of customer development and Starting a company requires some blend of imperfect data, reasonable assumptions and a collection of smart people who think the problem can be solved, but is ultimately some leap of faith. With a bunch of customer input, tons of research and a MVP, I decided to quit my day job and go for it. I went back to Brad, further articulated my plans, solutions to some of the issues we found, built a rough model with users, growth, team, revenue…and decided I needed 1.5M to get going at the pace I think the idea deserved. Brad was thoughtful in his questions and we agreed to fund the new company. I was on cloud nine and it was hard to contain my excitement!I’m a big believer in creating a “big tent” of smart people who can help an idea succeed and while Brad was happy to take the whole 1.5M, I wanted room for angels who could help the company grow and/or add unique value. We agreed to carve out 250K, for up to 10 angels (@25K each) in the round. I articulated that I wanted 2–3 people in 4 categories;For each category, I made a list of my top prospects. With Brad’s support as a foundation, I leveraged my network, found connections and followed much of the advice I’ve given before in While I was raising the money, we were also working on enhancing the prototype, diving deep into policies and regulations, talking to medical providers and continuing our customer research. As my enthusiasm for working with the team and the investors was increasing, we starting finding serious structural issues in the overall business, mostly outlined in my note to investors. We looked hard at incentives (who wanted us to succeed and who might want us to fail) and I will do this much more deeply in the future. We considered many, many options on ways to incentivize the consumer more and solve the structural issues that seemed entrenched on the provider side (very hard to do). I was optimistic that we could find good solutions but as the days marched forward toward the financing timeline I had communicated, the negatives mounted and my confidence decreased.During every startup, you reach points of critical inflection; when to narrow to a specific focus (vs. idle chit-chat about ideas), when to start coding an MVP, when to commit full-time and quit your day job, when to raise money, hire your first employees… Obviously there are many more points in the future, but these early points are some of the most critical. As an entrepreneur, each of these points presents an opportunity to take stock, weigh the risks/rewards, make a plan and then re-commit to the next major milestone/inflection point. Knowing Foundry and the investors I’d lined up and the team I’d recruited, I knew that we were all committing to at least 3–10 years of our lives to work on this idea. I wrestled with the idea, brainstormed with the team, talked with other CEO’s I respected and discussed with my wife who has seen me succeed and fail in the past. The process of discussion and communicating my decision-making criteria helped it crystallize my opinions and in the end, the calculus was not right.I was in Boulder for a I remain sad, frustrated by the systems and incentives at play in healthcare. As for healthcare innovation, I do plan to keep working toward an idea worth funding.

A little over a year ago I joined a startup for the very first time. I’ve been freelancing for over 6 years. I also have some working-at-an-agency-experience.After a year of working at a startup I think I would always want to work on something for a longer period and keep improving for many reasons. I’ll try to explain some of my main reasons.Everyone at a startup is by far more motivated to build something great. Your colleagues could probably be working anywhere, yet they chose to work where they are right now. Try to imagine what this means for the culture of the company. Really.We’re all shedding blood, sweat, and tears, because we all want this to succeed. That way, we’ll have something we can be very proud of in a couple of years.I undervalued working with colleagues. My current colleagues are super smart, all masters in their fields of expertise. And we share a lot of common interests.Last year I learned more from my colleagues than I did from my clients in the past 6(!) years. We’re constantly helping each other to become better.I think Sure, being a freelancer comes with a lot of benefits, but I actually kept most of the benefits working at a startup. They don’t care when or where you work, as long as you deliver.Some of my colleagues go and ride their bikes for a couple of hours in the middle of the day or leave the office because it’s great kitesurfing weather. And yes, sometimes we pull an all nighter, but all on our own initiative.That being said, the freedom you have as a freelancer is somewhat of an illusion. You have to make sure money comes in, so, as Fabio mentioned very well, it can be very tempting to take on too many projects at once. The feeling of getting paid is great so you’re often convincing yourself that it will be an amazing project, but to be honest: often it’s not.You have a lot of influence on the product. When working at an agency or doing freelance this is way harder. Especially when working at an agency where the client is afraid to do something different (and maybe a little risky).Not being tied down to hours and ownership gives you the ability to fix small things right away.It’s easy to look at a startup as what it is today. It’s even more interesting if you try to fantasize about what they could become.Let’s take Uber for example: why is Uber worth more than $50 billion?If they are going to move goods, I don’t know what’s gonna stop them from selling goods.Our secret plans are making me very excited! The impact that I think we — at After my first year, I couldn’t agree more.

The hardest thing about entrepreneurship is So, how do you stay psychologically strong? Surprisingly, I’ve found that more than anything else, a morning routine keeps me happy and productive.This routine makes sure I get a minimum dose of exercise, meditation, and nutrition. Planning my day then provides the direction to channel my energy.I’ve tried a bunch of different techniques and routines. At the end, this is the minimal set of things that works for me. It works partly because…This routine seems almost What’s more, it’s pretty enjoyable. It’s something I look forward to, each morning when I wake up. Eating, meditating, and exercising all help boost dopamine levels in the brain, increasing your level of motivation for the rest of day.Got a routine of your own? Email Founder 

Established markets and new markets are not the same so the way that you market and sell to them is different. For startups, it’s really important to know the difference. For each type of market are using different marketing tactics, executed in different ways with different expected results.In an established market, there are prospects out there that understand that they have a problem that needs to be solved. There will also be prospects actively in the process of learning about, shopping for and purchasing solutions.In new markets, prospects are blissfully unaware that they even have a problem. They aren’t researching solutions or shopping for solutions to a problem that they don’t know they have.If we think about a typical buyer journey we can see that in new markets, the bulk of buyers are starting at a different starting point than the buyers in a more established markets.So how are the marketing tactics different for these different markets? For new markets the first job of marketing is to educate your target segment that there is a problem to be solved in the first place. This is counterintuitive for many startup who would rather jump in and talk about why their solution is better than other solutions. Until prospects believe they have a problem to solve, efforts to market solutions will be really ineffective. Why should I care about your solution? I don’t even have that problem!When there is no demand for your solution, tactics that we typically use to capture existing demand are ineffective. People aren’t searching for solutions so using advertising or SEO to drive people to sign up will have limited success — there simply aren’t enough people ready to buy.Marketers in new markets have to start by educating the market that there is problem. Many of the tactics you might use here look like tactics you would use later in the buying process but the content used to support them and the “Ask” are different.For example, let’s say you have a marketing solution for Snapchat. You might decide to create a blog and write a series of blog posts to try to engage with a community of marketers that are likely to use Snapchat as a marketing channel. After talking to marketers however, you learn that most of them aren’t using Snapchat today, nor do they see that as a viable place to do marketing. Your marketing might include blog posts, ebooks, infographics, video, etc. and the content in there will be around demonstrating that marketers are missing the boat on this new platform. You could do this with case studies of how other folks have used it, data that demonstrates the potential of the platform as a channel, examples of content that is already being shared there, etc. You might want to run a snapchat campaign yourself (not to capture marketers who have already demonstrated their cluelessness about the platform) but to gather your own data about how a campaign might potentially work.If we take the same example but go with the insight that the target segment is already interested in using Snapchat as a marketing channel and might be actively looking for ways to make that easier, you can imagine that some of the tactics would be the same (blog posts, infographics, video) but the content in them would be different. In this case you wouldn’t have to convince your audience that Snapchat is cool, you would have to convince them that your solution is better than whatever they are using today. The content of your marketing content is different because the context is different. In this case there would also be other tactics you could add — paid advertising, email marketing, events, webinars, creating a buyers guide, outbound telemarketing — that are designed to capture folks that are further down the buying process and are already shopping for a solution.If I am marketing into an existing market and there are folks that are already searching for solutions then it makes sense that I can just get out there and sell to those prospects. On the other hand, if my prospects don’t realize they have a problem worth solving yet, I first have to help them understand the cost of not solving the problem before I can try to convince them that my solution is the best out there and they should buy it. The “Ask” (what I am asking my prospects to do) when they click on my link or hit my landing page can’t be “Sign up for a trial” or “Buy now” for folks in these earlier stages. In new markets, frequently the “Ask” is “please allow me to keep talking to you”. That might mean subscribing to a blog or a newsletter or following my updates on social media. Once I have your permission to do that, then later when you are ready to buy, I can ask for permission sell you something.The other thing to keep in mind is that prospects that don’t know they need your stuff yet aren’t really all that interested in investing the time to learn anything quite yet. If your content can be funny or inspiring or just generally interesting, you have a better chance of getting permission to keep talking to them.Here’s a chart I have used in workshops to illustrate the differences between tactics that are used at different stages.I do startup marketing and sales.

Remember back in 2013, when reading files on “mobile” was new and everyone was wondering how the h*ck to do it? That’s when Martin Destagnol, entrepreneur and engineer, built Folders. And Destagnol is now Director of Mobile and of Box Notes — the French “serial” “startuper” went from building a product in his apartment (we don’t get many garages in Paris) to managing a whole engineering team inside one of the fastest-growing startups in the Silicon Valley. How does one do that? Here’s the story.As you might hear often times when wondering why an entrepreneur built a startup, Folders came from Martin’s own frustration: accessing cloud-stored files on mobile was just a pain. So he decided to build an iOS client providing the very best User Experience possible.But Destagnol also brought a strong business rationale to the idea: as Folders was his 3rd startup, he knew what kind of risk he was willing to take and what outcome to expect. His previous company, Plyce, was a social network based on coupons, which had a great potential but also high risks. When coming up with Folders, his ambition was to build a product much more targeted, with higher chances of a “smaller scale” success. The bet was that one of the existing cloud providers could need a product like Folders; worst case scenario, he would still sell enough to make up for the money invested.Then he shut down everything else but work, and built Folder in 7 months. Full time. Like, 24/7. As in Once the app was approved by the Apple store, Destagnol decided to come to San Francisco to show it to Box, Dropbox and Google Drive. The product wasn’t launched, but he figured the sooner he would show it to the big players to get their feedback, the better — for those of you who are reading from elsewhere than San Francisco, yes, that’s what happens here, you can just meet people like that. Hence Destagnol coming; although to be fair, he had some introductions.Right after his first meetings with the platform and mobile teams at Box, they asked him if he could stay a little longer to show it to some additional people. They all clicked instantly, and at that point, Destagnol had figured out this meeting was actually going somewhere.During the same day, Martin met with 13 different people including Aaron Levie, Box’s CEO, Sam Schillace, SVP of Engineering and Sam Ghods, CTO, who were freaking out over how great the features and UX of Folders were. When Box offered to acquire Folders, Martin knew instantly that it would actually happen: that’s “entrepreneur’s intuition”.Today, Folders’ first features seem pretty obvious: fast picture loading, folder offline saving, snappy interface. But at the time, other products simply did not have them; in bigger companies, the back-and-forth movement between the product team and the engineering team takes a lot of time and energy. Product people make requests to the Tech team, the Tech team knows what’s possible or not, but does not necessarily have the overall vision. Destagnol had all the skills and was super detail-oriented; that’s how he managed to build the best UX, faster than them.When Destagnol joined Box, he started as a manager, and got Destagnol was basically coming to re-build everything using his ideas, which was potentially frustrating for the existing team. So Destagnol pushed the team to restart from a blank page together. They looked at each features and decided to take the best from both sides. That way, they all felt like they were part of a common project, and every engineer felt as if they were the owner of the decisions being made.After a successful launch of the iOS app, Box asked Destagnol to do the same thing with Android as well. So when the annual review period arrived, Destagnol was pretty sure he would get promoted. After all, he had de-facto doubled the size of his team and had 2 successful launches. But he didn’t. And he was extremely disappointed about it.When he discussed his non-promotion with Sam Schillace, SVP of Engineering at Box and former creator of Google Docs, Sam told him: ““When you’re initially a hands-on manager, like Destagnol, it’s actually a huge challenge to learn to scale and delegate. What works when you are a small team doesn’t work anymore as you grow. He learned that it was not O.K to break an existing dynamics in a team, just to get results. Nor was it O.K to decide things by himself without bringing the team along with him. He had achieved outstanding results, but this had also led the product manager and designer to leave the company; so, even though the app launches went really well, there For the next 6 months, after his reality check, Destagnol relied much more on his team to make decisions and was there only as a last resort. As a result, the team stepped up and felt more involved, and Destagnol got a lot more time to take on new initiatives. Destagnol started working with the Box Notes group and was promoted twice in a year. He now leads the iOS, Android, Windows and Box Notes teams, which represent more than 30 engineers and managers.In a highly competitive atmosphere like the Valley, where every company is struggling to hire qualified people, it’s critical that Destagnol maintains a happy and productive team. For that, he makes sure to define a sense of purpose for each individual, which is a combination of many different things: how you believe in your company’s vision, how your own team contributes to it, what do you personally bring to it, how what you do is aligned with your career goals, how you get along with your teammates, etc.All of these dimensions matter and every retention issue is related in a way or another to this sense of purpose. Destagnol and his managers make sure they talk openly and candidly with each teammate every week, so that can quickly identify issues and elaborate improvement plans with them.“Being a manager “at scale”, for Destagnol, means witnessing people growing around you. A manager’s own performance doesn’t matter, it’s his/her team’s that’s important. In a nutshell, Destagnol realized that a good manager makes himself optional.Thanks Martin for this inspiring conversation. I hope this has encouraged you, other readers, to build your own.

I’ve always said that I’m great at execution, but not so much an “idea person,” wishing I was more creative. So naturally, when I finally had an idea, I immediately got to work executing it.Ideas usually come from either a place of frustration (solving a pain point) or passion (doing what you love). This one came from both.Friends and acquaintances are always asking me where I find new music. Each time, I give them a wordy explanation and send them apps and newsletters, and have even written It’s not that this bothers me. I LOVE talking music any time, any day, with anyone. But clearly there is something missing. These people are busy. They’re entrepreneurs, startup folks, attorneys. They have families, hobbies, and well, lives that don’t revolve around listening to music and going to shows. They already have plenty of apps and tools for their everyday jobs and they don’t need more. That doesn’t mean music isn’t important to them, it’s just that they don’t have time to hunt for it.I thought A Song A Day was something that some of my close friends would enjoy — a project that would require me to wake up an hour earlier to send some emails. It turns out far more people were into it than I thought.I went for a run around 7:30pm Monday night, and for whatever reason was thinking about this issue (as I was either jamming out to By 9pm, I was working on a far-from-perfect website. By 12:30am Tuesday, it was complete (enough) with domain purchased. I sent the link to a few friends and went to sleep, sort of. My friends liked it, so I went ahead and threw a tweet out there at 8:53am.A couple of minutes later, several people had RT’d it, including By the end of Tuesday, we had Since being featured on Product Hunt, I have been overwhelmed with the kindest, most encouraging emails and tweets I’ve ever received. I’ve had to choke back tears of joy several times reading these emails when in public.I’ve had people beyond my friends offer to help develop a product; I’ve received amazing and super smart feedback; had several people ask to be curators (30 curator sign ups + people who have emailed, tweeted, called me, etc.). People have been thanking me; telling me how impressed they are; telling me that my story has inspired them to get serious about their side project; and the list goes on….Someone even sent me a logo they designed for the project!Then I received the ultimate encouragement (other than my brother telling me he was so f@*ing proud, of course)…These people are makers themselves — creatives, developers, designers, entrepreneurs, journalists. They’re passionate people who love music as much as I do. They’re people who have inspired me online and off. Considering I have a fairly demanding day job (that I love) and have been sleeping very little this week, this encouragement has kept me going.This is probably a good time to share the mission of A Song A Day:Rightfully so. In hindsight, I probably should have started the waitlist MUCH sooner than I did. Of the 606 people who have signed up to date (as of 6pm on Saturday), I have been working my very best to send 358 of them a song a day. I’ve been doing this manually, as I wasn’t kidding about the human algorithm thing on the site.Daily song delivery hasn’t exactly happened, but I’ve come close to a song a day to everyone, and I think most people understand I am doing my best.Here’s my current process:I look at everyone’s preferences and listen to bands that they love, but I’ve never heard of. Next, I batch people together based on these preferences and choose songs that span the spectrum, to the best of my ability. I then craft a personalized email for those interests and send via a Gmail mail merge. Although, I am switching to Intercom. Here’s one of the first emails I sent (I included a link to a survey in the first couple of rounds of emails. This was a great idea in theory, but extremely time consuming and difficult to cross-reference hundreds of individual survey responses and a spreadsheet of 358 people. For now, I’ve highlighted the people who didn’t like their songs, so if nothing else, I know that I have to look for something different for them. This process needs to be more seamless.This system has holes. A lot of them. I’ve revamped the submission form since first launching and am working on a few solutions to make aSongaDay.co more sustainable and scaleable, without losing the human touch.We’ve already come across some minor issues building v1.5. I know that the site has a stupid hamburger menu that doesn’t make any sense, and that when you share the site it says “Intro.” These are all things I’m working on fixing now. It goes against my natural instinct to ship and work out kinks so publicly, but it’s kind of a rush. I’m definitely enjoying the experience.As soon as I hit “publish” on the site Monday night, I realized that this thing could and should be Not to mention, listening to someone else’s music and finding songs you think they’ll like is So I am building a Right now, a friend is building a basic MVP (minimal viable product) allowing me to partially automate at least the song hunt process and email distribution. Not to worry, a human (not a robot) — me and a couple of close friends for now — will still be making the final decisions on which songs get sent to who based on all of the preferences members have filled out.I’m already thinking about what v2 will look like and all of the features I want to see in the final product. But first, and far more importantly, I need to I’m sending out two surveys today — one to those on the waitlist and another to those who are already receiving emails — asking them why they signed up. I’m assuming the appeal is the human aspect, as there are other similar products out there. But I could be wrong. I need to figure this out before moving too far along. I look forward to writing about my findings.I’ve had a lot of people tell me that they like the project and the idea, and that has been beyond validating and encouraging, but I still wonder if I am completely crazy.

By boris, September 08, 2015When you’re in the midst of building a company, it’s hard to fully assess the significance of various activities and decisions- particularly for first-time entrepreneurs who don’t yet have the wisdom learned from prior mistakes.As an investor (who was also once a first-time entrepreneur), I have noticed several key areas where founders either overestimate or underestimate the value to their company. Here they are…5 things founders often underestimateYour company won’t survive if you’ve got a great idea surrounded by a mediocre team. Founders should stay involved in every hiring decision for as long as possible. When you’ve reached the scale when it’s no longer possible to be hands-on in each decision, you need to make sure you have strong hiring methodologies in place — such as I’m always surprised at how often people still get hired without extensive reference checks. When you’ve got a good feeling about someone, it’s tempting to just move ahead without any kind of due diligence. But informal reference checks can be very revealing, particularly if you can talk to people that weren’t provided by the candidate, but know him or her very well.Founders often mistake culture with things like morning yoga, a company climbing wall or food truck lunches. But culture is deeper than just free perks and it’s also something you can’t just “switch on” down the road when you have time for it. From the start, you should be thinking about the type of company you want to build and then make sure your systems and decisions support that vision.This point might seem self-serving, but too often I’ve seen founders look at investors as checkbooks. Money is important but over and over again I’ve also seen just how important great investors and advisors can be in shaping an early stage company.Your company and your product will never be all things to all people. And not every customer opportunity will be worth pursuing in the long run. You need to narrow your focus to a few key priorities, and then make sure this focus is communicated clearly and repeatedly throughout the company.4 things founders overestimateNo amount of money in the world is going to get you to product-market fit. And raising too much money before you find product-market fit will usually kill your start-up.Start-up founders typically want to make a big PR splash when they’re launching their product or closing a funding round. A major launch announcement can make a lot of noise in moment, but it’s more important to focus on generating continuous demand than your 15 minutes of fame. Likewise, fundraising announcements can drive investor interest for future financing rounds, but I’ve found it’s usually better to just stay under the radar and build the company.Young startups often feel compelled to bring on senior employees with impressive resumes and a deep knowledge of their vertical. While specific expertise can help in some cases, you should hire for smarts, passion and hard work, rather than experience.It would be great to find that silver bullet to take your business to the next level. The problem is that you rarely ever find them. When founders waste their time chasing after that one non-existent thing that will solve all their problems, they ignore all the small incremental improvements that will make a real difference.-Entrepreneur turned investor.

The If you’re a BC-based startup, you’ve likely bought this pitch: you’re registering your corporation for investor tax credits, applying for government grants, and being told to count on the government refunding a generous portion of your technical salaries.What you haven’t been told is that these incentives can hurt your startup, even as they benefit investors and larger technology businesses that can absorb the cost of participation. These programs sabotage otherwise-nimble young companies by introducing crippling bureaucracy, hundreds of hours of busywork for founders, and tens of thousands of dollars of new costs.Participation is effectively mandatory, since early-stage startups that eschew these programs will struggle to compete for local investment and employees. Founders who decide to play ball, however, will find that their startups receive no net benefit from participation, as the programs’ subsidies have already been fully priced in to the ecosystem.There are three programs that are especially onerous for founders. These are the initialisms that can be found on the last slide of a typical BC startup’s Friends and Family or Seed pitch deck:The EBC program provides a A dedicated founder might purchase shares in their own startup’s fundraising round. This investment is a positive, healthy signal, and should be encouraged.But EBC investment credits are only available to investors that That means if two co-founders create their corporation with each owning 50% of the voting shares, they will not be eligible for the same EBC investment credit that their external investors receive. The founders, when buying shares in their own company, effectively EBC startups must file a yearly report with the BC Ministry of Finance. From a If an EBC startup raises $500K or more, even across multiple small rounds or multiple years, a typical Notice to Reader year-end engagement is insufficient. The startup must instead hire an accounting firm to perform a Review Engagement. Below is a comparison of a bill for a Notice to Reader (pre-EBC) and a Review Engagement (post-EBC), for the same startup, from a reputable accounting firm.Receiving EBC status requires founders to complete a manual certification process with the BC Ministry of Finance. Once certified, startups must then request an allocation (“Equity Authorization”) from the EBC program’s annual budget.There is no guarantee that the EBC’s budget will be sufficient for all applicants, and allocations are provided from the program’s limited budget on a If a startup has unlucky timing with its round and does not receive an allocation, The National Research Council’s Industrial Research Assistance Program awards non-dilutive grants for the research, development, and commercialization of technology by Canadian small businesses.NRC-IRAP contracts require lengthy project proposals, ongoing documentation, and regular meetings during and after the project’s completion.Contribution amounts can be A startup should only seek an NRC-IRAP contract if it intends to develop and commercialize the contracted project’s work for five full years after the project’s completion, or it risks being ordered to repay NRC-IRAP’s contribution.To guarantee the NRC-IRAP has theContracts are only awarded to firms that can prove their ability to develop and market the project without NRC-IRAP’s contribution. Projects that are deemed reliant on NRC-IRAP’s support will not be accepted. If, during a project’s development, NRC-IRAP decides that a startup no longer has the ability to complete the project or commercialize its fruits, it may find the startup in breach, cancel the contract, and demand repayment of any contributions made so far.NRC-IRAP contribution agreements specify that a “negotiated exit” from the startup’s long-term commitments is possible, via an undocumented process for pleading for a reduction in the firm’s repayment obligation. This is entirely at NRC-IRAP’s discretion, and NRC-IRAP reserves the right to place further restrictions on the startup as part of the exit conditions.NRC-IRAP attempts to award grants on a merit basis to qualified small businesses in capital-efficient technology industries.Federal government employees called Industrial Technology Advisors (ITAs) are responsible for evaluating grant proposals for feasibility, commercial potential, and the startup’s strength as a business. ITAs must consider grant applications based on factors that include “Because the The SRED program is a massive tax incentive administered by the Canada Revenue Agency (Canada’s IRS). It provides a tax credit for research and development done in Canada. For startups, this most often means that some portion of their engineering or computer science work can be claimed as a refundable credit at the end of a fiscal year.To claim SRED credits, a company must have hour-by-hour time accounting of all employees engaged in research and development. Employee time must be clearly demarcated between SRED and non-SRED work. The demarcations must be exactly supported by evidence: contemporaneous time sheets, project management logs, commits, and so on.Founders are required to collect, analyze, and submit all evidence related to the SRED-applicable work — screenshots, tickets, commit logs, milestones, Gantt charts, emails, chat logs, etc. — in order to justify their claim. The CRA will carefully scrutinize time tracking Whether salaried or paid hourly, a research-engaged employee’s every working hour must be provably attributable to one or more SRED projects to be eligible for credit.Every individual piece of supporting evidence must be pigeon-holed in to one or more of the 12 mandated Kafkaesque categories, like “Scientific or technological uncertainties” and “Test protocols, test data, analysis of test results, conclusions”.For a startup with a 5-person engineering team submitting its first claim, The volume of work involved in preparing an SRED claim, submitting it, and defending against a review might tempt founders to hire a consultant to assist with the claim.But the CRA punishes founders for hiring third parties to assist with claims. Engaging a third party for claim preparation is a red flag that increases the company’s odds of having its claim audited. The CRA detects this by obligating startups to disclose whether it received claim preparation assistance from a third party, as well as the third party’s billing arrangement and the exact amount paid for assistance.This recent policy change is ostensibly aimed at Larger companies can afford to stay under the radar by hiring an internal business analyst, project manager, or technical writer to prepare SRED claims as an employee; these options are not available to early-stage startups.The CRA hasThe review process is gruelling. The Then, the company must wait for a team from the CRA to schedule an in-person meeting at the company’s office. This can take months, depending on the personal schedules of the assigned CRA reviewers.During the review, the company must produce access to any evidence and employees that the CRA requests, or Startups with claims under review should expect a delay of at least six months from filing before receiving confirmation that they are eligible for their refund — an eon in startup terms, especially if the founders are occupied with government paperwork to move the process forward for the duration. Refunds routinely take an additional 2 months to be issued even once eligibility is confirmed.No matter how removed from true research a startup’s work is, its investors will still expect it to apply for refundable SRED credits. They may undercapitalize the company and expect SRED to pick up the slack. Or, the founders themselves may be guilty of relying on non-dilutive SRED refunds instead of seeking additional equity financing.Investors, because of their certainty that companies will receive SRED refunds, will ask a startup’s board to book SRED credits for each month’s research expenditures as receivables. This aggressive accounting is common even though the lag from expenditure to refund can be 18 months or more. It also doesn’t account for the fact that claims are frequently adjusted downwards (or denied altogether).Surprise claim processing delays that critically affect a startup’s cashflow are endemic to the point that an entire SRED refund financing industry (The CRA will, however, pay BC is a fine home for startups — but that’s despite government incentives, not because of them. It has enviable cities, liberal social policies, and the second-lowest corporate tax rates in Canada (much lower than California). It’s full of world-class developers and has a lively startup community. Choose BC for these reasons, not for the unavoidable incentive programs and their requisite mountain of bureaucracy.If the provincial and federal bodies responsible for these incentives want to offer startups effective tools instead of crippling burdens, a hard look is needed at the true cost that founders incur by participating.It shouldn’t take a founder months out of each year to manage these programs. Until that changes, these incentives only benefit investors and large businesses, and startups just get the paperwork.Decent guy. Co-founder of Sharing our ideas and experiences

I am a tech entrepreneur. My last business was After being Feel free to jump to the conclusion at the bottom if you would like. :)Let’s start with one of the easiest metrics to quantify. The cost of a developer in each of these cities. Taking a look at salary data on AngelList — we can see that average developer salary in San Francisco makes ~$120k USD.On top of the $120k — there are two additions that I would like to take into account. First, most companies in San Francisco have to offer a ridiculous amount of perks and benefits in order to compete. Three free meals a day, travel stipends, yoga/gym memberships, free flights home, games rooms, and a never ending supply of free drinks and snacks are just a few examples. Let’s call it (+$30k) for these perks and benefits. Secondly, given the number of opportunities available at big tech companies as well as other startups, the average tenure of a developer is somewhere between 1 to 1.5 years. I have associated a cost to this quick turnover (+$40k) which is very conservative.Now — let’s take a look at the average developer salary in Toronto. On AngelList, a majority are in the $59k USD segment. From experience and a few other data sources, let’s call is $65k CAD (equivalent to $50k USD)One of the great benefits of being in Canada is the government Of course, we need to also look at the quality of these devs. The truth is, many of the developers coming out of the University of Waterloo are some of the best in the world. While a portion of these great developers move out to the valley, there are many who prefer to stay in Toronto.For many startups, raising money will be an important step in the growth of their business. The Toronto VC community has improved dramatically over the past few years — with smart money being invested by BDC, OMERS, iNovia, Georgian Partners, Rho, Real Ventures, and many others. However, VC investments in Toronto pales compared to Silicon Valley. Regardless of which data source and which metrics (# of investments, average investment size, $ available at various stages) you look at, Silicon Valley wins by 20–30x! Think $1 billion invested by VC’s in Ontario There are many One question which I always think about is: There are The last time I was in Silicon Valley, I met ~20 friendly VC’s who I had interacted with during my time at AdParlor. I asked two very simple questions:The answer to my first question was primarily a ‘yes’. Of course, there is a big difference between saying yes and actually writing a cheque. :) Many VC’s were adamant on me solving a problem that I witnessed at AdParlor and/or staying in the marketing/advertising space.The answer to my second question was about 50/50. Some VC’s would have no problem investing in me if I were to be based in Toronto given that I have had an exit before. While the other half would want me to be based closer to them. Given this — I will use the lower end of the 20–30x scale. While being able to raise US money in Toronto is possible, nothing can beat being physically present in the valley to network and build relationships with the big US VC firms. Keep in mind that most rounds have multiple investors. VC’s bring in their VC ‘friends’ to invest with them. The US ecosystem is much bigger, hence each US VC has more ‘friends’ they could bring in, making it easier to raise a large round.There are MANY other factors to dissect, but in the interest of keeping this post readable — I am going to nail the next few out in a paragraph each.My thought process is still a work in progress. I am hoping this blog post will inspire a healthy debate. As of now, after thinking about all these factors for a long time, here is what I have concluded:Three important exceptions/notes:Myself and my co-founder are currently in the ideation phase, so I will take my own advice. We plan to work in a co-working space in San Francisco for the next 3 months. Not sure where we will be after that. Who knows what will happen. The uncertainty of the startup life…Entrepreneur. Previous: CEO @ AdParlor

When I was actually working at startups (including the one I founded), I remember feeling like there were too many variables, nothing was in my control, and like the shifting sands might swallow me up at any moment. These were the moments where I sought advice from advisors and investors.Sometimes their advice was really valuable and other times it was not. But, my level of agreement or disagreement with the advice didn’t define what was helpful and what fell flat. I found that the best advisors were not always right, but their guidance was always solid. When I was drowning, being offered something solid to push against was just as good as being thrown a lifeline to grab. As a founder, I would build on their thinking and discover the best path forward or push back and gain a new perspective as I took apart their logic piece by piece. For me, it was this process of collaboration and debate that brought out my best and was most valuable to me and my company. Because of this, I believe the most valuable advisors deliver clarity of thought and structured arguments that can be climbed step by step or taken apart piece by piece. (fwiw they also have the attitude and empathy to engage in this process without ego).I could never get a solid grip on advice summarized by, “I’ve seen this before + instinct = decision.” Unfortunately, that’s the format that most advisors and investors fall back to when asked for help. For example, at my fitness video game company we did not have the resources to build for both Xbox and Playstation and we needed to choose one or the other as our launch platform. In many ways, this was a bet-the-company moment and I started asking for guidance.Investor #1 said Xbox first. He had faced a “similar” platform choice in his own company and was certain we should focus on Xbox. I pushed him on why and he told me successful launches depend on platform support that comes from strong relationships with internal champions. He had worked with Microsoft before as a third-party software vendor and believed he could help us connect with the executives there and get them on our side. I was left to trust that he had “seen this before,” that his experience was similar to ours and that he actually could connect us with the right people at Microsoft.He did get me to the right people at Xbox in the end, but nothing he said helped me make the platform decision.Investor #2 argued for Playstation. He felt that we should optimize for getting to market vs. optimizing the level of success we would achieve once we got out there. He advised us not to underestimate the risk of not shipping at all — like unexpected delays in product development, changes in priorities at platform partners, lack of interest at the retail buyer level, etc. With an alternative title targeting an alternative audience, he argued that we should be optimizing for the highest probability of getting the game to retail shelves. He felt retailers would be more likely to take a risk on a Playstation title because of the relative scale of the Playstation install base (about 5x what Xbox had at the time I think).We ended up launching on Xbox first, but Investor #2 helped me the most in making the decision. The shift in focus from best opportunity once in market to best opportunity to get to market at all was critical.He really helped organize my thoughts around taking the product from its current state of test code to a shrink wrapped game on store shelves. For both PlayStation and Xbox, we identified dependencies at each stage in the process. We discussed the retail buyers, the distributor/channel partners, the platform marketing support, the process of publishing, QA/QC, internal deadlines, budgets and and submission timelines for publishing approval.This conversation with Investor #2 made it obvious that we had to go Xbox first — but not because it was a better platform with buyers who were more open to alternative titles or because we had stronger relationships at Microsoft. We had to go Xbox first because it was the only version of the game that could possibly be ready to launch for the holiday season (and generate the revenue we needed to survive and build a second title). We had built the play testing PC version in Visual C (because Xbox and PlayStation developer licenses were expensive) and the DirectX development environment was much closer to Visual C than the Playstation development environment. We had high confidence that our current team could port the game to Xbox from PC while the same move to Playstation had a lot of risk and would have required 2–3 more engineering hires (putting more pressure on us by increasing our burn rate).In my experience, you shouldn’t look for advisors who give you an answer on a silver plate (in this example the best advice started with the wrong answer but the process got us to the right conclusion). Instead, you have to push for well reasoned, well researched, strong opinions that stand up to your analysis. You have to demand that your advisors offer solid advice that you can latch on to and use to pull yourself up or push against to spring forward in the opposite direction. You need guidance from people who aren’t afraid to unpack their instincts so you can choose the best, recombine it, and leave the rest.Reimagining VC from the ground up to help founders win.

When I learned about the tragic story this week, my heart broke for her and her family — and then my heart shattered again when I thought about how many more successful people struggle with mental health issues and how these polarizing and cyclical feelings of both hypomania and depression can be exacerbated in the startup environment. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about someone in the startup world committing suicide and sadly, it won’t be the last.If fact, you might think you are one of them after a quick Google on hypomania, depression and cyclothemia.Many of the most successful leaders in history have suffered from some sort of mental health issues. Abraham Lincoln suffered from depression. Winston Churchill was thought to have had bipolar disorder. The list goes on and on…but remember, it’s all a spectrum, just like sexuality. Doctors try not to put a label on anyone. We all hate the buzzword “unicorn” in the startup world, but that’s what we all are. We’re all different.This is exactly why we need to start talking more about the ups and downs of entrepreneurship and how they mirror the ups and downs experienced by those who suffer from mental health issues. We need to ignore the stigma and figure out what we can do to help valuable startup team members without judgement.If startup leaders are not scared of failure, then why do we avoid talking about the bumps in the road? I was afraid to talk about this — to out myself and many of my friends, but I’m doing it anyway. We need to encourage people to get help, rather than self-medicating or ignoring the problem until they crash and something tragic happens.How many startups have a whole fridge for beer, available from morning until night — however late the night might go. How many startup employees have whiskey bottles at their desks? How many of these people are sleeping more than 3–4 hours a night? How many of these brilliant but restless people have to smoke a giant blunt just to calm down at the end of the day? How many of these people are abusing Adderall, developing drug addictions and having to buy the pills illegally when the dosage stops working and their doctors won’t prescribe more? How many of these people are chainsmoking — e-cigs or real cigs? Honestly, it doesn’t matter — we should all probably be breathing instead. The truth is self medication is the name of the game in this world and it only makes things worse.Sometimes I look around the city and think, we’re all like this. We’re all hypomanic. If we can make it here, we’ll make it anywhere but the truth is that we all get depressed and burnt out at some point. The constant noise of the city quiets our minds, giving us some kind of peace — maybe like a New Yorker’s version of meditation. Let’s be honest though: there’s not a lot of people who moved to New York City to relax. I sure didn’t.I am not saying that you should fire your developer because he’s moody sometimes. He probably doesn’t get enough sleep because he’s working all night long. I’m not saying your business development executive should be looked at any differently because after a few too many drinks at Happy Hour, she admitted that she took anxiety medication and really shouldn’t be drinking. Your developer is not going to fly off the handles and go crazy, and neither is she. In reality, she’s the one actually doing the right thing by beginning the process of taking care of herself so she doesn’t crash into depression and not make her goals. The developer might be experiencing hypomania. He just really needs a nap and probably can’t turn off because he can’t stop thinking about the workload. Give him a day off to rest and let him rest. Don’t call him every 5 minutes. He will be even more valuable to you when he gets back to work the next day, trust me.The taboo of mental illness has existed forever. However, in a community where unrelenting optimism is so important, founders and startup team members have to keep a poker face regardless of how they are feeling that day. Sometimes their depression has nothing to do with their workload. In the case of Faigy, she didn’t feel her Ultra-Orthodox Hasidic family accepted her. She had feelings of rejection from her parents and her community. Her depression probably came from a much deeper place than the startup life. Negative thoughts can creep up on you, even if everyone else around you thinks that your life is all sunshine and rainbows. No one knows everyone’s life story.Before reading the sad news, I ironically had spent the entire day working on a book proposal on this very subject and my own personal experiences with hypomania and depression. I immediately was inspired to write something to help our community understand. And like I said, I only know Today, I thought about Faigy and all the other people who suffer silently. After years of working with entrepreneurs at Launching the company and the instability of the seed capital stage made me feel anxious and on edge, but my enthusiasm covered it all up. I loved what I was doing but I didn’t tell anyone how I really felt — honestly, it was like the moment I found out my Mom was diagnosed with Stage 4 Ovarian Cancer. Back then, I was just a teen and there was no way for me to control what was going on. I went into hypomanic overachiever overdrive, not unlike the girl from the movie Let’s do this for Faigy. Her memory should serve as a reason to start talking more about this issue and preventing it from happening to more ambitious leaders.The Head of Product from my former startup came to visit me in NYC a little while ago. He worked out of L.A. and we had only met in person once before. However, we were bicoastally attached at the hip (read: screen) while developing the product. We communicated exclusively on Google Hangout, Google Chat and the phone. When we finally met up in person again, I told him I was writing a memoir about mental illness as it relates to the startup experience. I explained what hypomania was and how it was my superpower in life, but eventually a downfall for my overall health. I told him my scariest stories and what led me to get help. He never knew anything was wrong. After a couple drinks at the bar, my wall broke down for the first time to someone other than my husband. I started rattling off about hypomania and the list of symptoms I experienced. I explained how I was on a swing that went from hypomania to depression, back and forth. His girlfriend nodded her head and faced him. I could see her making check marks as she patted his shoulder. He rarely showed his frustration. We never really talked about it. He just looked tired on Google Hangout. Really, really tired.At first, we were both flying so high — excited about making something beautiful from nothing. Our ideas were fast and furious. We could figure out how to do anything because we were so damn passionate about the company and the future.Talking about our shared experience so freely in the bar that night made me feel better; knowing how well I covered it up for so long made me feel like a rockstar.Content Junkie, Consultant, Feminist, General Assembly Teacher, New Yorker, Writer, Lover of Startups and Anything BedazzledHere there is hope, humor, and help as you deepen your connection to others, yourself, and to your work.

At Keen IO, we work with many bootcamps and have hired a good number of bootcamp grads. Bootcamps (especially those for code) help ease an obvious pain point for growing companies, but they can’t always help bootcamp grads avoid their own pain point — of joining a team that isn’t ready for them.Keen was one of those teams when we hired our first bootcamp grad. We pretty much threw people into the deep end and hoped they could swim. But after some early failures and feedback from those who stuck with us, we are proud to say 7 of our 45 current team members have come from bootcamps. We are even building a learner program to help bootcamp grads land on their feet in their first job — whether or not it’s on our team.In the hopes of helping others learn from our early mistakes, we commissioned this story by the team at If that sounds familiar, you might not be ready to support a team member with less experience (and more questions). Remember that bootcamp grads are coming from an environment of intense learning and cameraderie. Going from that into a situation with almost no mentorship can be jarring and alienating. Plus, it’s ignoring a potential benefit to the senior team.“Your best developers probably learned from someone, so mentorship is likely already part of their life,” says Justin Johnson, who joined Keen in August 2013, a month after graduating from Actions speak louder than words: If senior team members act put-out by questions, new hires aren’t likely to believe you when you tell them to “ask for help anytime.” And even if questions are genuinely encouraged, Keen has learned that occasional reminders are sometimes needed.Keen engineer and bootcamp grad Considering her own experience, she suggests hiring bootcamp grads in pairs “so they have someone else they know is at the same level and they don’t feel stupid asking questions — even though no one ever made me feel stupid here.”When your top priority is to move fast, how can you justify making time to mentor new hires? That’s the philosophy behind Keen’s learner program, which would provide a kind of paid apprenticeship to help bridge the gap between bootcamp and a grad’s first full-time job. Rather than seeing training as a roadblock to growth, they see it as an investment in long-term viability.“Going fast can be seductive,” Josh explains. “You often don’t realise that focusing just on speed can cripple the long-term sustainability of a company — especially if you end up sacrificing team chemistry or culture fit in order to hire people who can simply move fast.”The bonds within a team, like any relationship, are built on trust. And since trust takes time to cultivate, Keen has learned to start relationships long before the interview. Stephanie graduated Hackbright in December 2013, when she also met Keen CEO “I would email Kyle with questions periodically and he would give advice,” Stephanie remembers. “I had very down-to-earth, real interactions with him. My first conversation was actually about how I’m horrible at interviews; we sort of talked about anything and everything.”Stephanie joined Keen in May 2014, but first she worked on a contract project with Taking the initiative and setting your own priorities is a prerequisite for entrepreneurs, so they often assume “radical autonomy” is ideal for everyone. But even “We have a culture that is seriously unusual, where you are empowered to make decisions without asking anyone,” Justin explains.“I kept asking another employee what he thought about investing money going to one event or another,” Justin remembers. “And he would be like, ‘Dude! I don’t care! Treat it like it’s your money and go wherever the hell you want.’”Another way to think about it is, just because someone isn’t running on day one, doesn’t mean they won’t be sprinting soon enough. Bootcamp grads are smart and hard working enough to have learned a brand new skill set in 12 weeks. They deserve at least that long to learn the ropes at a new company.While bootcamp grads are by definition new to their field of study, they also arrive with important expertise and perspectives from their previous work.“Some people have this idea that bootcamp graduates are less valuable than someone who went right from high school to their computer science degree to their first job,” says Aubrey. “That’s totally false because we bring so many new ideas and alternative ways of viewing things.”Plus, many would say the most important skill to succeed at a startup is the ability to manage time and stress while producing high-quality work at a fast pace. In other words, how not to burn out. And you know a great place to learn that skill?

Empiezo dando contexto. Desde los 15 hasta los 22 años trabajé de unas cuantas cosas. Pero sobre todo, de camarero. En cáterings, en fiestas, en eventos puntuales, hasta en el McCafé de un McDonald’s. Esa etapa me dejó claro que, mientras pueda, no volveré a trabajar en hostelería. Pero también aprendí unas cuantas cosas más, bien en ese momento o bien viéndolas con la perspectiva que da el paso del tiempo unida a mis ratos de buceo en Más contexto por si alguien interpreta que estoy aleccionando con soberbia: Si en un proceso de selección escuchas esta frase, activa las alarmas. A veces es una oración dicha de buena fe para expresar la flexibilidad, la confianza entre los miembros del equipo, la buena relación fuera de la oficina, etc.En otras ocasiones es En una familia suele haber un padre y una madre que mandan indiscutiblemente a unos niños que han de obedecer sin rechistar, que para eso son niños. Y ese suele ser el modelo que se importa a las “empresas que son como una familia”: También se suele esconder tras esa frase una especie de buenrollismo en el ambiente que tapa a su vez sueldos bajos, explotación (“hoy todo el mundo se queda hasta que haga falta…”), incapacidad de tomar decisiones, deseo de empleados maleables para que se adapten a cambios como el de un horario peor o una bajada de sueldo “porque no hay más remedio”. Yo hubiese preferido cobrar más de 40 euros por 10 horas poniendo cafés que “estar en una gran familia” que sólo hacía que tapar sus carencias.Creo que es algo que ocurre en todas partes, pero lo he notado especialmente tras venir a vivir a Madrid: Así que supongo que más bien se hace pensando en Cuando arranca un negocio, una startup, lo que sea, es inevitable comenzar trabajando junto a amigos. El mejor ejemplo que recuerdo es el de una encargada bastante competente que cometió el error de contratar a sus amigas. Todas de la misma edad más o menos, unos 30 años en ese momento, intuía que amigas desde hacía bastante tiempo. Sólo podía salir bien si la jefa fijaba esos límites, si de puertas hacia dentro se esfumaba la amistad y se era capaz de tomar decisiones acertadas aunque ello implicara fastidiar a una amiga.Eso, que no suele ocurrir, tampoco sucedió en aquella ocasión. El resultado: cuatro chicas a cada cual más estupenda entre las que era imposible distinguir a la jefa. Tampoco entre ellas parecían poder. Eran cuatro amigas, el resto no estaba nada claro. Un desastre. Para colmo, es fácil que alguna decida tomarse libertades (entrar algo más tarde, no quedarse los peores turnos o tareas…) que el resto van a asociar directamente a su condición de amiga de la jefa. Ahí vienen los celos, el equipo se rompe.LaNormalmente, la figura del camarero está muy muy infravalorada. No digo que a veces sin razón, pero por defecto un camarero se percibe como la persona sin estudios ni demasiado valor en el sector laboral que ha acabado ahí porque no le queda otra. Pues bueno, Lo que hacía especial a ese hombre era que entendía perfectamente Este hombre, Juan Carlos, era un hacha vendiendo. Si había exceso de emperador en la nevera a punto de ponerse malo, lograba convencer a la clientela de que el emperador era la especialidad de la casa y lo proponía cuando todavía nadie tenía claro qué quería cenar. También convencía al dueño de que era buena idea abaratar su precio esa noche para facilitar su salida (de lo contrario, emperador a la basura, lo cual significa dinero a la basura).Viene al hilo de lo anterior. Si todos los negocios son complicados, la hostelería tiene un problema añadido: Por eso es tan importante tener gente que sepa vender en lugar de despachar. Pero La Plaza de la Reina de Valencia, la Plaza Mayor de Madrid, el paseo marítimo de Barcelona. Todas estas zonas comparten la afluencia de turistas, que en hostelería significan “pardillos a quien cobrar más por menos ya que vienen de paso y no van a volver de todas formas”. La materialización de esto es sencilla: La hostelería tradicional lo ha hecho así en buena medida, pero En un cátering en el que trabajé a los 19 tuve a una jefa que estaba ahí porque su jubilado padre, fundador de la empresa, le puso ahí. Ningún otro mérito. Era una negada. No guisaba ni en su casa, nunca había estado al frente de una cocina, no tenía experiencia previa gestionando ningún equipo y en definitiva carecía de cualquier conocimiento básico para su puesto. ¿En qué se tradujo esto? En que el equipo la tomaba a pitorreo.Ella no tenía por qué saber cocinar tan bien como el equipo de cocina, ni tener la agilidad y precisión de los buenos camareros, ni controlar las cuentas con la velocidad y exactitud de la persona encargada. Pero Si no era capaz de diferenciar una dorada de una lubina, no sabía el orden de los cubiertos en mesa, no distinguía la calidad de un vino más allá de su precio y no estaba preparada para hacer una compra (suena a coña pero ya lo he comentado, es una tarea complejísima en un negocio), Hablo de las personas que han heredado un negocio, como la del apartado anterior. Una vez, el gran Jasper dijo con mucha razón que Fue una idea brillante. Como director, debutó siendo totalmente consciente de la dureza de cada uno de esos trabajos. Pudo comprender mejor a cada empleado y al trabajo que tenían que hacer. No exigía de más ni era proclive a engaños como los del punto de arriba.No sólo hablo de que el emprendedor / empresario / fundador tenga un plan B por si un día tiene que cerrar (que también, ese es otro tema). En los negocios peor gestionados puede darse una dependencia total de una sola persona para el trabajo del día a día. Depender de un directivo para la estrategia a medio y largo plazo es lo normal, pero que la rutina salga adelante gracias a una sola persona es negativo. ¿Y si enferma? ¿Y si un día decide marcharse de repente? ¿Y si en un caso extremo se muere? La empresa no puede bloquearse porque un empleado ya no esté.Debe haber gente polivalente capaz de arrimar el hombro temporalmente y conseguir que la ausencia de otro no se note, o tener a alguien en la recámara, o… Al menos, un plan. Lo escribió, ampliado, mucho mejor que yo Juan Hernando en su blog: Suena a obvio y debería ser bastante obvio, pero me temo que no siempre es así: eHay quien no es conciente del cambio de vida que implica abrir un restaurante, y eso lo vi yo mismo. Meterse en la hostelería tiene algunas implicaciones:La hostelería es complicada, muy complicada, y muy sacrificada, y en España tenemos la imagen de que se abren bares y restaurantes porque “son negocios que funcionan solos”.PD: Todos mis argumentos admiten enmienda.

This week someone came to ask my advice with regards to the new Internet Startup he was bootstrapping. He holds an MBA. He has a cofounder. His cofounder holds an MBA.He was planning to be the CEO and his cofounder the CFO. I asked him who would talk to investors. He said it would be the CFO’s role. I asked him who would build the product. They are outsourcing the engineering and design team altogether. It did not make sense to me because:So after he told me about his product and business model, the first thing I suggested was to reconsider his founder-team strategy. Of course it’s hard to But why did he get into that situation (2 MBAs) in the first place?IWhat happened next?MBAs are good critical thinkers, project managers or sales people, but poor bootstrapping executors because they are often generalists, not “experts”. Your startup needs to have complementary skills. MBAs have the same skills (Certainly people have previous backgrounds where they are subject matter experts, but then you are picking your cofounder for his or her previous background skills, not for her MBA.)Startups need designers, researchers, developers and hustlers. If you are the MBA, you are the hustler. Find the other roles.Absolutely. My cofounders at Traity.com were my friends before. However, they were very complementary in knowledge and experience. One of them holds a PhD in the area of work, he is a critical thinker. Another one is a software development guru, a massive executor. I hold an MBA and trouble maker. We were friends from many years ago and we took different paths. When we came together to work on this, we had the right complementary skill-set in terms of knowledge and experience.So make sure those friends are not the same mind in a different body. You will have fun, will share things and will want to plan the vision together. But if both have the same background, experience and especially if they have MBAs and cannot code or design, nothing will get done. Look for complementarity.Ideas are worth very little in most cases. It´s all about execution. Is your friend the right person to execute with? Do they have the same passion as you do? The same commitment and time? That alone is already unlikely to happen. Most people are likely to say “they will commit”, because nobody wants to be out of an opportunity, but few people actually take the steps .Even if they do, and if they are an absolute pleasure to be with and one of your best friends, if you don’t have a complementary job for that person, you need to discuss it, as early as possible, and find a solution to the fact that working together is unlikely to lead to the right outcome.The problem of MBA programs is that most of them hold entrepreneurship courses and competitions as stand alone institutions. This proves how little they know about startups.Let me give you a real example. In Madrid, where I am from, you have the MBA at IE, regularly on the top 10 worldwide MBA rankings. People from IE have no idea about where to find technical talent. IE has its own startup competition, full of MBA teams. I bet their ideas rarely get executed.At the same time, my friends from the Madrid University of Technology UPM, one of the top technical universities in Europe, has no idea about where to find business talent. UPM has its own startup competition, full of Engineers. They know nothing about market fit.The schools live happily 2 miles apart, with no connection between them whatsoever. It’s a real shame that MBA schools and Technical schools cannot come together and partner to create proper competitions, courses and “cofounder dating” events so they can find real complementarity.The only example I know where this happens is MIT, where they help MBAs from Sloan meet PhDs from the technical schools. This is how stuff happens.If you have an MBA and plan to bootstrap a startup, find people who are truly complementary. They are likely to be subject matter or industry experts (this might be you), PhDs, developers and designers.Founder CEO 

In mid 2012, Maybe it was because of boredom, or overly zealous curiosity, but we decided to look into how they were collecting payments through the Authorize.net integration we‘d implemented. In  2 years, they’d processed almost $500k. We had no funding, and although I’d previously founded a pretty successful company, no real experience. I jumped in full time, and learned all I could from We launched 4 months later with a handful of clients from previous relationships. Our biggest hassle early on, was with credit card processors; Samurai  First Data  PayPal  WePay  Stripe  Balanced (Over the next few months we grew modestly. I spoke to lots of event organizers and we continued to iterate; even though truthfully, I’m not sure we knew that’s what we were doing. We decided to apply to One of the key takeaways from YC was to change our name. We were starting to expand beyond just sports, and the product was becoming much more sophisticated. So we changed our name to We raised $100k from a small group of angels. Dave came on full time. We kept building. I kept talking to customers. We continued to grow. Then, we hit the magic of compounded growth. Here’s what our graph looked like.That summer, we applied to We got in, and moved to Mountain View 6 days later. I left my wife and 2 daughters behind in Florida. Dave postponed his wedding, (he did get married in March 2014). Needless to say, we racked up a lot of frequent flier miles over the next 5 months, and grew to understand how blessed we were to have understanding spouses. We hired 2 more engineers. We continued to grow. We hit Then something happened. Through countless hours of pitching potential investors, analyzing the business exhaustively, and some deep soul searching, We were spending a disproportionate amount of engineering time building payments elements into the system: Onboarding, Price Levels, Promo Codes, Payouts, Reporting, Testing, Chargeback Rules, Fraud Protection, Refunds…We were handling millions of dollars in payments, across hundreds of thousands of transactions, for thousands of merchants, with multiple payment processors running in parallel.We had built our own agnostic payments platform, to allow us to access the unique abilities and benefits of different payments companies. What our customers really wanted was a sophisticated way to accept payments, unencumbered by the constraints of the payments industry. That’s what we’d been building; without realizing it. So we decided we were going to split LaunchTrack’s IP off from the payments infrastructure, and sell the IP related to registration/ticketing. This would allow us to focus on building an entirely new business around this key learning: We could have spent another *n months working on the sale, but that was exactly the type of distraction we needed to avoid. Plus, there was a customer service component that also needed to be considered. The new acquirer met our previous LOI’s terms, but with a much cleaner transition plan.

Six years ago, my co-founder For us, ‘different’ meant many things: it was about doing work that helped us fulfil our potential — work that would allow us to look back and say we hadn’t wasted our time on earth working for a cause we didn’t believe in.So we built We vowed that if the organisation ever grew beyond the two of us we’d make sure it mirrored our ‘do something different’ philosophy. This would include doing things differently everywhere in the organisation — from the people we hired to the products we offered.Unfortunately, our legal company structure said otherwise.

When money is the only thing that matters, bad habits — short-termism, a preference for hyper-efficiency over individual human experience, blindness to environmental concerns — are all too easy to fall into.

Five years. That’s over 15% of my life. If I was going to write a book about it, the chapters would look something like this:Chapter 1: Find a need and fill itBut this is not a book, so I will summarize instead. It’s actually way simpler than all that: Show up every day and work your ass off.And then do it again tomorrow. And the day after that. And after that.Keep doing that, for five years, and then you will have a startup that is five years old. It takes nothing more, but importantly, nothing less.Just keep working. That’s the secret. Show up. And work.Two parts Uncle Jesse. One part Zack Morris. Founder

If you ask any 30-something if they would like to start a company, odds are they would say “Yes.” But ask a 30-something working parent the same question, you’d probably get a “#$@%*! No!” (Profanity optional).It’s because parenting  child care are a lot of work. And the workload is getting bigger.According to the Pew Research Center, the average amount of time spent per week on child care by both mothers and fathers have As a parent of a 2-year old and a co-founder of a tech company myself, I’ve done my share of changing diapers, feeding, and reading stories and I’ve found it hard to mix them with pushing code to GitHub, and doing customer development, and designing the mobile app user experience.

If you have a job and/or steady income and you’re a parent, you’d probably be hard-pressed to trade the security for uncertainty.You might say that there are grants and government support for new businesses. That is correct, but the pool dries up a bit for the 30-something entrepreneurs as a lot of the grants are for younger entrepreneurs (age 18–29). In Canada, If we really want our economy to thrive, we need to rethink how parents are integrated into the small business sector. I say we definitely need to do more of these:Support can come in a variety of forms: trying their software, buying their app, sharing their blog posts, liking their Facebook pages, or following them on Twitter.A lot of startups primarily run on the founder’s passion and any form of support is like rocket fuel (or a If a friend of yours is considering starting a business but is apprehensive about financial commitments to his or her family, try not to douse the spark of the idea.Instead, suggest to them to validate their idea first.

One of the questions most commonly asked by our clients here at This is a tough question. Every idea warrants its own marketing strategy, especially with something that ties into its launch strategy. Some ideas that we work on require careful planning to ensure users are on the platform day one for it to work. For others, they need to keep things secret because of the intellectual property being built. You need to be strategic, but you also need to be smart.With that mentioned, one of the biggest rules of thumb that we give all of our clients is to not share hype until the following items are completed (This one should be a no-brainer. Think about what you are doing. You are giving someone a first impression of your new brand, your new product, the thing that you have poured your blood, sweat, tears, money and gray hairs into. When you announce something prematurely before the design of the product is finalized or a brand is in place, you often will not have a user seeing the full picture of what it is that you envision.This is a bad strategy. Think about what happens if you decide to change the user interface design before jumping into code. What happens if you decide that your brand needs a better identity or a completely different name? The early viewers of your company would relate to you or remember you when it comes time to launch. Worst of all, no one cares early on about you changing the name of your company because you haven’t provided them with any value yet.Don’t make this rookie mistake. Patience is a virtue — and especially when it comes to showing a product that will resemble the completed product later on, a brand that will remain constant for years to come, and a typeface + color scheme that people will remember. Don’t jump the gun and cause the equivalent of a startup false start. You can’t afford to lose five yards this early on in the game.This is another huge rule of thumb we share with all of our clients here at Digest that for a second. Months out before someone can use your product. Do you believe they will remember you six months from now once you launch? No, it is very unlikely. If you build hype too early, it will die out before you launch. Think of all the companies you hear about and forget. Can’t remember them? There is a reason to this.So why wait until product development? Typically, this is the homestretch of product building. You are in the most straight-forward stage of a product, making things come to life and starting to see it become a reality (This is the biggest piece of advice that we at As your product is being built, the story becomes clearer. Do not mistake having a strong vision with having a story. The story comes later as you can see your product, begin using your product, and start seeing how your brand will interact with your target audience. You need the storytelling to properly build hype to begin with, to get people interested in what you are doing and why it can provide a positive impact in their lives too.Three simple guidelines above, but guidelines that are highly recommended. Of course, as mentioned before, every company is different with different requirement. You may not want to be build pre-launch hype at all. That’s okay. If you do though, no matter what your strategy is, follow the guidelines step above. They will always apply and will ensure that you are focusing on the quality route of launching a new startup, not the quantity route.I build products and grow companies. Founder of ChopDawg.com.

My Product Hunt story starts with a lie I told Erik Torenberg.Erik is part of Product Hunt’s founding team, and he cold emailed me last year:I only had a vague idea what Product Hunt was. So of course I told Erik I was a huge fan.I’m going to embarrass myself by quoting my email:I know, I know; let’s all pause and laugh at my transparent BS.The funniest thing is that I ended up getting sucked into the vortex of interesting that is Product Hunt, and am now BTW — if you don’t know what Product Hunt is, then you’ve been living under the same rock I was a few months ago. Basically, Product Hunt is a discovery platform where people can submit new and interesting tech-focused products, and the community can discuss them and upvote them if they like them, sort of like Reddit for tech products.I’m not here to tell you how great Product Hunt is for users. Internally, we debated whether or not it made sense to launch on Product Hunt, since, like I said, we don’t have a traditional tech product. What we do is offer a service that takes an author from idea to professionally published book, and all they have to do is spend about 12 hours on the phone with us. Of course we use lots of different technologies to accomplish this, but most of the hard parts of our process are done by very skilled editors and writers, not software. We plan to eventually create a SaaS product that makes our service more widely available (it’s very expensive right now because of the skilled labor aspect), but until we do that, we’re just not a tech company.We Here is the data from our launch on February 24th, 2015 to March 31st, 2015 (5 full weeks):This might not look like much, until you realize that our services start at 15k. Which means the The one thing Product Hunt But we did get something I did not expect: We launched about two weeks prior to SXSW (I live in Austin, 4 blocks from the convention center, so I kinda have to go to SXSW, even if I don’t want to). I would estimate that I met about 400 people during SXSW, and at least 100 of them said that they had heard of my company because of Product Hunt. They We also had several investors reach out to us wanting to talk about maybe getting in our seed round. The only problem is that Here’s another cool thing about Product Hunt that I think very few people actually understand: When you launch on Kickstarter, if you don’t do have a serious press and launch strategy, your project will probably flounder. The platform itself is not enough. All we did for Product Hunt was push this out to our personal social media accounts.Yes, I have a lot of social media followers (350k+ on twitter, 500k+ on Facebook), but a very low percentage of those people care about my company or are on Product Hunt. In fact, Twitter’s analytics say my tweet only pushed about a few thousand views to Product Hunt.The point is this, and it is powerful: Product Hunt has it’s own audience, and it is responsive and actively looking for new things. You don’t need to build an audience, Furthermore, the community is great. People comment on products, ask questions, and generally engage the makers. And since it’s not anonymous, the community tends to be respectful and nice, and ask serious questions.One thing I should warn you about: the community there is great, but they are not push-overs. They are very intelligent and sophisticated, and you can’t talk to them like an advertiser or marketer addressing a bunch of captive dolts. They will ask hard questions, and judge you based on how you respond. You have to be real and answer their questions directly and honestly, or they will see through your BS and not engage you or your product.The only person you can easily BS is Erik Torenberg ☺.So to sum up, Product Hunt is awesome, and I highly recommend you use it, even if you don’t fit their traditional product profile.CEO of Book In A Box (

One year after our eFounders’ letter #1 “We have been building 9 startups so far. Four of them are completely independent (When you create something new, most people in your ecosystem are either ignorantly critical or acceptably skeptical. Building a startup studio is very innovative: there are very few, maybe no structures like us, that have successively and regularly built startups that have become truly independent. There are other structures that resemble our model — early stage investors, coaches, accelerators, incubators — but very few are The only well-known structure that can be referred as startup studio is the (in)famous Our second and main difference with Rocket Internet’s model is that we aim at creating independent companies. Rocket’s companies are internally — or almost internally — financed, and they are strongly tied to Rocket Internet’s resources. It makes it more difficult for them to emancipate from the Rocket Internet group and to build their own culture. At eFounders, we are building companies that are bound to be independent within 18 months.The Startup Studio model is new and needs to be evangelised. Whereas we had no problem convincing European VCs of our network to invest in our companies, it has been much more complicated talking with US counterparts. The problem was not the model itself but the capitalisation table: we had the feeling that we were giving away a huge amount of shares for free to our co-founders — about one third — yet we realized it was not perceived as such by US investors. We decided to slightly change our model: we now divide the shares equally between us and each co-founder (CEO and CTO). We also realized skepticism came from US stakeholders when our venture There are many people who don’t understand or don’t want to understand what we are doing. We don’t blame them, we blame ourselves for not communicating the right way. We are about to communicate much more, now that we know better who we are and where we go.After a while, it became obvious that we, also, are a startup, just like any of the startups we are building. It sounds silly, but while focusing all our efforts and resources to each of our startups, we just forgot that we also had similar issues. We’ve learned that we should apply to ourselves the structure and the rigor we impose to our companies in order to scale properly.To be fully honest we didn’t realize that we were growing too fast. This awareness directly came from our projects that blamed us for not being structured, helpful and demanding enough. When we started eFounders, there was only We have still many important recruitments to do over the next months but we intend to stay a small team — around 15 people. As we are not to be involved in our projects after the 18 months there is no reason for us to be a bigger team as long as we develop not more than a few projects a year. We have decided to impose ourselves the same structural rules that we impose our startups, for instance the Sunday Evening Agenda that I send to everyone each week, and the Monday morning meeting that we hold for general issues. Even though it is still an ongoing process and will certainly always be, we have made some progress as of the time I am writing this letter.Being a high growth startup with a growing team also means developing our own culture. We’ve been implementing initiatives to go into that direction in the past few months, and it is going very well. The mood in the office is excellent and mixing brilliant creative, business and tech talents creates a very inspiring environment. eFounders is building its own DNA that will hopefully be partially transferred to our projects.We positioned eFounders on SaaS and more largely on what we call B2B “Being short in finding good ideas is what scares some people about the startup studio model but it is actually the less challenging part. The key to our idea fuel is that we start with a market we want to address and then figure out what is the best way to address it. There are some very exciting ideas that can explained in few seconds and look very promising. There are also “We are always super excited about our new startups and I must say that I am very confident about what is coming. They might not be all successful but they actually result from a long and collective thinking. They are certainly worth the try.Startup’s independency is crucial for us. If a company needs us for more than 18 months, it means we won’t have the resources to build new companies, which is the basis of our model. The first batch of companies we’ve created didn’t exactly follow this model: We basically “did” before we even know what we were doing exactly. We were 3 partners with complementary skills acting as co-founders in many startups at the same time. We were discovering what we wanted to be and what our values were while we were building these companies. As a consequence, some people had to change positions among our co-founders, and we had to maintain our roles in operations for a longer period of time than expected — Quentin even became CEO of Mailjet for a short period of time. Of course, this was not the best way of handling our model. Ideally, we would like the technical and business co-founders to stay during the entire company lifetime, and we don’t plan to be involved in operations for more than 18 months.This means that recruiting the right co-founders is crucial for a startup studio that values companies’ independency above all, like us. As we explained in the We’ve also realized that a company’s independence means both not depending on any eFounders’ resources but also preferably located elsewhere. Textmaster understood that pretty early and it helped a lot for reaching their global independency. Mention, which was located in Mailjet’s offices, just moved across the street earlier this month. Sharing an office does not make companies stronger: it is their ability to take advantage of each other’s networks that can empower them. That is why we are not trying to gather everybody at the same place but we are building tools to give companies the advantages of a shared network.Finally, we’ve realized that building a startup that is bound to become independent means that we should not be involved in follow-up investments with VCs. Being very involved in the construction of our startups, we are very aware of their fundamentals and it is sometimes tempting to follow up some investments along with the VCs. We have succumbed to the temptation for some of our startups but we will not do that anymore. External investors really help for startup independency. It is important to know where you stand: regarding eFounders, we have decided to sit on the founder’s side.Since day one, eFounder’s goal has not only been to build successful companies but also to create an asset that makes it possible to give more chance for startups to succeed. Increasing the chance of success comes from 3 different ways: hiring better people, be better at execution and offering unfair advantages.Hiring better people actually requires 2 things: always getting great talents to apply, and having a great recruitment process. After 3 years of existence, we’re starting to get some visibility, a good reputation and an attractive model that makes more and more talented people apply to eFounders. We are not really advertising for our jobs because we prefer people to come to us instead of us getting to them. Concerning the recruitment process, it is getting better and better since we are using Quality in execution is something that can be drastically improved over time. Good execution requires good people and great processes. Building a good software is hard: not only does it require the best developers, designers and architects but it also requires discipline and organisation. Projects after projects, we’ve improved the way we are structuring the development (technology choices, interactions, tools, time management) to stay agile and efficient at the same time. The same conclusion applies to any other kind of execution: getting visibility, acquiring clients, building a community. Offering unfair advantages is at the same time the most scalable and the most challenging asset we can build, because it mainly relies on the dynamism of our network: a difficult thing to maintain. In order for our community to remain truly active, we have gathered it around one concept: the As an illustration of how the Network runs on a daily basis, we all rely on Our next big challenge is finding our business model. Our main issue is a treasury issue: running the structure costs a lot of money and the only revenue we can count on are startups’ exits. Knowing that the average time for a startup to exit is 7 year, it means that meanwhile, the structure has to get financed. Until now, we — Quentin Nickmans and I — have been personally investing our money but we will need external money if we want to continue to grow at some point. We took some time to define the best way to welcome external investors and we are currently in the process of raising money.So far, it has been an amazing adventure. First, because we are creating something new, where everything has to be invented: the way we structure ourselves, the people we should work with, the way we should communicate, the way we will get financed. Second, because it is an incredible adventure to work with amazing entrepreneurs, to disrupt industries, to transform a crazy idea into a successful product or service. It is highly intense because we are living the ups and downs of each of our startups all together. We have very optimistic signs but we still have to prove everything. We know that we still have a long way and certainly many obstacles to overcome, but the adventure is very exciting and definitely worth it.Founder Together with entrepreneurs, we turn unique ideas into successful companies. We act as the perfect co-founder to build strong and independent startups. You can also check out our Tech Blog “Unexpected Token” and SaaS newsletter “SaaSClub”.

Almost 1 year ago, I opened up my seed round to people who use At the time, as to be expected with all new processes (especially those involving federal securities regulations), the steps required to complete the 25 transactions with the individual and institutional investors was arduous. One of the biggest barriers to actually getting a wire into the company’s account was the requirement that all investors be confirmed as ‘Accredited Investors’, and that I had taken substantial steps to prove their status. One of my investors was so frustrated by the process dictated by the SEC that they Unfortunately, there were other problems too — many of the people who love and use While I would have gladly had them join me, I was barred by the SEC from doing so. We all found this slightly insulting and obnoxious, considering some of the cheques were as low as $1k, coming from people earning $200k/year. These people were fully aware of the risks they were taking, and imho were more educated about their decision than most public market investors. Of the people who expressed interest in investing in Quibb, I had to politely say ‘Sorry, I can’t take your money!’ to ~50% of them.New rules associated with Title IV of the Beyond filing a single unaudited statement, companies raising less than $20M can do so without disclosing financial statements, and are not required to undergo state securities law regulations in each of the states where a sale occurs.At this level, the company will be subject to semi-annual updates, annual audits, reporting of material events, and otherwise be reviewed at the federal level. Hoever, they’re exempt from traditional state ‘blue-sky’ regulations (considered costly and time-consuming).Either of these formats allow the company to sell common and preferred stock, debt, options, or warrants. Both tiers are incredibly permissive, as Regulation A previously only allowed companies to raise $5M/year, with many more requirements. After these updates to be published in the Federal Register, they become law 60 days later.The announcement mentions investor protections, ones that I believe are impactful yet would have allowed my company to access a broader range of keen investors. They include ‘bad actor’ background checks on the companies, disclosure of the company’s financial information, and (for Tier 2) limits investors to investing 10% of their annual income or net worth.I wouldn’t be surprised to see startups that are running products with tightly knit communities, those with legions of fans, or a distributed and engaged workforce — and OK with the idea of sharing some financial information — turning to those people to raise their next round of funding, and potentially continuing on that path every year.— — —canadian marooned in silicon valley. creator of disruptive innovention. metaincubation expert. mini-dino breeder. music moralist. ironic twitter bio writer.

To say that Hong Kong’s startup ecosystem is growing, is an understatement! It’s booming! As more and more success stories pile up, HK is beginning to stake its claim as one of Asia’s hottest startup hubs.To be honest, there isnt one particular industry that Hong Kong entrepreneurs belong to. Yes, we are inherently well-suited to FinTech thanks to our legacy of being Asia’s financial headquarters. And hardware, while easier said than done, is becoming the weapon of choice for many — attributable, of course, to the proximity to the world’s hardware capital Shenzhen.

This year was the year eFounders focused on structuring itself. For the past 12 months, we haven’t officially launched any new project. We rather placed efforts on raising funds: 4 different rounds of funding happened this year in eFounders’ galaxy, including ourselves. Aircall raised aThe coming months are going to be pretty busy. We want to launchWhen we are looking for founders for our new projects, the first thing we ask ourselves is: is the founder an entrepreneur? As the definition of an entrepreneur is sometimes very fuzzy, I always try to sum it up to two aspects: Illustrio faced the greatest of challenges: we had to find a new CEO. It has been an incredibly hard decision to make because we had built an emotional relationship with him, and because he is a truly skilled person. But there was a mismatch with the team and we did what we had to do to keep the project alive. Much less important but still critical, we had to change the name of our OfficeX project from Tipi to Hivy. We had decided to name it Tipi (with domain name jointipi.com). The day the brand was registered — 3 months after submitting the brand registration form — we were contacted by TipiMail, one of Mailjet’s competitor. TipiMail had been registered months ago and the founders were convinced that we registered the brand Tipi on purpose to parasite its brand identity. Of course, it was absolutely not the case, but there was no reasoning him and we decided to change our brand. It’s been a challenge, for the brand, for the team and for the tech, but we are now very happy with our new name,We also had to abandon a project for the first time, Solved. The idea behind Solved was to create a 24/7 support service for software related issues. If you had a problem with any software (like Excel or Google Analytics) you could contact one of Solved’s experts directly by clicking on an icon on your computer. Experts would answer live with video and screen sharing. We were able to quickly build a community of experts but we couldn’t find clients willing to pay for the service, although Solved’s founders went to the Silicon Valley and met tens executives in charge of training in several companies. Without traction, we realized that we had built a product people like, but didn’t really want. Although killing a project is extremely hard, because of all the time, energy and resources invested, we decided it was the right decision. In retrospect, I’m glad we did it soon enough — before incorporating the company, which would have entailed complicated legal issues.It has been a truly humbling experience for us. We keep repeating Paul Graham’s famous quote which eventually became YC’s baseline: “Something went wrong in our process for two reasons: 1. we overestimated the perceived value created by our product and 2. we misunderstood the go-to-market strategy. A “bottom-up strategy” was not possible because we build something employees don’t need (or don’t know they need) and a “top-down selling” was impossible because we didn’t find who was the right manager to sell the product to. In the future, weOur two latest companiesIt doesn’t mean that we want to start all our companies there. Every startup is considered separately and the decision depends on the target market and initial traction. Two of our companies are incorporated in Belgium, 2 in France and 2 in the US. We usually create the company 9 months after starting a new project. Before the incorporation, the company is incubated at eFounders. It gives us time to understand our product and market, and to find the most appropriate place to set up the company.In terms of financing, the fight is totally unequal between the US and the rest of the world. Typical seed financing is around €1M in Europe for a €3M valuation. You can at least double those figures for successful startups in the U.S. The difference is so big that it is almost stupid for a company with a global product (with no regional bias) and traction in the U.S not to incorporate as a Delaware company.Don’t get me wrong, it is not that easy to raise funds in the US. The competition is very strong and being visible above the crowd is not an easy task when you come from the far far East. Front, our first “U.S” company at eFounders attended YCombinator’s Summer 2014 batch. In addition to offering a strong visibility and access to a large network, one of the biggest upside of YC is to make the company come and stay in the US for 3 months. Just by going here and by having to become a US entity gives the company more chance to raise money. Building a trusted network takes a long time and we recommend our founders to stay at least 2 months. It is the time you need to start meeting the right people and earning their confidence. It is so important to have a steady local presence that we are thinking about having a foot anchored there.It’s also complicated for a startup coming from a startup studio to get financed by VCs, especially in the Valley. It is actually much harder than in Europe where Rocket Internet paved the way to this new model. Although there is a proliferation of famous startups studios like Expa, Betaworks and again more recently Pioneer Square Labs, American VCs are still very skeptical about the model. Startup Studios do not meet their idea of what Entrepreneurship should be, regarding their standards. I always wonder whether they are badly influenced by copy-cat models like Rocket internet’s, which seem to contradict their idea of “innovation”, or if they think entrepreneurship can only have one color. What I know for sure is that if they are too reluctant to invest in studios’ startups, they take the chance to be bypassed. Getting VC financing is really healthy for our startups. In addition to fixing a fair valuation to the company, it makes it more independent from the studio and it increases chances for making an exit. More and more funds are interested in investing in tech and especially in Europe, LPs are looking for alternative models. If Startup Studios directly get money by LPs then there won’t be any reason for Studios to go through venture capitalists anymore. And it is just happening right now.You may know the“The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital.” says Warren Buffett. It is important to understand what your strengths are as a studio. I wrote an article aboutHowever, it is important not to miss opportunities. If we are good at creating pieces of software for millions of businesses, we might be good at selling it to consumers, as well. We didn’t make the move so far, but we are very interested in something that some people callWe fully adhere to Marc Andreessen’s words “Software is eating the world”. Finding an area where software can bring value is not a big deal — what we want, is to find some areas where introducing a piece of software can completely disrupt and reinvent an experience. Most of the time, it is not about replacing a paper or Excel sheets by an iso-functional software, it is about rethinking the business regarding the state of the art (in term of usage and technology). You don’t invent electrical cars only by replacing the gas engine by an electrical one but by imagining how the entire experience is affected. Likewise, you don’t reinvent insurance by putting the broker online.Ever since eFounders’ genesis, and even more in the future, we will try to get off the beaten track in order to create unique applications that revamp entire experiences.I have seen more and more entrepreneurs who are jumping into the startup world without having a deep conviction of the problem they want to solve. The “lean philosophy” can give the illusion that you don’t need to know where you head to, that your path will build as you walk. These entrepreneurs usually identify a small problem. They build the product to face this problem and if this turns out to be a solution, they iterate based on clients’ feedback. This approach could lead to solving an important problem and open a big opportunity for a business — or not. Lean Entrepreneurs know how to walk, but they don’t know where they go to. Great entrepreneurs have a vision of the big picture and restrict the application of the lean philosophy for what it was created for: product management. They know where to go and they define their path along the way. They are eager to iterate at every step and they confront the market very early on with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). I really think that lean philosophy has much more sense when applied to product management that to the startup world itself.At eFounders, we spend a lot of time trying to teach and implement this philosophy. We want our founders to know where they want to go, the problem they want to solve, from day one. We take small steps to reach the goal as long as things are not clear. We only take much bigger steps when we realize we are on the right path. In any case we expose our solution to future clients very early on. We usually divide our go-to-market strategy into 2 steps. The first step is the creation of the MVP on which we on-board very early on few pilot users. This phase last between 4 and 6 months depending on the project’s complexity. It is the BUILD phase. Just after this phase comes the SCALE phase. During that stage we activate communication, marketing and PR levers in order to make the service visible and increase the size of the customer database.Having a multi-disciplinary team executing these steps can be tricky, considering some tasks require more maturity and a better knowledge of the product. We have had a tendency to allow resources on design, marketing or communications too early. Now we try to limit ourselves to only two tasks only during the BUILD phase. We focus all our efforts on thinking and developing the Each and every startup studio out there has its own type and its specificities. Since the beginning of eFounders’ adventure, we‘ve not only been interested in building our own startup studio, but also very curious about the studio model in itself. Startups studios are creating a brand new approach to entrepreneurship. One century ago, you would have launched your startup on your own or with a member of your family. 10 years ago, you would have found yourself one cofounder or two to cover the large set of skills required to launch a tech startup. With today’s technology and access to knowledge, it’s easier to launch a startup; yet it is more and more difficult to stand out from the crowd. Even though it is always possible to start a successful company on your own from your garage, the biggest recent successes have been boosted by incubators and accelerators. The logical next step is the rise of startup studios. They are inventing collaborative entrepreneurship. Starting a company is not the result of one or two individuals anymore, but the work of an entire team.Our interest in the concept of startup studios has grown to the point where we decided to share it more widely and evangelize it in the startup world. We built a database containing more thanTo understand them better we developed a strict Internal Idea, Repetition, and Platform are the 3 criteria that define startup studios. This strict definition reduces the number of established startup studios to a dozen. Among these “true” studios, two approaches are coexisting, the “integrated” and the “independent” model. The goal of eFounders is to build companies that will become completely independent within the next 18 months. Rocket creates companies that are very bound to the studio. Even years after their creation, Rocket’s companies share financial, operational, human, and technical links with their underlying companies. Although we are very proud of creating stand-alone companies, we are not completely against the idea of either having less share in a startup but being less involved (“lightstack model”) or on the contrary, taking much more shares but being much longer and deeper dedicated (“full stack model”). Today we will continue to do as we have done since the beginning, but that could change depending on the opportunities.Since the beginning of eFounders, my co-founder Quentin and I financed everything ourselves. Building a startup studio is very expensive and that’s one of the reasons they are usually created by founders who previously sold a company. The Samwers brothers created Rocked Internet after selling Alando to eBay and Jamba! to Verisign; likewise, Garrett Camp created Expa after the acquisition of Stumble Upon by eBay and the creation of Uber.SaaS startups exit after 7 years in average. It means that there is a gap of 7 years between the moment you create the first startup and the time you get your first coin back. It means that 7 years have to be financed, years during which you have to pay for every company you create. For the first 3 years, we were a team of 3 plus some freelancers. In addition to financing our companies, we also decided to invest money in the following rounds. It is very frustrating to be diluted when you really believe in the company you have been building. All in all, we have personally invested $5 million to both start and finance the 5 companies we have created.We thought about getting money from external investors for a long time. At the very beginning of eFounders, we even naively met VC funds and ask them to invest in eFounders. We basically got a “No” as an answer and multiple reasons. They couldn’t invest in a “Funds of Funds” or they didn’t get the sense of the model. In retrospect, we are very lucky that they said no. We prefer to have VCs investing in our companies rather than in our Studio.However, it was becoming personally very risky to continue to finance it on our own. We then decided, before finding a scalable and durable way to finance the studio, to welcome someone we could trust and who could bring hard money and strong skills. Oleg, my previous partner at Fotolia, joined the adventure in June by injecting $6 million. Oleg invested very early on in Fotolia and instantly brought his experience and intelligence to make the company meet its potential. He led Fotolia as its CEO for the last 6 years and made its acquisition by Adobe happen. He is very honest, extremely kind, creative and an excellent business man. He was exactly the kind of person we wanted to have with us.Now, we have to find a way to give eFounders the financial infrastructure for a sustainable balance. We came to the idea of a financial vehicle that will invest in our companies and will work as a studio itself. It means that the money will not only be used to invest but also to build the companies. The fund will finance early-stage phases from pre-seed to big seed/small series A. We are thinking about raising $15–20M to invest in companies that we build in the next two years. The money will finance the studio and the companies themselves. The capital of the startup will be shared between the studio eFounders, the financial vehicle, the partnership and the co-Founders. We might later raise a second vehicle that will be set up as a traditional fund and will be dedicated to follow-on using eFounders’ pro-rata. Privileged access to this fund will be granted to investors of the first fund.Partnership is key for a long term venture. From day one we have understood that it was important to welcome great talent in eFounders’s capital. This way, we make sure that high-skilled and entrepreneurial-minded people get involved in the long run. Four years ago, Didier Forest, aged 23, joined us as a creative partner. We expect partners to be as involved as we are in the present and future of the studio.eFounders is a startup. As a startup, it is very important to share its capital with key people in order to get and retain the best talents. Most startups are structuring employee’s participation through a stock options pool with a 4 years vesting. eFounders should last a long time and a partnership structure would then seem more appropriate. The Partnership program will incentivize special employees for the time they stay in the structure. Active partners will own shares directly in created companies and through eFounders. It is more complicated to setup than a traditional stock option pool but it is the only solution we found to incentivize partners for the long run. The famous accelerator YCombinator, VC firms like a16z or Sequoia or most of lawyer corps work with a partnership structure.The previous year was all about structuring eFounders in order to build solid roots for a sustainable startup studio. Now that we have good foundations, it is high time we erected the pyramid. We expect to launch at least 4 businesses in the next 12 months and start 4/5 new ones. We have new offices both in Paris and Brussels, we have a very talented team and a large inbound flow of amazing founders. We have all the ingredients to keep on creating successful and independent companies. We hold all the cards, now let’s play them. What I certainly am the proudest of is that we have created companies that have their own culture. Startup studios are often criticized for the lack of uniqueness of their startups, and it is something we fight against since day one. Today we have built 5 different startups and I am very glad to say that they each have their own DNAs. That has been achieved because formidable founders always deeply make their mark and empower their companies. That’s is the material from which unicorns are made of.Read more:Founder Together with entrepreneurs, we turn unique ideas into successful companies.

I was 18, when I played A week after that I played poker on the first ever Russian poker TV show, sponsored by I was supposed to be there for one game only and “dilute a crowd of nerdy looking guys-poker players”. I ended up playing 3 games, including the final one, getting the 2nd place and going to the Grand finale of EPT (European poker tour) in Monaco. My “poker career” ended almost right after I got back from Monaco — poker was banned in Russia, where I lived back then, and I needed to finish my studies.Now I live in Copenhagen and run my company Once you are in a game, your strategy is driven not only by your position or your cards but also by, how many chips you have in your stack. Less chips you have — less picky you should be with cards and more aggressive with your actions. Waiting for the best cards might cost you all your money, so it will be eaten up by blinds.I find it similar to fundraising in startups.In No-Limit Texas Hold’em, you are playing on a “short stack” and in a need to take an action, once you have less than 40 big blinds. In a startup you usually start looking for investments once you have less, than 6 months of the runway.Every founder wants to find the right investor and smart money. But you don’t always get to choose. Once you are the short stack — you take the money or you’re out of the game.Best poker players know, what differs good players from lucky ones.As a game, based on the theory of probabilities, in poker you might hit the downswing (or how people like calling it — bad luck), when nothing works out, and even your Startup founders often face same struggle and frustration. One day — everything is perfect: investors chase you, clients are happy and your team is just rocking. The other day — you lose the investors, Apple doesn’t approve your app, your best (and may be the only) developer leaves the team.Running a startup is a roller coaster, so is playing poker. The best advice I’ve heard so far is:Get one lucky day for a startup is easy. Run a successful startup for months and years is really hard.Bankroll management is basic for poker. It helps you to understand at what limits you can play (depending on a game, the limit is a buy-in or blinds).In general, bankroll management helps to minimise your risks by picking the right “price” for a game, so if you don’t win, you still have money to play other games.For example, you have $100 ready to spend on NL Texas Hold’em games. Usually, you won’t go for a game with a buy-in more, than $2–2.5 or, perhaps, even $1–1.5. It allows you to keep going, even if you lost one game.I try to apply this rule in my startup as well, even though it might be hard to make the similar calculation. Investments or a projected revenue can leave an impression, that you got the money and can afford it — new office, fancy laptops, new team members.Ask yourself — how does it affect your bankroll? What if all your clients are gone tomorrow? All laptops are broken and you have to buy new ones for your team? It’s easy to live “today”, when the money in the bank, it is also exciting to scale fast — know your limits and play accordingly.Yes, to play poker, you have to be good in math and calculate chances. Of course, there is still luck (which can be managed, as I described above). There is also something, called “reading people”, meaning, that you can follow and track a behaviour of your opponents in the game. Finding certain patterns in their gestures and attitude helps you to identify, how this person plays, bluffs, raises etc.I do believe, that people around influence you, so do people involve in your startup: investors, employees, clients, mentors. It might sound naive, but I prefer to work with good people and have a strict “No assholes” policy. “Reading” people helps you to see certain signals showing, how good this person is in real life.It also helps to understand, whether someone is bluffing and have “cards on hands” to make a decision and understand, what needs to be done. Is this client trying to simply get a discount to show it off to a boss? Or the client will leave, if you don’t give 15% off?“Reading” people is hard. Understanding them — even harder.Poker was a “game of luck” for me. I was fed up by success stories and photos of pro-players winning millions and flashing money. Shiny cars, stacks of dollars, the huge golden-ish Winner’s belt — all it makes you believe, that it’s easy to get. All you need is luck.In fact, it’s a lie. Practice, strategy, math — this is what helps you to get your minute of fame and millions of cash.It is one more similarity between poker and startups. We see “overnight” success stories and skip, what it actually takes to succeed. As well as we forget, that 9/10 of startups failing at their path becoming the next unicorn. Running a startup is a hard job, and success doesn’t come over one night.Entrepreneur, marketing specialist, CEO  Founder of 

I think that events like Startup Weekend give new founders the idea that entrepreneurship is a little like a RedBull Flugtag — hustle-hustle-hustle and then soar.It’s been a year since we launched Fittr and now, as our company is mid-pivot (one might say straddling) I’ve had a chance to reflect on a few things.I probably have some other advice too, but I have to get back to work.

So, for your 2-minute pitch, start with the 30-second pitch and then add the following points, ideally covering each in a single sentence:What are you bringing to the table that your competition isn’t? What is your “secret sauce”?Whatever you call it, this is the part where you want to tell the investor something you know about your industry and business that they don’t know. Their ideal expression should be kind of an ah-ha face. This one can be two sentences.Seibel said that founders can be weird about this point, especially if the answer is advertising. But it’s best not to beat around the bush or sugarcoat it because then it just seems like you have no idea how you’re going to make money.He said don’t run away from this sentence. Speak simply and directly about how you plan to make money and then move on.To investors, the best achievements of the people on your team are going to be the ones that made investors money, seeing as they’re also investors who want to make money. Even if you don’t have that on your founding team’s résumé, do not resort to listing PhDs.The investor wants to know how many founders you have — Seibel said, preferably between two and four. They also want to know: how many are technical and how many are business-oriented?

Still, after we had our daughter, Violet, all I wanted was to be at home with her. I was the first employee at my company to have a baby, and there was no parental-leave policy. I negotiated for 12 weeks of unpaid leave. By the time I had a handle on breastfeeding, I had to go back to work. At the office, I pumped in a room with a window, obscuring myself, only partially, with an exercise ball. My husband was in graduate school and had a flexible schedule, so he was our daughter Violet’s primary caregiver. I’d dreamed of spending summers with my children as my mom had; in reality, I left my daughter early in the morning and raced home each night for a single feeding with her.As Violet became a toddler, though, I had a change of heart. I felt myself becoming more ambitious at work. I had taken a new job at the University of Virginia’s Development Office, coming up with strategies for thanking big donors. Every day I communicated with donors whose generosity made my own husband’s education possible; suddenly, I felt connected to my employer’s mission. I wanted to advance my own education so that I could take a leadership role at work in the future. And I wanted to do it soon, before I was tempted to have another baby. When Violet was one, we enrolled her in full-time daycare. When she was two, I quit my job. But instead of spending free time with Violet, as my younger self might have wished, I enrolled in an MBA program. Weekends were tough: my husband bonded with my daughter while I pored over net-present-value calculations at the library.When I wasn’t able to get pregnant again, the tension between my personal and work lives intensified. After switching doctors, trying acupuncture, and debating whether to seek treatment, I eventually resorted to the fertility clinic. It was a painful time, but the demands of work persisted. On the one hand, Google had great health care coverage and a flexible schedule, which I took advantage of to juggle regular doctor appointments. On the other hand, I feared I’d never realize my dream of having more children, and I worried the dream had come at the cost of my career. I started a new management position just as I began treatment. I was beginning to set the direction for my new team when I endured a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and disappeared for three weeks to recover from nearly dying. Over the next four years, I had seven early miscarriages. But only the bathroom stalls at Google and a handful of close friends bore witness to my losses.Eventually, we saw a new specialist who encouraged us to try one final time. At 36, when Violet was nine, I became pregnant with twins. I called on a long-time female mentor from Google, who encouraged me to put my babies’ health first, eat around the clock, and swim before work. With twins, I worried about the increased risk for premature delivery. When my energy declined significantly (as is the norm in late-stage twin pregnancy), I called my mentor. “You’re done,” she said. My manager was kind when I went on leave two weeks early. Work stress no longer felt conducive to ensuring my kids’ safe arrival, and I think he understood that. Luckily, my twins were born full-term and healthy. As I walked the halls of the hospital pushing two bassinets, I was relieved and ecstatic.I pieced together seven months of time off using Google’s five months of paid maternity leave, a month of saved vacation, and another month of unpaid leave. When I returned to work, I felt re-energized. Google’s resources provided a smooth transition. This time, I had the financial stability to afford a nanny. I pumped three times a day, but in a room with a door that locked! I took a new position working within a startup inside Google. Still, work was stressful. When our product failed to get traction in the market, there were signs that the company’s leadership planned to pull the plug on it. In the meantime, I formed a team to create a new offering allowing people who searched for health information to connect with health practitioners in real-time. Nevertheless, I feared that I’d be out of a job soon and on the hunt again to reinvent myself. Despite the fact that many more of my colleagues now had children of their own, having three kids at home made trying times at work more challenging.While raising Violet, going through fertility treatments and miscarriages, and having the twins, I had taken advantage of great benefits at Google, but the truth was I hadn’t always felt fulfilled. I started thinking about leaving and founding my own startup. My husband and I pored over our family’s budget and carefully considered the tenure, benefits, and earnings I planned to walk away from. Our family could manage to forgo my salary for one year. Still, my early financial projections meant that I’d take a below-market salary for years. But we decided that, despite the financial risks, I should take the opportunity to pursue my passion. I dreamt about the flexibility and freedom I’d have outside of a large corporation. What if I could fulfill my dream of making more time for my kids while also accelerating my career?When the twins were not quite two, I said goodbye to my confidantes at Google, many of whom thought I was certifiably insane, to launch my own startup. At an early funding pitch, a well-known female venture capitalist told me over coffee, “You’re going to like being an entrepreneur. You’ll work hard, but you’ll have more control over your life.” She was right. I’m more dedicated than ever to my career. When I’m not at the office, I’m using our beta product and discussing my mission with anyone who will listen. I commute to San Francisco to collaborate with my co-founder and to recruit the most promising employees. I put in the same number of hours at the office, but I no longer feel torn about leaving early to have dinner with my family. And I’m more present in the company of my kids. (I also don’t want to nickel-and-dime my employees for time spent with their families, so we instituted an unlimited vacation policy at Rolltape.) In my darkest moments, I have felt scared, deluded, reckless, and selfish. I have worried about returning to our earlier days of financial insecurity. Paring down our family’s expenses has required discipline, but it has come with benefits too. I no longer take small luxuries for granted. Buying new shoes for my growing children or treating myself to a coffee brings me more pleasure then it did months ago. Every day, my children demonstrate courage as they encounter new experiences and face their fears — a slide, a new school, a potty, a plate of carrots. They remind me how invigorating and meaningful it is to take risks.curls and angstA pop-up conversation about having a job. And kids. At the same time.

The story hit the news now because AV decided to make a public announcement, but One reason more startups are getting funded is that there are more early-stage funds in Austin. It may have been AV’s slowest year for early-stage deals, but A few years ago, It’s very Splitting away from the big fund allows AV Partners to play in the early-stage deals when they want to without the overhead of a more traditional fund. I expect that some of their new early-stage investing will look a lot more like a super angel putting together a syndicate. AV Partners have a powerful network of senior executives and institutional investors that they can bring to the table for a syndicate. I think it’s really interesting that they are moving away from the Austin Ventures name. On the one hand, it’s a very powerful brand that is known all over the world and synonymous with Austin tech. On the other hand, after funding hundreds of entrepreneurs and saying “no” to thousands of them, they have accumulated some baggage they seem eager to unload. The past three years of identity crisis around early-stage deals didn’t help… for most of that time AV was messaging, “We still do early-stage deals!”, even though they were clearly trending away from them and that caused confusion and even some hard feelings.It’s not like the VC’s at AV are going away. They will still be in Austin and will still be investing. They have 50 active companies in their portfolio that still need to be managed. Even though they say they are heading in different directions, they are likely so co-mingled in existing deals that it could take many years to unwind everything.Even the partners who leave AV won’t stop being VC’s — they will most likely be investing under new entities and models. Just like new startups spin out of successful companies, new VC firms spin out of successful firms too. We’ve already seen this happen with Austin Ventures many times — Kevin Lalande left to form Sante Ventures, Ross Cockrell left to form Escalate Capital, Phil Siegel and David Lack left to form Tritium Ventures and Ben Scott, Venu Shamapant and Krishna Srinivasan left to form Live Oak Venture Partners, and further back Bill Wood left to create Silverton Partners. Additionally, AV helped Mike Maples, Jr. create his first fund that was the predecessor to Floodgate.For 30 years, AV was the only game in town. They knew all the top talent and got the best deal flow. The VC’s from outside of Austin knew it, too. If AV passed on a deal, why should they even look at it?Austinpreneur.

Most people would be envious of the career I had right after I finished university. I was an investment banker, working in mergers and acquisitions for one of Canada’s top banks and got recruited to working at a $550 million private equity firm. Life was good and so was the money. Actually, the money was great.It was exactly the job I wanted and it was the exact career path I wanted to follow. I couldn’t be any luckier.I was working on deals that made the news and got to fly on private jets meeting CEOs. Expensive meals on the company dime were a typical perk. I loved finance and I was on track to keep climbing the corporate ladder.While I knew very little about the real world, I did know numbers — well at least how to input them in excel all day. I worked like a dog, but I was okay with it. Being an investment banker, especially at the junior level, essentially means doing grunt work all day — 90 hour work weeks were the norm. Lunch and dinner at the office desk was typical. Getting work on a Friday afternoon for delivery Monday morning was the norm. But I didn’t care. I was learning and getting paid.Entrepreneurship was always something I considered and talked about doing, but I never really thought I’d actually take the plunge. And then I did.The calculated decision to leave the industry I loved was based on three factors:I remember being on an extreme high the first few months in to my start-up — and then an extreme low — as my co-founder quit a few months in. He went to a competitor. I was devastated.That night, I was alone at the office, it was pitch dark outside, and the company had little traction. I thought to myself “what am I doing?”, “I’m not cut out for this”. Fear and emptiness was in my soul. Tears rolled down the side of my face as I stared in to the darkness outside.Here I had left a high paying job, worked tirelessly for a few months on the start-up, and my co-founder quits.He did what was in his best interest, and for him, that was the right thing to do. It is in these darkest days that you find out what you are made of. I spoke to a few trusted advisors and some family members, all of which had told me to never pursue the start-up idea in the first place, and after telling me: I wasn’t sure if I was afraid to tell everyone that I couldn’t get it to work or if I actually knew I could make it work. Either way, I trekked on.Building a start-up from scratch is hard in of itself. Losing your partner and mentor a few months in to the start-up is the perfect storm for failure.After my co-founder had left, I remember waking up in the middle of the night, it was pitch dark, and I was a nervous wreck. I started thinking through business issues and what if scenarios. I wondered how I was going to get things done without his help. I would tell myself that I needed to sleep, but I couldn’t. There was just too much on my plate.I remember looking at myself in the mirror one morning and seeing deep dark circles under my eyes. I knew I wasn’t well, but I just kept on going.Losing a fairly hefty steady corporate income was also an adjustment. I remember being fairly free with how I spent my money and rightfully so, I had the income to back up my habits. But when I was in start-up mode, it was a huge change in behaviour. My free-spending ways were done.I remember my family asking me how things were going and I had to put on a brave face and say “good”. They knew and I knew that things were tough, but it’s just part of the early start-up life. You hustle until you make it.I was always thinking about work and what to do next. I lived and breathed my work. Even keeping conversations and staying in touch with close friends became difficult. My mind was just always preoccupied and I had nothing to offer them but my work struggles.For the first few months, I was cold calling potential customers non-stop. Rejection was the norm and it puts an enormous weight on you. I had gone from an investment banker and private equity investor to a mere cold caller getting hung up on.The biggest lesson learned from my darkest days was that you have to keep focusing on the big picture. You can’t look at the day to day cash flow early on as it will never match your opportunity cost at that time. Businesses take time to build and you need to give it a good 1.5 years before you will see significant traction. Small investments everyday payoff in the long run. You never just hit it big; you do small actions that result in a big action over a period of time.In a start-up, you immediately become the head of sales, something I had no experience in, as is the case with many start-up CEO’s.If I have one piece of advice for entrepreneurs with a financial background, learn how to sell. Talk to salespeople and pick up a few good sales books. You’ll learn things like breakup the sales cycle in to small steps with easy frictionless goals for the buyer, touch base about 5 times with a customer before they are ready to buy, and ask for the sell multiple times to learn their objections.In a weird way, I like it. However, one of the pitfalls that early start-ups have is the CEO does all the minor tasks. Initially, it is something that must be done. However, you need to keep a close eye on the right time to outsource. I look back and my immediate reaction is that I outsourced way too late. Maybe because I was thrifty and wanted to protect all the cash flow or maybe I didn’t know what else to do, but the decision to outsource should always be taken early — as it can always be undone.As your start-up begins to gain traction, you’ll need to hire people. It’s one of the hardest things to do for me. The cost of hiring an employee, training an employee, and then having them quit, and for you to start the cycle all over again, is extremely expensive. It is just too time consuming.It’s a bit counterintuitive. Remember, you can always let them go if it doesn’t work out. But finding good people is a challenge. The only true way to get new and fresh ideas and to improve your processes is to bring in the smartest people you can find and afford for that role. Hiring good people will help you stay ahead of the curve.I love over analyzing things. In investment banking and private equity, you analyze everything and exhaust all the potential pro’s and con’s of an investment or merger. This has been one of my biggest pitfalls in a start-up. It takes me a long time to make a decision, simply because I want to ensure I am making the right decision. I’ve learnt that there is a cost of taking time to make a decision.They key is to make decisions quick, test, fail, and throw more resources in to whatever is gaining traction.I’m now over 5 years in to the company. In 2013, our company, My goal is to make $25 million dollars. That is what I want. While it is a lofty goal, it is not unachievable. If a company can make $2.5 million a year and sell at a 10x valuation multiple, you can get to that number. I believe I can do it.Big goals will keep you hungry, working hard, and pushing you forward. While nobody knows what the future holds, always remember to never be satisfied with the status quo.Rahim Madhavji is the President of KnightsbridgeFX.com, a company that helps Canadians get better exchange rates than the banksinspirational and harrowing tales from and about startups around the world.

Bir İstanbul startup community denemesidir.Merhaba sevgili okur,İşbu yazı aslında bir deneme. Hayır, deneme tipinde bir yazıdan bahsetmiyorum. Birlikte bir şeyler deneyelim istiyorum. O yüzden yazının geri kalanını okurken yapacağın her “comment” ve sonuna ekleyeceğin “response” benim için çok değerli. Zira sen benim cofounder’ımsın. Birlikte bir startup yapacağız. İddialı olduğunun bilincindeyim, ama bence denemeye değer!Yani bir seriyle karşı karşıyasın. Bu yazı daha ilk adım. Senin verdiğin bildirimler aracılığıyla serinin devamını getireceğiz.Periscope her ne kadar yakın zamanda türlü iğrenç olaylarla gündeme geliyor bile olsa; ciddi bir şekilde büyüdüğünü açıklıkla görüyoruz. Yayın yapmanın kolaylığı, izleyiciden alınan anlık geribildirimler ve etkileşim sayesinde sistem herkesi kolaylıkla üretici ya da tüketici yapabiliyor.Birlikte yapmaya kalkışacağımız startup da biraz Periscope’u andırıyor. Periscope’daki temel problemlerden biri: kalitesiz içerik.Şu an Periscope’u açtığımda; karşıma çıkan görüntüler şöyle:Muhtemelen Periscope’u üreten amcaların böyle bir niyetleri yoktu. Fakat ürün AppStore’a düştüğü anda onlara ait değil; Nilüfer, Bahar ve Namık karar veriyor uygulama ile ne yapacağına.Problem/ihtiyaç cümlemizi oluşturmaya başlayabiliriz:Peki çözüm ne olabilir?Yine sıcak bir İstanbul akşamında; klozetin üzerinde zaman geçirip telefonumu kurcalarken “dılink” sesiyle jetonlarımdan birinin düştüğünü farkettim.Jeton şeklinde rezone eden şey tabii ki bir WhatsApp mesajıydı.WhatsApp!Hem canlı, hem de memito ortamı değil. Bir chat penceresinde dünya kadar şey konuşulabilir. Canlı bir ortam anlatılır. Bir kişiyle soru/cevap yapılabilir. Çekici bir konuda sohbet edilebilir. Dünya kadar fırsat…Hem merak ettiğiniz bir kişinin ne yaptığını stalk edemediğiniz ama en son online olduğu dakika için bile açıp baktığınız uygulama değil mi WhatsApp?Peki ya o pencereleri izleyebiliyor olsaydık? Çok fantastik olmaz mıydı?Şöyle sorayım;İşte bütün bu düşünce yolunun ardından geldi aklıma bu çözüm sevgili okur. Aklımdaki ürün aşağı yukarı şöyle bir şey;Uygulama içerisinde iki tip kullanıcı bulunacak; Talker ve Stalker.Talker, uygulamada chat yapabilen kişilere verdiğimiz isim. Sadece davet ile uygulamada talker olunabilecek. Buradaki temel amaç uygulamadaki içerik kalitesini yüksek tutabilmek. Bir talker başka bir talker ile chat yapacak. Chat esnasında attıkları mesajlar, onların chatlerini follow eden kullanıcılara notification olarak gidecek. Yine chat yaparlarken canlı olarak o sıradaki Örnek Kullanıcı: Twitter fenomenleri, gazete yazarları v.b.Stalker ise uygulama içerisindeki chatleri takip eden, canlı geribildirim verebilen kullanıcı tipimiz. Stalker sayısı en önemli KPI’ımız olacak.Örnek Kullanıcı: Sen, ben ve merak içgüdüsüne sahip herkes.Birden fazla talker arasında geçen konuşma pencerelerine verdiğimiz isim. Evet sevgili okur, aklımdaki fikri artık sen de aşağı yukarı biliyorsun. Farkettiysen, ürünün somut hali hakkında hiç bir şey konuşmamaya gayret ettim. Bundan sonraki adımımız, ürünün somut halinin ne olabileceğini belirlemek için Şu ana kadar anlattıklarımda aklına yatmayan ya da çok beğendiğin ve üzerine gitmemiz gerektiğini düşündüğün ne varsa rica ederim üşenmeyip geri bildirim yaz :). Recommend edip ortamlarda paylaşarak da yeni cofounder’lar yaratabiliriz startupımıza. Ya da en azından; neden kötü bir fikir olduğu üzerine tartışabiliriz.Sevgiler!Olayı ciddiye bindirecekler için iletişim :) :Twitter: @aykutbalEmail: aykutb@ outlook .comgecenin sonuna yolcu.Gelecek aklında ilerle.

I have read tons of guides and articles about startup marketing. Some of them had more than 4000 words. It’s not a secret, that I am a lazy person and I really hate long and empty stories. I’d rather get interesting information as fast as possible.That’s the reason why I decided to write simple startup marketing to do list (checklist). Of course my checklist is not finished yet. Everyday I find something new worth of adding. Here is the latest version. Enjoy!Do you have something to add to this list? Feel free to share it with us or co-founder  CMO 

It was the top floor of a building in one of the most luxury neighborhoods in São Paulo. From the meeting room, it was possible to see almost all the city. It was a magnificent view.But in front of me I could only see 6 investors. They were there to evaluate my startup.I needed the money. I needed it so much. I had been working for 18 months without earning one single dollar. My money had finished, the company’s cash was almost zero. And I hadn’t found an investor.That meeting was crucial.And on the other side of the table, there were six guys screening my partner and me up. They were analyzing our idea, our capacity to create a startup.The meeting was over, and I left with a strange feeling inside of me.I had a sensation that it was not making any sense.A couple of weeks passed by and, fortunately, they were not interested.Why fortunately?I started to rethink my life. I started to review what I was pursuing. I started to review my beliefs. I let my intuition guide me through. I faced my fears and I was becoming free of them. I was accessing new information while I was writing my book.And then I started to deconstruct the model.He needs an investment to have cash to settle a good team to build a company. He needs that money to hire good employees and different people doing what they know best.If you decide to go on an endeavor by yourself, without investor’s money, it’s possible that you have to do everything in your company. Play in all positions.So basically I needed the money to hire people.No investor wanted to give me the money while I didn’t have a team and I couldn’t build a team because I didn’t have the money. I was stuck.Then I started to think different and deconstruct the model:But what would be their equity and what would be mine?I had invested a lot of money. They would start without investing anything. It was fair enough that I had a higher percentage, right?But 50% of zero is zero. 100% of zero is zero. 80% of zero is zero.Every entrepreneur knows that valuation is one of the most ridiculous things. There is no parameter that makes real sense. It’s all assumption. And there is always someone taking advantage over the other. And there is always someone complaining.If I kept looking for a formula to share equity, I would not go anywhere.Then I realized that everyone should have the same equity. The company would be horizontal, and everyone would earn the same. Every hour would have the same value. No one would have more stocks than the other.I started to invite the professionals I would like to have on my team. I knew those people before both personally or professionally. I once dreamed of working with them.In the beginning, I thought that everyone would say I was crazy and that it was a utopian model.I called a designer, a developer, a film maker, a nutricionist and a business guy.To my surprise, everyone accepted the model and trusted the justice of creating a horizontal company. They all believed in the idea that it was possible to create a freer model. Each one could choose how to work, where to work from and the amount of hours.Together we started to draw the outlines of this model.We would create only one unique deal to make things fair. Those who dedicated more hours, would earn more than those who dedicated less.More than 30 hours per week: earns salary cap.Between 15 and 30 hours: gets 50% of salary cap.Less than 15 hours: earns 25% of the salary cap.And since then, we started to work in the creation of our content startup sharing info on how to live a simple and balanced life, matching nutrition, fitness, gastronomy, and nature. We are launching it in a few weeks in Brazil.We started to grow our team. In 3 months, we set a team of 18 people. Back end developers, front-end developers, UX/UI designer, branding designer, business guys, social entrepreneur, content curator, nutritionists, chef, physical educator, social media, horticulturist/permaculturist, producer, filmmaker, director, and video editor.When you create a horizontal model, the negotiation may last less than 5 minutes. You present the concept and the business idea and say:“You are going to earn the same as everybody here. You can work for the time you have to devote to this, and you can choose how you want to get involved.”Ready. Enough.You don’t need to think too much, evaluate too much, weighing pros and cons, talking with parents, husband, wife.It’s a simple choice. It’s fair. And everybody wins.With 18 people, our field of possibilities opens absurdly. Then we realized that we could create more than one business.And with this team we are creating four startups at the same time.The speed we have is amazing. We have no bureaucracy. We have the expertise to set up any business.How much would those people cost me? How much money should I raise with investors?We didn’t invest one single dollar in setting up this team. Everyone is donating their own time.Obviously we have many challenges. We are going to learn a lot from our mistakes. We will face problems that we cannot even predict. And they are for sure going to happen. But we are going to adjust and overcome, evolving every day. Never stops, like life is. We need to adjust and adapt every day. There is no end and no middle. Everything is the beginning. Every day is a day to get started.If you get thinking about everything that can go wrong, you do nothing. Perhaps none of this will happen. Or maybe it will. And then when it happens we will find a way to solve. Like everything in life.The basic principle of our organization is trust. If I can’t rely upon those who are with me, if I distrust, none of this make sense.If I can’t trust in humanity, in goodness, common sense, and people’s justice, I prefer to quit living. It’s what I believe, and this is what I live for.What is success? If success is money, so this is not a success case. We haven’t launched the startups yet, and we are not making any money.I’m sharing this because I want to show that anything is possible when there is union, collaboration and no separation. We are all the same. We created an insane model as a society. This idea of “every man for himself” or “one being better than the other”.No. There are thousands of others entrepreneurs in Brazil and around the world, creating different models. And that is the beauty of creation. There is no formula. There is no one single truth. There are only the things that you believe.If you join your friends, people you trust and together you create a fair model where everyone is equal, you can turn your dreams into realityYour dream is probably someone else’s dream. You only need to connect.— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —-This post was originally written in portuguese. If you find any mistakes in the translation, please help me with it.

Here’s a short story. Johnny is in NorCal for a few days and wants to know what the waves are like at Mavericks, one of the most famous beaches in the world, just north of Half Moon Bay. Johnny’s following Bhodi on Instagram who posted some “sick” wave shots but that was a few days ago. “If only there was some app for Mavericks to check the surf conditions” Johnny thought. Then it hit him “Brah, what if all surfers had an app to check conditions of local beaches and hear how the waves are riding, straight from the surfers there.”Johnny drops everything, including his long-board. Teaches himself to code. Builds a prototype of “Waves.” A designer friend joins his venture. They raise an angel round. They hire a few more developers and release social features. Top professional surfers join and promote it. They start pitching for a series A round of venture capital funding to accelerate growth but are finding it hard because the product isn’t going viral like they hoped. It solves a need, just not a big enough one to justify millions of dollars. There are pockets of rabid fans but after another few heartbreaking months, it’s clear that Waves will never be considered a successful investment. Johnny posts a heartfelt blog post, they turn the service off, and return what’s left of the investment.A week later another surfer, Tyler, is in NorCal and wants to know what the waves are like at Mavericks, just north of Half Moon Bay. Same problem, different day.No matter where you are, or who you are, we are all awash with problems to be solved. Surfer problems. Celebrity problems. Food shelter problems. Kansas City problems. Trans-gender problems. Republican problems.These problems are unsolved, and they will remain that way as long as we concede our problem solving ability to startups.With more startups than we can keep track of and more apps than can fit on our phones, maybe it’s time for a deeper look at what we are getting for all of this activity, and more importantly, A few years ago, the phrase “there’s an app for that” became popular.Originally, it was a marketing slogan. But it represented much more; it was an expression of the idea that software could solve all of our problems, and that anything in the world around us could also be found and accessed online.In the universe of technology giants like Google, Facebook, and Apple, that expression is summed up in Marc Andreessen’s now famous line about software…If you live and work in Silicon Valley or within its gravitational pull, “software is eating the world” is a constant mantra. If you’re nowhere near California and don’t work for a technology company, it affects your life too, not because of what happens but precisely because of what Most of the frequently used apps on your phone don’t represent a lone coder working in their spare time. Behind that app icon is a team of developers, designers, growth hackers, angels, and often, venture capitalists. That means your problem better be worth a lot of money to a lot of people. If it’s not, then no, there probably A more realistic refashioning of “is there an app for that” is one that talks in the language of economics, of supply and demand, since with very few exceptions, money (or the lack thereof) is what drives app or software creation. In other words, technology solutions are often spun up and executed not because someone asks “is there an app for that?” but because someone is asking “is there a market for it?”That question in turn raises another: who, exactly, is asking the question? And what threshold of users and dollars have to be met before your problem is worth solving?People tend to solve what they know about, and what affects them on a day-to-day basis.For many of us this means figuring out when to exercise, how to set aside time for friends, and our financial plans for the future. But if you’re an engineer or developer the solutions you create in the form of an app or software ripple much further than the pond that constitutes your daily life.A 22 year old white male living in the San Francisco Bay area with some serious disposable income would have to dig deep to find a need unmet by software. Fresh juice delivery? Of course, these services theoretically could be enjoyed by anyone, but the intersection of various forms of privilege creates a powerful market opportunity, so that is where our solutions gravitate.The hard truth is that the reason we constantly get apps that solve the problems of 22 year old males (for example, a readily available supply of dates without having to do a lot of work) is because that’s whose building them. They seem important and world shattering because that’s what they are, to the people who created them.One way to combat this narrow / privileged set of problems  solutions is to widen the field of people working on software. More diversity in life experience and in problems encountered help us create better, more representative solutions. While teaching the world to code has its applications, if you don’t have the time or even know about the opportunity, then you don’t get to participate in the solving of problems with software. You must concede your solutions to software developers, and that’s troubling with or without a diverse group of coders.There’s no question it’s important that we take Of course it is, and that’s what happens when our solutions are bound to startups bound to venture capitalists bound to limited partners who are wholly disconnected from the original problem. The problems that the transgender community faces shouldn’t need to wait until there is a large enough market. Nor should solving the problems of Latino ESL students in Chicago require a billion dollar opportunity or be left solely to the generosity of non-profits.The jet fuel that keeps the startup ecosystem floating is venture capital, a high risk investment that requires out-sized returns.A solution to an investor looks very different than a solution to the end user. The venture capitalist is looking for a At the same time that investors are looking to ride a unicorn to victory, most of us would be just fine with a horse. Horses look just like a unicorns, except they are missing that billion dollar horn. They are the everyday solutions that make our lives better. Local restaurants that feed us, businesses that serve our needs humbly and honestly, friends and family that help us solve problems, whether they are fundamentally scalable or not.Startups almost always start out as horses, solving someone’s problem. But they usually don’t solve it for everyone (or everyone fast enough), and that’s where it falls apart. Only when value for people Most startups fail not because they fail to solve the users’ problem, but because they fail to solve it in a way that delivers out-sized returns to their investors. While the users matter early on, it’s the investor’s problem that drives the company forward.When a startup fails, everything must go. If you have ever used a service or app that was shutdown, acquired and discontinued, or failed to be supported, then you know whose problem was left unsolved.When a startup ends up in the deadpool, its solution does too. The problem becomes unsolved again. One step forward, one step back. This is hardly the technological advancement we’ve been promised.So, what about those apps mentioned earlier? Are they really capable of being a market unto their own?For a long time it was assumed they could solve every issue, especially through customization and location…but they’re turning out to have ugly side-effects. Apps are expensive and time consuming to create and maintain. iOS users get their problems solved first, then Android users. Windows and other OS users are the untouchables of the platform caste system. Simply by opting into a smaller market opportunity, these users drastically reduce the value of getting their problems solved.On the open and free web, net-neutrality is seen as a fundamental right, but in the free market of mobile platforms, app-neutrality would be an egregious violation.Within our phones these apps act as physical artifacts that need to be installed, and then have to be updated or replaced when they are out of date, which is constantly. Each must be downloaded, installed, permissions granted, and then we get to see if we actually enjoy using it.The web isn’t dying, it’s as useful as it’s ever been. But on our phones it is being replaced by But this isn’t just an ‘apps vs web’ debate, these problems also can’t be solved by the World Wide Web because…Nowhere is this contrast more stark than in the interactions of daily life, in our connection to what’s around us.Aside from the fact that many local problems don’t generate the numbers to justify creating a new app or company, they also don’t automatically require someone to swoop in and fix them with complicated code. Sometimes the need for a solution, especially a local one, is for and by a handful of people. Many problems and solutions are unique, ephemeral, local, and shouldn’t require the time it takes to write 1,000 lines of code, let alone to learn software development in the first place.The pothole on Front St. The long line at Bill’s Bar. Reality is, most Millsmont problems require Millsmont solutions. If you haven’t heard of Millsmont, don’t feel bad, neither have software developers in San Francisco, just 15 miles away.World Wide platforms like Twitter are filled with these sorts of misplaced questions.Mobility and location on our phones are a powerful opportunity, but the apps and software we have now are often too narrow and difficult for a user to shape to their individual needs. The fact that such tropes as “Airbnb for X,” “Tinder for Y” or “Uber for Z” even exist at all serve to re-enforce how inflexible our current solutions are.Wordpress is the biggest workhorse on the internet. A platform simple enough to be used by almost anyone and yet solve 1,000 problems (with the right plugin). It’s no wonder that it powers 23% of the web. But it’s open source, and over a decade old. In its place we’ve been given a model of “one problem — one startup.” If the vast majority of startups fail, than this level of inefficiency should be nauseating to anyone who’s not a venture capitalist, and maybe to the venture capitalist too.There will always be an endless supply of problems in need of a solution. Those on “page one” will find their solutions, but the rest, what you could call ‘long tail problems,’ will largely go unsolved, especially with technology.This long-tail is often beyond the province of startups and venture capitalists because they will never be worth billions of dollars. Many are not even worth $100. They won’t be featured in tech news publications or championed by rock stars or social media gurus. Many of them will never be noticed by anyone outside of the people solving them. But they still matter.At the root of any systemic problem there is not a singular underlying factor, but instead hundreds, sometimes thousands, of unsolved long-tail problems. None of which are attractive to venture capital investors. Systemic problems seem intractable because they are… to a mindset that requires everything to be solved with scale.The ability to code matters, but people also need to be able to solve their own problems without elaborate software development or millions of dollars to confirm that it’s worth solving in the first place.Ironically, one way of dealing with this is actually through software. Instead of creating yet another specialized app and startup, we need more workhorses that enable people to solve the problems they know best. Simple, flexible, and well designed networks/platforms that allow people to ship and start using their own raw and unvarnished solutions, rather than wait for others to deliver a shiny new app or startup to save the day. We need more wordpresses, more open platforms, and more decentralized problem solving.At We are building the local web.Long form essays on the state of the social web, technology, and what’s coming next.

3 lessons learned after successfully raising $800,000My name is We first launched the company in early November 2014, and since it’s inception, our main key differentiator as a coding education company was student engagement. We were always obsessed with one KPI: Course Completion Ratios. In other words, it’s the percentage amount of courses started compared with courses completed. To give you perspective of the global online education problem, the average MOOC has a 3% completion ratio. Normally I’m a routine kind of guy. My daily ritual starts by waking up at 7AM, have breakfast around 7:30, hit the gym at 8, protein shake powered team daily meeting at 10, answer emails until 11:30, urgent customer support until 12:30 (I like to get involved with customers’ pains), lunch at 13:00, back on my desk at 13:30 and spend the rest of my day ping ponging back and forth between the product and growth team.Our fundraising journey involved me moving for 4 months from Porto, Portugal to London. I had prebooked a local gym next to my house, had my nutrition plan all worked out and enough meetings to fill up my first month. As predicted, nothing went according to plan. Most of my meetings got delayed, the gym next to my house closed too early and the healthy food ingredients I originally planned to buy were either too expensive or didn’t exist in the local supermarket. What ended up happening was I started eating crappy food and could never get to the gym on time after my meetings.The CEO’s most important job is undoubtably making sure there is enough money in your business bank account to pay your employees and taxes. When we embarked on our fundraising journey, we’ve accounted that it would take around 4–5 months including finding the right investors, dealing with due-diligence, finding a good lawyer to then finally close the legal work. Well, sh*t happens and our 4–5 months turned into an agonizing 9 months. A lot of “last minute” unexpected stuff shows up at all the wrong moments. You’re going to be rejected at least 10x times than you originally planned, your going to wait for that long awaited email 50x times you originally hoped, due dilligence ALWAYS takes orders of magnitude longer and finally the golden document, the contract, will be iterated at least 30 times until everyone in the table has consensus to every single micro bullet point.I leave you with one final lesson. Make sure you have the right people right beside you, because these are the ones that are going to keep you pushing forward.Ed Tech Founder 

Startup funding is largely driven by The Golden Rule: He who has the gold, makes the rules.Let’s face it, the rules for getting a startup funded at the seed stage aren’t very clear. Note: When I say “seed stage startup,” I’m specifically referring to software/app startups that are either pre-product or early product.Many founders read the daily headlines on TechCrunch announcing that…… and wonder to themselves, “Why can’t I do that?” You can. But probably not how you’d think. If you’re spending your time pitching investors, you’re more than likely wasting energy that could be spent moving your startup forward. If you’re of the mindset that you can’t move your startup forward without first raising capital, this post won’t help you so there is no need to read any further.If you are a founder who is a hacker or a hustler and you want to build a startup without wasting time, continuing reading. I wrote this for you. With that having been said, there are two ways to get your seed stage startup funded:TVR stands for: Team / Vision / Relationship. It is the traditional way seed stage startups get funded in Silicon Valley and it remains difficult and out of reach for most entrepreneurs. The formula is simple: T+V = funding, T+R = funding, or V+R = funding. The bottom line is that you need a combination of any two of relationship, team or vision to get your seed stage startup idea funded the traditional way. Let me restate what I just said a different way.Here is what I mean by each.Last, but in no way least, If you are unable to raise money using the TVR formula described above, don’t feel bad — most can’t. You may bring one aspect of the formula to the table but not the required two or three. If you don’t have at least two, I promise, you are waisting your time and will be eliminated from consideration by the selection bias that has kept seed stage funding un-obtainable for many for decades. The good news is over the past few years a better way has emerged to raise seed stage capital. It’s called traction.Traction is the best option because regardless of your gender, race, location or team pedigree, founding teams that hack and hustle their way towards generating traction have no problem raising several million dollar seed rounds for their startups and usually have their pick of investors.Traction as a means of seed stage fundraising is viable today for two reasons: 1) over the past few years it has become cheaper than ever to create a software startup due to free open-source development frameworks, APIs, on-demand cloud hosting, and inexpensive storage; and 2) because it’s cheaper then ever, more startups are launching — creating more competition to get the attention of end-users. As a result, building a product isn’t the hard part. The hard part is getting customers to love it and spread the word despite a vast array of choices.With the explosion of web and mobile apps, many seed and early stage investors today take a “wait-and-see” approach before deploying capital. They’ve recognized that there is no better predictor of future success, then present success.So if you’re NOT having success raising a seed round for your startup the traditional way or would prefer to focus your energy on building your startup vs pitching it…Serial Entrepreneur, Big Thinker  UI/UX Fanatic Founder of Grow. Don’t pitch. Let your data do the pitching.

At K9 we invest in companies which have a clear/direct revenue model and typically don’t invest in companies that follow the Ubiquity first Revenue Later (URL) revenue model When a startup is just getting started it first needs to build its product/service. Often before that it needs to build the team that will then help to build the product/service. And in order to do that they need to either raise capital to be able to hire a team by paying them real dollars or recruit co-founders who are willing to share the journey based on the equity stake and bootstrap the company.Once a startup has its initial product, or even a minimum viable product, it needs to start iterating on its revenue model the same way that it iterates on its product. I call this For most startups going from no revenue to their first paying customer is a major milestone. At this point you’ve convinced at least one person that you’re doing something that provides them value and therefore they are willing to pay for it. While this is a key milestone it is only the base step of a much longer inductive process. Once you have one customer, you have to then try and find another person who thinks just like the previous one and is willing to become your second customer.Once you have a handful of customers you need to then figure out what’s the pattern that makes the process repeatable. Why did the customers buy your product? How much would they have paid for it? Was price an issue? Would they have bought it more quickly if it was priced lower? Would they have bought it even if it was priced higher? Are your customers happy? Will they continue using your product? Would they refer other people to you or at least serve as a reference?The first meaningful revenue milestone is for a company to get to $1,000 per month in revenue. By this point the company should have built a product that people want and are willing to pay for. But they may not have figured out the sales model just yet. At this point you’ve started to see the tip of the iceberg of product market fit.The next major milestone that a startup should try to hit is to get to $10,000 per month in revenue. The $10K per month in revenue milestone means that you’re well on your way to product market fit and you’re just beginning to figure out what the sales process looks like. At $10K/month, it’s also a meaningful number as now you’re at least covering the cost of 1 full-time person.If you were a one-man-band then heck you may already be cashflow positive and profitable, but that’s rarely the case in most startups.One of my favorite people to work with as a co-investor is Getting to the $100K/month in revenue is a big event in a startup’s life. That’s real money. And it’s real money to cover not just a 1 person team, but maybe a 10 person team! And it means that you definitely have good product market fit. It also means that you’ve figured out how to acquire customers. Congrats. You made it. Right?Not so fast. I refer to the $100K/month level of revenue as theThe danger, however, is that you’re now a company with real revenue. You’re past the stage of potentially an existential crisis. By carefully managing your burn rate and steadily growing revenue, you can now survive — almost forever. But there-in lies the rub. When a company reaches this level, the founders are often tired and want and need a well deserved break.I’ve seen too many company fall victim to the plateau of complacency. It’s easy for the founders to give in to this because they can see a steady but linear increase in the revenue each month. Last month we did $100K, this month we did $105K, next month we did $110K. So it feels like they’re steadily increasing their revenue, keeping the operations running and things are going well. However, they’ve now fallen into the plateau of complacency, because unless they do something radical they won’t be able to get to the next level.My advice to founders when they’re at this stage is to stop looking at the absolute growth in revenue and start looking at the In my example so far, I’ve talked about 10X-ing revenue to get to each milestone from $1K/month to $10K/month to $100K/mo. Since leveling up from the $100K/month level is so difficult, it’s highly unlikely for a startup to go from $100K/month to $1M/month in revenue. Instead the company needs an intermediate goal of getting to $250K/month in revenue or getting to $500K/month in revenue.The stage of getting from $100K/month to $500K/month is probably one of the toughest phases in the life of company. At this point it is not big enough to hire experienced (read expensive) people and turn up it’s burn rate to where it can then crater. You have to find the right mindset of people who may not have direct experience but have the right DNA and the desire to learn, the desire to execute and prove themselves — they themselves want to level up.It is only possible to get to $250K/month or $500K/month in revenue once you absolutely have product market fit nailed. You have developed a clear and repeatable sales process. And you’ve figure out how to make your customers fans by delivering a quality of product or service that is awesome. Additionally, internally your team needs to scale and not fall victim to internal politics and finger pointing. You need to be paying attention to recruiting, technology / product, manufacturing, operations, finance, marketing, sales, customer support and more. Note that the first item on that list for me is recruiting. If you’re going to grow different areas of the company you need to be able to hire scalably, while maintaining the quality of the people you’re hiring.Once you cross the hurdle of $100K/month and start getting to $500K/month in revenue, then growing from there $1M/month in revenue is simpler. As by this point you’ve most likely figured out what works and you probably have a team that’s gelling well. Now you need to just do more of it to get to $1M/month in revenue.If you’re a founding CEO, think about where your company is along this spectrum of revenue milestones and think about what you need to do to get to the next level. And don’t forget to look at the first and second derivative of your revenue growth. Good luck!Entrepreneur turned Investor. Chief Firestarter at 

Everybody will tell you that if you are building a company you should make sure that your market is big enough. Otherwise, even if you dominate the whole market, you might not be making enough money to build a big and successful business.The problem is that it’s almost impossible for a new startup to compete with the big guys and conquer a significant market share of a big market.Luckily, there’s a workaround.In this post I will share my thoughts on how to start with a small market, dominant it and expand your success to a huge market.When you are just starting out, no one knows you, trusts you or believes your promises. If that’s not enough, big markets have big competitors that are well known, have many customers, reputation and reliability.How are you going to position yourself against the big guys?Usually, this will not be enough to fight the natural scepticism of the users. Not enough to make people take the risk and make an effort to try what you have to offer.You’re building a mobile-phone and want to compete with iPhone.You create a cheaper mobile phone with a longer battery life and a bigger screen. But iPhone has millions of apps, it’s branded, trendy, highly publicized and much more.What are the chances to acquire a share of that huge market? Probably very low.You are focusing on a small market of professional athletes, and building a mobile-phone that will be tailored for their needs.You can build a mobile phone with special sensors that are important for athletes. Add an ecosystem of apps allowing to use those sensors in order to share training results with teammates and coaches.iPhone’s market is huge, Apple can’t focus on professional athletes, it needs to build an “one fits all” phone. This is your advantage, since hypothetically you can build a much better product for a very narrow market.Doing this successfully will allow you to dominate that narrow market.So now you have a big market share of a tiny market, since the market is so small dominating it might seem useless and you might be losing money.You need to remember that When Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook, the market for it was very limited- Harvard students. It wouldn’t make any sense for the vast majority of today’s Facebook usersThen Facebook expended to other universities, and the rest is history.Another great example is Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors company. Tesla started out by building luxury electric sport cars. By focusing on great innovation and technology, Tesla dominated the market, and built it’s brand.Later Tesla introduced the S-model, an electric Sedan, and the upcoming X-model was the cross-over. Currently over 70K Tesla vehicles were already sold and the company is growing rapidly.Most of the professional athletes are using your phone and since it’s perfect for their needs they are absolutely loving it. They are talking about your phone and showing it to their friends and family. Their friends might not be professional athletes, but since they occasionally jog in the park they might seriously consider trying it.Now you’ve built a good product, your brand name and your users love the product and tell their friends about it. Your next step will be to create another version of the product for the general public.Now you’re no longer just starting out, you’re selling your product, your company gets bigger and you gain interest from investors and press.Although this is an hypothetical example, I think we can agree that focusing on a small market at the beginning of the way eventually will increase your chances of building a successful company in a big market.When I started That’s why in general we’re following this strategy:The first step was researching our competitors, who are the users they are serving.We divided our research into three parts:We found out that the size of the companies using our competitors varies from small unfounded Of course, a product that serves all of the above audiences can’t fit them all perfectly. So we tried to find out which users slip from the main focus of the big analytics companies.It took hundreds of emails, conversation, surveys and meetings in order to focus on one narrow audience:Here are some of the reasons that made us believe that they are most likely to embrace our product over the existing solutions:After we choose our audience, we asked ourself the following question:What a typical SaaS founder should go through in order to understand what is going on in his startup?And, how long will it take?In order to describe the process I am going to use Mixpanel — a $865,000,000 worth analytics company, which is considered one of the leaders of this market.Since we’re building a product for a narrow market, we can make the above tasks much easier.Finally, we just need the user to copy  paste a few lines of code to his project and that code will send to The dashboards will be automatically filled with 27 metrics such as Life Time Value, MRR, User Churn, User Growth etc.The whole integration process should take the user around Here is an example of our user acquisition dashboard:Acquisition DashboardWe’re using “the power of focusing on small market” in order to create a better product for saas startup founders.Is But, we’re perfectly fine with that at this stage, as I explained in our strategic plan above.This post was heavily inspired by the ideas shared in a book called “What do you think , does our plan make sense to you?

A version of this article originally appeared in A Few years ago when I was consulting for startups, I created something I called “As with previous versions, the framework does not attempt to cover things that I would consider to be more “Product Management” focused (like product roadmap for example). I’m taking a purely marketing point of view here. The Framework also assumes that you have a product in market, you feel fairly confident that you have a good fit between your market and your offering and you are ready to invest in lead generation.

When you’re a student, entrepreneurship seems so attractive : total freedom, listening to no one but yourself, making the important decisions, meeting new awesome people, it looks like the best job ever.But only a few young people actually go for it… Why ? Maybe, because we feel dumb. I don’t mean dumb the wrong way, like stupid. I mean dumb, more like ignorant. We lack professional experience and specific skills. So to compensate our professional ignorance, we apply for great internship in big companies. And we are happy because we have a name on our resume.I used to think exactly like that. But a few months ago, I met a serial entrepreneur who pulled me out of my comfort zone. Here is what I’ve learned, and it wasn’t easy to accept it.I’m a student in a great business school in France and I don’t consider myself ignorant. So when I was on my way to meet the serial entrepeneur, I was pretty confident.He asked me so many things : “Do you know this… and that…”, “Are you aware of this new movement, change…”, “Have you already been to this conference, formation…”. And I was exactly like Jon Snow, I knew nothing…When I replied that it wasn’t my fault, that I haven’t learned those things at school ! He was almost shocked. If you want to be an entrepreneur or anything else actually, you have to learn by yourself and grow up !So now you feel a little stupid because you’ve realized that you don’t know a lot and that’s mostly your fault. But despite this lack of confidence, you have to trust yourself ! Which is pretty paradoxal, I agree.First of all, don’t worry, it’s easy to catch up on your delay when you are motivated. You just have to be more curious and aware of all the articles, newsletters, events that take place around you.Second of all, the first step into this new entrepreneurial world might be hard but the second step is so much easier ! You will learn fast and you will meet new people who will be happy to help you.Don’t be ashamed of your lack of knowledge and ask every question you can think of, otherwise you won’t learn. No one will judge you for wanting to learn !If you dream of something, you can’t blame anyone but yourself for not having the guts to try it.Maybe it’s just something that you think might be good for you, but actually isn’t. In that case, you’ll know and you’ll look for something else. But maybe it’s the thing for you ! So don’t miss the chance.So young and dumb, no. But young and bold, yes !Lorène Vignaud, co-founder of La part du gâteau https://fr.linkedin.com/pub/lorène-vignaud/a4/b2/468Follow La part du gâteau on Facebook 

2 weeks ago I wrote a As I sat down to review it last week, I realised that I listed only 1 woman among the 5 entrepreneurs. And I feel that that is a misrepresentation, on my part. Because there are just so many more here in HK — women who’re actively and significantly contributing to the startup community!So, I thought I should create a list of women who are entrepreneurs, investors or essaying other varied roles in Hong Kong’s startup world. These individuals are building awesome products/teams in sectors as varied as education, events, travel, coworking spaces, accelerators, startup platforms, social analytics and so much more!My disclaimers from the Wow!Wonder what you’d like to tell me about this list so far…Let’s continue, shall we?😊Founder profiles have been sourced from Stock images from Founder 

On Nov 7th, 2013 I walk into the speakers lounge at the Andy worked on growth teams at Facebook, Twitter, Quora and now was at WealthFront.He’s one of the “Original Gangsters” (OG’s) in the growth space — just Even though I’d been following his work for a few years online, we had never met in person.After we got introduced I asked him what he was going to talk about.He shared that he was a bit nervous because he doesn’t really give talks very often, but then he started sharing the overview and his philosophy on growth… I knew he was going to kill it.Then I asked him how he approaches growth at a tactical level?He paused for a moment and then went into a story about how startup growth works very much like financial investing.He said “I look at growth much like I look at the power of compounding interest on an investment. The key is to choose the investments that have the biggest returns possible over time. Then prioritize your capital (startup resources) on the ones that will have the biggest impact over time to the over all portfolio.”“Could you draw me an outline for how you assess each opportunity?” I asked.And that’s when I witnessed one of the most elegant and simplest solutions to helping you decide what you should be working on now, vs. later when it comes to growing your startup.What he sketched out — and his overall philosophy — is that startups don’t have one “hack” (p.s. he doesn’t like that term any more than I do.)…… instead they execute on a number of projects that keep adding to the overall increase in growth which gets compounded each year as you get more traffic.Here’s how I understood it.All things being equal (ex: effort), lets say you have 2 growth projects you could work on.1) Improve your home page conversions, orWhat Andy suggests is rank order them based on which would have the biggest impact to driving more users into the product.So in this scenario, if you have a home page that gets 100 visitors a day converting at 10%, and you worked to improve that to 15%, you would get an additional 5 users per day for the lifetime of the product.If you looked at the social share prompt, lets say only 3 of the people per day that signup will ever share that information on social media, and from that share only 1 new person ends up signing up for the product, the growth is 1 person per day.So which would you work on first?The first one right? Exactly.This is a simplified example but it gives you the gist of what Andy was trying to explain.If you list out ALL the possible ideas for improving your growth, and you stack them based on specific variables of growth it’s easy to rank them to decide which you should do now vs. later.Up until that point most of my initiatives were driven by gut and intuition and in one quick 10 minute conversation with Andy, he showed me a way to not only reduce waste (by building things in the wrong order) but also by empowering my team to do it on their own!In some many ways… it’s actually my strategy for building a company overall.It’s about choosing the RIGHT ideas today and putting others off for later.That’s why I created this framework and call it Growth Stacking.Visually, it makes sense in my mind.Right time, right action, eh? (Yes, I’m Canadian).What I’m going to share below is how I’ve incorporated this missing piece into the way I identify the right projects for a startup and prioritize them for growth.The goal is to build a product that grows on it’s own and increases the degree of growth with each completed project.This is a no brainer. It’s about reviewing all your current sources of traffic and seeing which performs best.The overall philosophy is that you want to identify the right sources of traffic for your customer so that you can build the right product hooks to increase that qualified traffic.Here are the questions I ask founders…If you can answer those questions and back em’ up with data then you’ll start to identify the “pools” of attention you can tap into to get your product noticed.As an example, when we were working on a browser extension for Clarity — so that you can search for experts along side Google results — we discovered that users who loved this feature also used Evernote as a browser extension.So what could we have done?We could’ve marketed ONLY to our customers via Facebook (using Custom Audiences) AND were fans of Evernote to promote that feature and get the most installs.Another They built a custom integration that allowed their Hosts to publish their listings to craigslist because they knew that their customers almost exclusively used craigslist to market their listings in the past.Asking your users those questions will uncover some cool ideas to build product features to can help your product grow.If you’re in the unfortunate position to not have much traffic then there’s still hope… I’m going to walk you though an exercise I use to help companies identify there opportunities of growth.Flows, Events  Actions:This is a fun exercise.What you do is make a list of all the flows in your product (ex: User Signs Up, Customer Pays for Account, etc) and then outline each step in that flow.Once you’ve got that, add some quick thoughts on the ones where you could add some kind of “share” prompt to ask the user to introduce your product to a friend.Example:Here’s a completed list for 2 flows within Your goal is to create a complete audit of flows  event to review with your team. Try and identify as many opportunities to build out your product features for growth.Once you have that, then you can sort them into a few categories.Now that you have an audit of all the traffic sources, flows and events you can start thinking through ways to ask you users to share your product with others.I call these Share Actions.What I’ve discovered is that most actions can be put in one of two buckets.1) Other Peoples NetworksThink about the online communities where your customers spend time — that’s why it’s called Other Peoples Networks (OPN). The goal is to leverage other communities (or networks) to insert your product into it and hopeful have their members see it, and click through to learn more.The Airbnb example above is a great example — anyone seeing a listing on craigslist could click through to Airbnb site and learn more.Another would be how YouTube provided a video embed script (image below) so that their users could embed video on MySpace.. essentially sucking a lot of traffic from MySpace.We used this strategy at Clarity with expert profile widgets.YouTube Embed Script ScreenI would argue that Instagram grew by making it ridiculously easy for you to post your photo (with a filter of course) to your favourite social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, etc) all in one click!Instagram Share ScreenAs an example, About.me built a flow that make it super simple for someone to add their About.me URL to their email signature.About.Me Add Email Signature ScreenAgain, I’m a visual thinker so using this type of descriptor helps me think through the right networks I can leverage to get my users to share our product.2) Shareable MomentsShareable moments are similar to OPN’s but different in their mechanics. The thinking here is there’s some kind of data you can create that would be ideal for a user to share with someone else.One example I love is how when you’re creating a profile on AngelList, they ask for your to add references — all you do is provide a Name  Email, and AngelList sends that person an email asking them to write a reference.After they’re done, it ask them to create an account and walks them through their on boarding flow perpetuating the growth.This strategy is why companies like Freshbooks  Basecamp grow so fast. They have an inherent Shareable Moment created by using the product for it’s core value that they share with others to receive it (Invoicing  Collaborative Projects).If you’re a B2B company, ask yourself if there’s a report you can give a user and then prompt them for a colleagues email to share it directly with them.Using this lens for thinking through the right hooks to get your user to share your product with someone else can have a dramatic impact on growth AND retention of your product.Once you’ve completed your audit of sources of traffic, then sorting them into the various buckets of improvements — then you can start gathering the data and estimates you’ll need to stack them in the right order.The easiest way to do this is to list all your growth projects into a spreadsheet then add the following columns.I would then sort by the opportunities that have the most traffic, biggest opportunity to convert and least amount of effort to implement.Now, as you can probably imagine, there’s definitely other criteria you could use to sort the priorities (i.e. Engagement rate by traffic source.) but these are the fundamental ones.What’s great is once you have this, you can start to see a clear path to repeatable (and scaleable) growth.As Andy taught me a few years ago, it’s not about one silver bullet — it’s about constantly challenging our assumptions for traffic, opportunities for conversions, and prioritizing to have the biggest net impact on growth.If your head feels like it’s going to explode — I’m sorry. This was a big topic to cover but I would love to hear from you in the comments below. Let me know what your biggest takeaway was? What are you going to implement to get growing?

When you pick up a product off of a retail shelf, the beautiful packaging might lure you into the brand, or sell you on the great features that are going to make your life more convenient. But it doesn’t really tell you the story of the development process or about the people who built it, and the art of their craft. The development cycle for a hardware product is arduous, but it’s also the most rewarding.Now that the Spend more time in this phase and you will spend less (time) in China. We started with the experience that we wanted people to have and then worked our way backwards to build the technology. We had already narrowed in on the basic feature set, the high-level architecture of the hardware, and the use cases for the product. A lot of this heavy lifting had been done before we launched our crowdfunding campaign.In the early prototyping and discovery phase, we were in the mind set to just build shit. We had 2 goals — build a A However, having a final appearance model should only be a guideline for your design process. It should never put shackles on your engineering team. Expect your model to grow, change shape, maybe even color and finish once you get to mass manufacturing. It’s easy to create a sexy 3D model in CAD, but you’ll quickly realize how many factors will limit you from replicating that in your final design of the product.A As the electrical design evolves, the mechanical fit will inevitably require some rapid changes. 3D printing can be helpful to model these quick mechanical changes. Working with a company like Early on in the process, we hacked away at every aspect of the product, trying to improve the functionality every week — the goal was to build proof of concepts for mechanical pieces, electrical pieces, firmware, and the app. The prototyping at this stage was done independently for each of these pieces. It is really hard to iterate on the overall final product, so we segmented everything and worked in parallel — If you’re a product-oriented person, like us, it’s easy to just jump into the development process and start building things. But it’s also important to take a step back and understand Before Kickstarter, we talked with a variety of people — those who used competitive products to those we thought might be potential customers. Additionally, through our Kickstarter backers, we already had an established community that was willing to learn more about our product — we used our crowdfunding backers to dig even deeper: Don’t just talk to friends and people you know. You need to talk with people who know nothing about you or your product. The best path is to allocate $500 to talk with 10 people (people will flock for a free lunch). Place ads on Craigslist and get a small group together for usability testing over a weekend. You will learn more about your own product in those 2 days than you ever will developing in a vacuum. Test early and test often.Some other testing we did early on:We now had a vision for what the product would look like, and the actual physical constraints for what the mechanical and electrical assembly would require. We just had to jam the massive At this stage spend some time carefully planning out your expected expenses. Manufacturing costs adds up quickly and if not managed properly, can be devastating for a young hardware startup. Don’t expect tooling and labor to be your only costs — plan for testing rigs, equipment, tools, components, computers and other miscellaneous manufacturing expenses.We arguably spent the most amount of time figuring out our manufacturing processes. Everything we learned and accomplished in Phase I, was put to the test. This is where the rubber meets the road.Unfortunately, most prototypes are not designed for mass manufacturing from the very beginning. If your goal with the prototyping phase was to work with customers and engineers to figure out the minimum set of experience and features; your goal now with manufacturing is to work with your contract manufacturer, vendors and suppliers to see what is actually, physically possible.Inevitably, some of the design decisions you made early on in the prototyping stage will not be feasible at a larger scale. As much as it might hurt your soul, you will have to make some compromises on the final look and finish of your product. Molding a plastic part is a science, but it’s also an imperfect process.3D printed parts will only get you so far. The earlier you can start testing with Stick with a Don’t be fooled by what’s available on Digikey and Mouser. Once you move into mass manufacturing, the lead-times for components start creeping up into the 16–20 weeks range. The most important resource for a startup is time, and a 4 month gap in procuring components is something that a young hardware company just cannot afford. It’s imperative to start the component procurement process early, which makes locking down the electrical design even more crucial. If done at the right time, the design can be adjusted to accommodate for supply chain issues. Find the cheapest parts, with the shortest lead-time, that are available through multiple suppliers.Working with a firm like Here are some other decisions that we made during manufacturing, that we wouldLike we said before, test early and test often. Every hardware company will (or should) have their own internal benchmarks for safety and performance. But if you want to sell your product through any meaningful channels, obtaining safety certifications through a reputable third-party is very important. If you’re developing a wireless product, obtaining FCC/CE certifications is mandatory.Certifications are tricky since only finalIt’s never too early to plan for your testing and QA. This is your most important process in manufacturing, make sure it is thorough and controlled. While in development, always be thinking about how to test each part of your product (hardware, firmware, mechanical, software). If unprepared, these will cause either big delays, or poor production quality.Hardware companies don’t often talk about (and often don’t pay enough attention) to the development of their mobile apps. The app is often viewed as an appendage to the product. We consider the app experience to be the most important aspect of a successful app-enabled hardware product. The primary way for a consumer to interact with the product (and our brand) is through the app. In our case, the hardware is meant to essentially blend in with the home and disappear.At the time, the app landscape for the connected home was filled with cluttered interfaces, and overly complex experiences. It was easy for us to figure out what we We can’t stress enough the importance of whiteboards and printed flows/wireframes. This was integral in getting the team to brainstorm and solve problems together.Here are some things that we found to be vital in our design process:How does an artist know when the painting is finished? This is arguably the hardest part of the process. It’s very important to draw a line in the sand that prohibits any further tweaking and prevents feature creep. For now, we will ship v1.0 of the Zuli Smartplug, but we view this as just the starting line. We have learned a lot along the way and cannot wait to use that knowledge to continue to improve the product experience and our skills.There is no better feeling, nothing more satisfying than creating a physical embodiment of your ideas. Building a physical product and going through the development process of a hardware product is expensive, time consuming, and painfully challenging.

Getting your first 1000 customers is no different than getting your first 5,000 or 1,000,000 customers.It all comes down to a few key strategies.Step one to getting your first 1000 customers is to create a product/service that delivers on a promise (i.e. solves a pain) your customers have.…and also gratifies (i.e. they experience the core value) your customers when they sign up or experience it.Think about the first time you had ever been to a Starbucks — just the interaction and the experience.There was like this “aha moment” where you walked away and were like “That was amazing… I’ve never experienced that before… they asked me for my name… the coffee came out tasting really great… it just felt like it was really thought out, deliberate and well developed.”That’s the part that a lot of people don’t have (a great experience) — that if they could get right — would really make everything else work.In the software world they call it “Customer Success”… but you can use the same in your business.Getting your product/service to a point where it delivers on the promise that you display on your homepage and gratifies your customers (or gets them to this aha moment) is number one.I call it the Some people think they have a marketing problem — and I’m going to tell you right off the bat that 99% of the time it’s a product problem.They don’t have a product that solves a problem, or the promise they make isn’t delivered on.I like the word It’s a great way to think about your marketing (ie. your demand marketing or inbound marketing) because essentially you’re building it to get new customers.The way to build your engine is by testing different marketing channels.You know you have an engine of growth when you know time (or money) added to the engine will result in “X” number of new profitable customers.A challenge that most startups have is they don’t realize that when they do a bunch of “viral” marketing they could get a bunch of people who sign up and never use the product.This happens all the time with PR. They think, “Well, if I get covered on TechCrunch (because that’s the holy grail of anything!), then my startup is going to be successful.”That couldn’t be further from the truth.There will be this big spike in new signups because a bunch of people signed up to register to confirm their username — but that’s the only reason they signed up.They have no interest in the product. They think, “Someday if this takes off, I’ve got to make sure I have my username!” And they never come back, they never use it, and they skew all of your metrics.They make you feel great the day or the week, then you just feel like “Wow, that spiked, and now it’s flat again.”It’s not sustainable. That’s why for me, it’s about building an engine and it’s about figuring out the Once you have a product that really delights — and you have a concept of building habits that get new customers — it’s about doing LESS.A lot of startups create a bunch of stuff. They think, “I’ve got to do Facebook marketing, I’ve got to do content marketing, I’ve got to do PR, I’ve got to be speaking at events. I need to do all of this stuff.”Most of the time — when nothing works, and you’re not seeing results — it’s because you are doing too many things and you don’t know which one of those things is the reason it’s working.If you do less, then you’ll KNOW what’s working, or not.Think about this concept… most companies die from indigestion — not starvation.They die because they do too many things and they don’t focus.When you do too many things, you don’t know what’s not working.If you want to get your first 1,000 customers (or your first 5,000 or 1,000,000 customers) you want to make sure you have a To me, at the end of the day, the definition of a startup is learning as fast as possible.And if you have competitors out there, remember: “He who learns the fastest wins.”What are some strategies you’ve used to get your first 1000 customers?

If you follow the stock market, some interesting stock price dynamics might have caught your eye recently. Specifically, after second quarter earnings were posted, three companies experienced somewhat unexpected results: Amazon and Google stocks hit all-time highs, while Apple’s fell by a smaller margin.At first glance, those shifts don’t make much sense.After all, Amazon’s forward P/E is 450, Google’s is 29, and Apple’s is 14. For context, Ultimately, there are numerous metrics and financial figures that factor into stock price, but the very high-level justification for Amazon and Google’s gains — and Apple’s fall — is fairly simple: It might take years to find out if investors’ bet on Amazon is an intelligent one, but one thing is clear: The ways in which a public market growth investor values a business isn’t much different than how a growth investor in the private markets (angels, VCs, private equity funds, etc.) project value on startups. Like public investors, we leverage a variety of data points to make educated bets on the future.This helps explain how a consumer startup like Snapchat While it might sound absurd to celebrate the fact that the business generated just $92 million in profit in Q2 on $23.19 billion in revenue, those numbers are somewhat irrelevant to investors betting on the future value of the company. What is relevant is the very real possibility that Amazon could eventually become the world’s biggest retailer, grocer, cloud computing provider, etc. The same can’t be said of Wal-Mart, At the end of the day, valuations — whether they’re public or private — are an educated guessing game. As investors, we buy and sell based on the likelihood that a company will grow into a very big, very powerful enterprise.Now, that’s not to say we’re always right (in fact, investors often fail more than they succeed). And it’s not to say your company’s current That might mean rapidly acquiring users with the promise of monetization and profitability in the future, or it might mean optimizing your margins and financial health today so that it becomes difficult for other companies to compete as you grow. Regardless of the approach that makes the most sense for your type of business, the idea should be to build with one eye toward real performance today (acquiring more of your Do that and you’ll stand a better chance of becoming your market’s Amazon — a business with such massive future potential that investors are happy to pay a huge price today for the promise of even bigger returns down the line.Founder of 

This However, out of 100 entrepreneurs, 99 will probably tell you otherwise, and the last one is obviously deluded.So, We did a random survey of 50 entrepreneurs, and received a very diverse set of problems faced by them at the seed and growth stage respectively. This makes sense on hindsight, as we made sure to survey across a variety of markets and industries.There were, however, three key problems at each phase that most startup founders seemed to encounter.For all the attention that startup founders get, the quality of work done — especially in the early stages — is largely determined by the team behind them. Not only do these first employees have to be talented enough to churn out top-notch work, more often than not they also need to juggle more than one task at a time.Because of this, Jefrey Ong, founder of Malaysia-based roaming service provider Naturally, this applies all the more when finding co-founders. Towards that end, Toby Ruckert of The perpetual challenge for all startup founders is, “how do I get customers to use my product or service?” Unless you’re fresh out of a prestigious program like This task is all the more harder for marketplace startups like The Lorry, who suffer from the “chicken and egg” problem. Vendors or suppliers want to see customers before joining the platform, while customers require proof that the vendors on the other end are reliable.In short, a tough nut to crack.Getting that first ten customers, according to Edwin Tay, who heads education startup There is a startling number of startups out in the world today. Fast Company This is particularly pertinent at the seed stage, when your startup is struggling to catch its first breath on little to no resources. “How do you do more in short period of time without the big bank account and team around you?” questions Ching Wei Lee, co-founder of Here’s where the much talked about “agile mindset” comes in — fail fast, learn quickly, and keep improving till you beat out the competition. In this way, entrepreneurs can build a minimum viable product and reach the market quickly, receiving valuable input and (hopefully) validation, says Tham Keng Yew, the brains behind business-matching platform By executing fast, founders will have a clearer idea of how to develop an idea into a full-fledged company, adds Krystal Choo, founder of travel app Startups might not necessarily have the means to hire the required talent to get all these done in the early days, which is where companies like Now that product-market fit has been established, startups need to focus on empowering specialized roles to drive certain metrics. For these positions, only the best-in-class talents will do, but every other founder surveyed in this study said that it is far easier said than done.Choo and Ruckert — from Wander and Unified Inbox respectively — both agree that it is a massive challenge to keep employees motivated through the ups and downs. And the nature of startups is such that there are Choo says that morale is particularly difficult to maintain, since most employees are now being paid with salaries instead of full-on equity — they have to be motivated differently.For this to happen, LawCanvas’ Leong thinks that establishing a team culture — and preserving it — is critical. More importantly, everyone has to be constantly kept “on the same page on what we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and what needs to be done next and by when.”In the same vein, most entrepreneurs found that as the startup scaled, they no longer had the capacity to look after everything. In Ching’s words, the workload now requires an “initial set of top calibre guys who are willing to go ‘all in’ with you.”In other words, there is a need for an all-star management team to take the reins at the growth stage — people you can trust to “make very big decisions with very little data and in a very short time,” according to Doing this isn’t as simple as just throwing money at talented individuals. EasyUni’s Tay recounts this particular period as “horrible” because there wasn’t a strong foundation to begin with. Their team comprised of 15 fresh graduates at that time. Taking too many shortcuts at the seed stage, he says, caused many problems when scaling up and moving to the next level.It’s not enough to have a group of brilliant individuals. In order for a company’s products or services to remain excellent, good processes must be established — notably when company size is swelling in numbers.Or, as Goh from The Lorry puts it, it is “essential to have a standardized service commitment to the customers in order to be scalable.”A good management team and processes go hand-in-hand. Once procedures have been defined, Wedding.com.my’s Leow says that the founder has to let his lieutenants handle them, “trusting they will follow or do better, so that you can move on to bigger things.”And there we have it.

Als ich im Juni 2007 in Cannes war, schien noch alles in Butter: Die Branche feierte sich selbst, die Budgets waren groß genug für tolle Kampagnen.Das Internet war zwar da, aber irgendwie noch nicht so wichtig, dass man Angst haben musste, dass es alles veränderte. In 2007 schrieb ich Strategien für Second Life und ich wurde gefragt, was man denn mit diesen Blogs machen solle. Facebook war noch verhältnismäßig klein, Twitter gerade mal ein Jahr alt und irgendwie waren sowieso alle bei StudiVZ.Acht Jahre später feiert sich die Branche immer noch Jahr für Jahr an der Croisette, aber ein paar Dinge haben sich geändert. Google und Facebook teilen den Online-Werbemarkt unter sich auf, Kommunikation findet dezentral auf dutzenden Kanälen gleichzeitig statt.Ich arbeite seit fast 10 Jahren für Kommunikations-, Werbe- und Digitalagenturen. Mal fest, sehr lange frei und zwischendurch habe ich selbst eine kleine Agentur gegründet.Vor drei Jahren habe ich ein Startup gegründet und bin damit Aber schauen wir uns das ganze Dilemma mal näher an.Langfristig überleben daher nur zwei Arten:Schauen wir uns nun die andere Seite an: Die Welt, in der Milch und Honig fließen.Nicht ganz. Denn Startups haben ein großes Problem:Auch nicht, denn es gibt ein Geschäftsmodell, das bisher kaum betrachtet wurde.Hier kommt die These: Wenn Agenturen und Startups zusammenarbeiten kann daraus ein neue Form von Unternehmen entstehen, sozusagen das beste aus zwei Welten.Warum kann das funktionieren?Viele Startup-Gründer waren vorher in Agenturen: Noah Brier vom erfolgreichen Marketing-Startup Agenturen sind abhängig von wenigen Kunden und sind gleichzeitig gefangen in einem Geschäftsmodell, das nicht skalierbar ist. Startups auf der anderen Seite sind abhängig von externem Kapital, um ihre Innovation und ihr hochskalierbares Geschäftsmodell realisieren zu können.Dieses Vorgehen ist sicher nicht trivial, denn es müssen zwei völlig unterschiedliche Business Cases realisiert werden: der eine sehr kurzfristig und direkt, der andere langfristig und indirekt. Zudem muss das Dienstleitunsgeschäft so gut laufen, dass genug Geld für Reinvestitionen übrig bleibt. Die Gewinnausschüttung muss in so einem Fall natürlich warten.Wer große Unternehmen berät, weiß wie sie ticken und was sie brauchen. Das ist der große Vorteil von Agenturen. Eine Startup-Agency tut gut daran, sich auf die Entwicklung spezialisierter Software und Services für Enterprise-Kunden zu fokussieren. Consumer-Products machen wenig Sinn, denn kein Agenturmanager von Mitte 50 wird das neue Snapchat erfinden. Die meisten wissen ja nicht mal, was Snapchat ist.Enterprise-Software funktioniert aus einem einfachen Grund: Wer die Probleme seiner Kunden kennt, hat den sogenannten “Unfair Advantage”, in diesem Fall einen Branchen-Insight, der dem Rest unbekannt ist. Das macht sowohl die Entwicklung als auch den Verkauf von Software as a Service (SaaS) leichter.Neben eigener Produktentwicklung können Wissen und Fähigkeiten natürlich auch genutzt werden, um digitale Produkte für die Kunden zu entwickeln. Nike+ zum Beispiel ist das Ergebnis so eines Prozesses: Gemeinsam mit RGA hat der Sportartikelhersteller einen Service konzipiert, gebaut und kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt, der heute eine der tragenden Säulen in der Digitaliserungsstrategie von Nike darstellt. Mit dem bestehenden Kunden in die Produktentwicklung zu gehen, erzeugt Vorteile auf beiden Seiten: Das Unternehmen profitiert von der Expertise der Agentur und kann neue Geschäftsfelder entwickeln und erschließen. Die Agentur wird Teil des Entwicklungsteams und kann ihre Arbeit in Rechnung stellen.Wie oben erwähnt, überleben langfristig nur zwei Arten von Unternehmen: Die großen Full-Service-Anbieter und die Spezialisten. Dazwischen ist nur Platz für Mittelmaß.Und da ein Unternehmen selten von Anfang an sehr groß startet, ist die Lösung auch für Startup-Agencies Spezialisierung. Dazu gibt es zwei Arten:Jede Form von Expertentum hilft bei der Differenzierung, schränkt aber natürlich ein und kann bei Wachstum in weitere Felder hinderlich sein.Im Silicon Valley ist das Gejammer groß, weil gute Entwickler Mangelware sind und Designer, die ein digitales Produkt gestalten können, noch seltener anzutreffen sind.In Hamburg liegen diese Leute auch nicht unbedingt gelangweilt auf Galao-Strich am Schulterblatt herum. Aber es gibt sie, sie sind bezahlbar, sie vergeuden nur oft ihre Zeit mit Arbeit, die sie eigentlich nicht so richtig interessiert.Technologie-getriebene Agenturen haben im besten Fall alle Leute, die auch ein Startup braucht, nämlich:Ich weiß aus eigener Erfahrung, was passiert, wenn man diese unglaublich talentierten Leute in einen Raum setzt und sie an etwas arbeiten lässt, das ihnen Spaß macht.Das hört sich erstmal alles ganz schön an, was ich da geschrieben habe. Aber die größte Herausforderung ist es, eine eigene Kultur und Denkweise zu etablieren. Wenn man neue Produkte entwickelt, ändern sich Rahmenbedingungen:Diese Unternehmenskultur ist essentiell für das Gelingen eines neuen Unternehmensmodells — andernfalls bleibt alles oben geschriebene reine Theorie.Ja, Agenturen haben ein Problem. Ihr klassisches, Tagessatz-basiertes Geschäftsmodell kommt an seine Grenzen, Kundenbeziehungen erzeugen viele Abhängigkeiten, ihr Grundkonzept ist über 50 Jahre alt. Aber sie haben auch einige der besten Leute, starke Kontakte und viel Erfahrung. Es wird also höchste Zeit, dieses Potenzial zu nutzen und eine neue Art von Unternehmen zu schaffen.Ein Unternehmen, das im Jahr 2015 angekommen ist, das Technologie nicht nur nutzt, sondern weiterentwickelt, das Komplexität annimmt und starke Lösungen und Produkte erzeugt.Creative Director at Startups  Stories aus Hamburg

In recent times, investing in hardware startups used to be a no go for VCs and angels. Their challenges are well known: they are intensive in capital, complex to run operationally, have lower margins than software, etc. And even if they succeed, hardware tends to be commoditized over the long run which breaks its defensibility.But then, And now, drones are one of the hottest niche segments for startup investment — putting it into perspective, drone startups raised Drones are attractive today because, basically, they can fly longer and better and are cheaper.And they do that, not surprisingly, mostly because of the progress in technology.On one side, the electric motors and processors are a lot more efficient in terms of energy consumption. On the other side, batteries generate more power per kilo which allows the drones to fly longer. Those processors are also a lot more powerful which allows engineers to do real-time computing to control the flight to make it more stable and easier to control. Additionally, the elements to build a drone are also cheaper and more available thanks to 3D printing and other prototyping tools.That progress in technology means that today, for a couple of hundred $$ we have commercial (or even But technology only explains part of the changes. In addition to technology, these factors are also helping to increase adoption:Drones are still in their infancy. Therefore, like the computer industry 40 years ago, most of the money is still being invested into the hardware companies that are manufacturing the devices.But even at this early stage, we start to see the emergence of different areas of development:In terms of drone startups, the most relevant players are — so far, because the industry changes very fastThe military space requires heavy efforts in RD. So far only In the commercial sector, the industries where drones are starting to be used are those where large areas need to be monitored or the access by humans might be complicated — infrastructure, construction, mining, agriculture and oil  gas among other examples. There, we see players who are horizontally focused like ABut where larger amounts of drones are being sold is in the personal space. More than 2 million drones are been sold to recreational users per year — In the software arena, the amounts of funding deployed are significantly smaller. The two most relevant players are Being in such an early stage as an investment area, most VCs have done none or a single investment in drone companies.Some of the ones who did early stage bets are In later stages you can find the usual suspects — The highlight of our last off-site was playing We have been looking at several opportunities on that space. So far, we have done one investment in a drone company -still not announced- and we’re looking at other opportunities.As a macro trend, we think that drones have great potential to make industries more efficient in several ways — they can work autonomously, they can access places where humans can’t or don’t want to go, they are very precise, etc. As a micro approach, we are focusing on opportunities where most of the value is created through software — you know, we love SaaS and marketplaces.Horizontal platforms helping drones to get into more use cases, or vertically focused ones that help specific industries become more efficient through data collection or monitoring, operating and security systems, etc. All of those are areas where we think great companies can be built and we would like to be part of that.Investor in Startups Stories from the Point9 team  portfolio companies

As a child I used to go to the local video store to rent movies to watch on the weekend. The store, part of the Potomac Video chain, was one of the last video stores in Washington, D.C. But after 33 years, the business suddenly Regardless of your past business model, if the market has changed, your business needs to change, too. Potomac Video didn’t latch onto the trend of streaming movies online or shipping videos straight to customers’ doors. It stuck with its old business plan, simply renting and selling videos from a store.For that matter, remember how you used to love to stop by Blockbuster? You know, the place you’d stop by on the way home to pick up that new release on VHS? (Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010; yet even after Dish Network acquired its debt, Dish decided to close all retail stores, Did you know that in 2000 An entrepreneur who wants to experience continued success in business must stay on top of his or her industry and predict the future. Entrepreneurs Giovanni Mannella and Misha Mitsnefes have done just that with their startup Mitsnefes owns a music blog, Although other music blogs recommend songs, the Bmpur website enables anyone to recommend and “repost” music he or she is interested in, “Post anything from YouTube, Soundcloud, blog links, Instagram links, etc. Then the community interacts by “bumping” posts, commenting, favoriting (like repost/retweet), and sharing the link!”Mannella and Mitsnefes are taking a gamble with their new approach. They realize that Bmpur won’t last without innovation.If you’re looking to change up your business model to make your startup last, use these three approaches:Innovating with a startup doesn’t mean just changing the name of a business or overall brand. Instead use the leverage of an existing brand to draw attention to its evolution and innovation. Bmpur built excitement for its platform through its social media channels. Consider making ambiguous announcements to keep people on their feet.The best way to see if a business will grow as a result of innovation is to see what others think. Before a new product launch or redesign, show family, friends, acquaintances and even die-hard customers. The team at BmpurThe key to a successful change in a business is ensuring that others know. Connect with other industry leaders to see if they have advice. If you have a blog, connect with other bloggers to see if they want to help promote your business shift. You could end up leading a whole industry swing.Making a startup last is a challenge that every entrepreneur faces. Businesses often see a period of strong growth, hit a peak and then the business begins to dissolve. Ensure your business doesn’t peak by continuing to innovate.If you found this article insightful, please recommend it below :) I originally published it on College Entrepreneur 

Four of the companies I’ve worked for during my career have been acquired for over $1 billion dollars. Make no mistake, my contributions to these successes, particularly early in my career, were relatively minor, and I’ve had my share of failures, too. But I’ve been fortunate to learn important lessons from each experience. Here is the most important career strategy lesson I have learned:Many job searchers target companies that seem “hot”. But the best jobs – the ones with the most upside – are the jobs that are available in companies A people-focused job search starts with your personal network (especially your weaker connections) and moves one degree past them for leads. Invest 95% of your time here. The remaining 5% can be allocated to recruiters and job boards, but the investment you make in your personal network will be amplified and produce far superior results.Seek trusted referrals to senior leaders – people with hiring authority – and talk them into creating a custom role just for you. A firm’s hiring plan will describe commodity roles for commodity candidates. Ignore it. Never think of yourself as a commodity. Your uniqueness makes you a scarce resource. Scarcity increases demand. Conveying the confidence derived from this mindset is more than half the battle in selling yourself into a position where none previously existed.For more senior positions, each meeting is a big swing at bat. Don’t use a shotgun approach. Be prepared. It’s worth it. Emphasize quality over quantity. Think of each meeting as an investment in what will become a lifelong, enduring relationship. Invest a day (or more) creating a custom-tailored pitch on how you will solve an important problem for the person you are meeting in a way that is linked to your unique talents. If necessary, consider offering your services for free to begin addressing the problem and proving your value (never work for free unless it’s part of an agreed-upon path to securing your ideal job). And for the right person, don’t be afraid to take a role that seems “beneath” you. As Eric Schmidt famously advised Sheryl Sandberg when she hesitated to accept Google’s job offer (back in 2001, before Google’s remarkable success), Career strategy is important. You want both an Pro tip: lots of people settle for this affiliation. But you want more than mere affiliation – you want attribution. Here’s why following great people leads to that, too:So, avoid the stock job openings and focus instead on finding and working with great people. In the end, the rocket ship that propels your career won’t actually be a particular company or series of companies – it will be the people with whom you work.Co-founder  CEO, Zensight — former Netezza/Endeca/Big Data guy — I build technology to help sales reps sell moreExploring technology, sales, and marketing

Every early stage startup wants to raise funding, especially on good terms. Few weeks ago I was searching for Scala developers (So far, so good.I sent our deck and surprisingly fast I received follow up email that read they have found a We scheduled a skype call and after 90 seconds into my pitch they cut me off and asked “Terms were better than great. No board seat, no equity, not even a convertible note. Just a 5% loan for 5 years. Who wouldn’t agree to that?In two more days we negotiated the term sheet and were officially invited to Dubai to sign the documents. Finally, I thought.But then I also thoughtSo we started to dig into their background and did our own due diligence. What we unraveled was quite amusing.After 30 minutes we found a lot of gaps. Let’s list some of them:Then we became super suspicious and Googled their photos.And we found that those were photos of:After few days we received an email where they asked for money. Our Dubai friends wanted to prepare the documents for my arrival beforehand and asked for upfront payment of $8,250 for underwriting and legal fees.Nice try, but still no.It is absolutely normal (and even recommended) for a startup to investigate potential investors. Investors are very careful in who they invest in. Startups should be just as careful with who they take money from. Startup-investor relationship is just like marriage that goes for 3–5 years. You should be 100% confident in your choice.We follow this practice and check all incoming deals. Luckily we didn’t fall into scammers scheme. But I am pretty sure there are many desperate startups who need funding and are blinded by a prospect of getting $1M for nothing.We have prepared an archive with screenshots, emails and documents in case you encounter them too. I also tried to contact Stephen, Polly, Chris and Rune but they never replied to my emails. Hope they are not very upset somebody using their photos for fraud activities. And I can’t even imagine what is the punishment in UAE for that.Hope you all raise legal money in near future!Please ❤ and share this post so more founders and VCs become aware of such venture fraud.And one more time just to stress it.How we’re building email startup ignoring traditional email canons

January 6th, 2014 I began working as the Marketing Manager for a Venture Capital backed SaaS startup called As the Marketing Manager, I reported directly to our CEO, Chad Halvorson. You may have read about him on Inc. Magazine’s website last year as one of their Chad is quietly fierce. When you talk to him, he comes across as the buddy you play video games with, but don’t let his quiet demeanor fool you — he knows exactly what he wants, down to the pixel. It’s actually a bit Steve Jobs-ish. He’s also one heck of a worker. I’m used to working long hours — in fact, my job prior to this was as a registered nurse (RN), and I was trained in nearly every unit of the University of Minnesota. As an RN there are many times that you work 16 hour shifts, and occassionaly even work 20 hour shifts. Chad outworked me everyday. It was impressive and scary at the same time, but it made us one heck of a team.I love numbers. Like, a lot. I memorized Pi out to 59 digits on my way to work one day simply because it seemed like a really fun idea. A few weeks into working with marketing analytics though — and I hated numbers.We had metrics coming in from dozens of sources, Google Analytics, I learned that our previous LTV calculation was wrong — enough so that it made a pretty big difference. We had no good calculation of CAC breakdown for each of our advertising channels — which made it hard to tell if we should spend more money or less money on each channel. Eventually I managed to create a Marketing Metrics spreadsheet in Google Docs that was based heavily on this After digging into our analytics and their inaccuracies, we decided that if we want to be data driven, we should hire a data analyst full time to create and maintain the necessary KPI dashboards for us, along with having him spelunk through the caverns of data we were accumulating to see if there were other patterns that we might be missing that could help us find the right growth hacks.We found a data champion named Dennis Still. He was able to come in and help us sort through all the data and find the right Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard to help us get the numbers we needed at our fingertips. We tested and used a lot of solutions — but the one that helped us get the best dashboards for high level metrics right off the bat was After I learned the other 900+ tools (I’m exaggerating — a bit) that we used in the marketing department, I was able to settle down and find some big wins for us. I started with the fastest wins — advertising. The allure of PPC on Facebook ads and AdWords are that the return is almost immediate. SEO, Content Marketing, Social Media are all good, necessary and even fun — but they take a while longer to see revenue growth — which is just simply too long to wait for a grown up that hasn’t completely outgrown his ADHD.At the time, we were working with an agency named Hot off the heals of February’s success, we put a new plan into motion for March that allowed us to test out many of the same variables for MAI (Mobile App Installs) along with new custom audiences and look-alike audiences. This again helped us scale by spending more money and decreasing the cost for each MAI (Mobile App Install). As things scaled, we eventually switched to another agency, Growth Pilots, to help us get to the next level with our PPC — and they crushed it!We also did some A/B tests on the homepage of the website that also showed some huge improvements in getting people into the top of our funnel — over 40% increase in signups. I wrote about that Based on the big wins we were seeing from our A/B testing, and based on data that suggested our page load time was slow, we set out to redo the website. When we finished the design files, our CTO, The new website continued to convert at even higher rates than before, which was great — and the site was blazing fast, which helped us in search results. It was a winning combination that allowed us to really push hard and set a few more records in the early summer for customer growth.Chad has always been pretty forward thinking — which is what allowed him to create the app in the first place, not to mention bootstrapping it to $1 Million ARR (Annual Run Rate) before accepting funding. He and I quickly noticed that the trend to be media publishers was not just a fad, but would likely be the key to good lead gen as well as One of the best lead generating things we created was an excel spreadsheet that people could download and use to schedule their employees. While it seemed a bit counterintuitive at first, that a SaaS company specializing in scheduling your employees online would offer a The other big thing we were able to do was push to get our blog traffic over 100,000 visits a month. Having a Content Manager like Rob, that could focus on writing or scheduling posts that people were interested in, along with high quality images from Brandon, and the right promotion from Nicole Ward, our Social Media Manager — allowed us to quickly scale past 100,000 blog visits each month. The inbound marketing team would figure out what type of post we needed and how we would promote it before the piece was even written. I can’t stress the value of promotion enough.Working for a startup let me network with some pretty heavy hitters. I even got to shake When Sujan joined, he taught me the ropes of pretty much EVERYTHING. Everything I thought I had learned in the previous 7 months, he turned it upside down and inside out — showing me 100s of ways to do it better and faster. Since he took over the marketing team, it allowed me to focus in on weak areas. One of those areas was SEO (Search Engine Optimization). I spent 2 months developing an SEO game plan and figuring out the best strategies for us to maximize our link opportunites. I used Moz Pro as my go to tool — and I devoured every article I could find on their blog, He also helped me really grasp CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) by sending me to The rest of the team was every bit as dedicated to growth as we were, and the growth would not have happened without everyone involved. I can only tell the story from a marketing perspective, but there are so many other facets that were crucial to our success.Our Sales/Success team, lead by Our Customer Support team, currently lead by I already mentioned our CTO, Dan Olfelt, but I would say that he is quite possibly one of the smartest people I have ever met. He had a way with managing all of the developers and code in a way that made it seem almost effortless. He could do ANYTHING with code — there was absolutely no limit to what he could accomplish or even how quickly he could get it done. I am forever spoiled now after working with an in-house development team of that quality. All of the programmers made our silly marketing requests a reality which really made many of these big wins as successful as they were.I would be crazy if I didn’t mention our COO and President, There are still people that I’m missing, but the truth is that it took an entire team of highly dedicated individuals to push us to grow as much as we did last year — and it was quite the ride — and education.At first, I didn’t want to. Another company had contacted me about working with them and leading their growth team to success in 2015, but I couldn’t dream of doing anything different. Thankfully I had a great friend and mentor, who also happened to be my boss — Sujan.Sujan told me that I had grown immensely and that if I had the opportunity to lead a team of my own, that he believed I was more than ready. He told me that he was “graduating” me on to a new chapter — a new challenge. That really is the best way to look at it, as a graduation. In fact, we jokingly played But sometimes you have to graduate to get better. You have to move on and challenge yourself with something new — something different, so you can continue to grow.

Cet article résume ma réponse à tous mes amis (et amis d’amis) qui me contactent pour me demander des conseils sur la création et le développement de leur idée de startup.…par contre, je préfère te donner des conseils personnalisés une fois que tu seras sur les bons rails, plutôt que perdre mon temps à répéter une fois de plus le B-A-BA sur la création de startup.Le but de cet article est donc de me faire gagner du temps, en t’aidant à te mettre sur les bons rails, avant qu’on discute plus précisément de ton projet.Créer une startup est devenu à la mode, le nombre croissant de startups en montage a donc deux conséquences pénibles pour les développeurs:Les développeurs sont donc de plus en plus demandés, à la fois par les entreprises et par les créateurs de startups. Or, une différence fondamentale entre ces deux possibilités qui s’offrent au développeur, est que l’entreprise verse un salaire immédiatement (qui plus est généralement conséquent). Donc, en tant que créateur de startup (aux moyens souvent modestes), tu as intérêt à mettre toutes les chances de ton côté avant de demander de l’aide.Sachant que l’aspect quantitatif n’est pas prêt de baisser, tu peux travailler sur l’aspect qualitatif afin de te faire aider plus efficacement dans ton projet de startup. En clair: plus tu auras de connaissances et d’expérience, moins tu auras du mal à trouver un développeur et/ou des conseils utiles pour t’aider.Alors voici un sommaire des questions auxquelles tu dois savoir répondre, si tu veux avoir toute l’attention d’un bon développeur:Attention: avoir lu le livre d’Eric Ries, suivi des milliers de blogs sur l’entrepreneuriat, adoré mon Une fois que tu auras suffisamment avancé dans ton projet pour savoir répondre en toute confiance à ces trois questions, tes interlocuteurs auront suffisamment d’éléments pour apprécier ta démarche, et avoir envie de t’aider à franchir les prochaines étapes de ton projet.Il y a quelques mois, j’ai listé les éléments que je demandais systématiquement aux créateurs de startups qui me contactaient, et en ai fait un article: “Voici un résumé de ce que tu devras retenir suite à ta lecture de cet article:Enfin, un dernier conseil: évite d’exagérer, ou d’utiliser des mots plus complexes que nécéssaire pour valoriser toi ou ton projet.

We spend too much of our waking lives being fed information through screens. Taking a few days out to unplug, have meaningful conversations and get back to the things that matter is priceless.Each evening we had 120 people sharing food and wine in the stunning barn and the conversation flowed. If only all networking was like this.We’ve had such incredible feedback from campers that now want to be part of a bigger community of likeminded people. Without a transformative weekend such as Summercamp this spirit would have been harder to come by. It feels like we’re at the start of something beautiful.We had some incredible speakers who’ve made a positive dent in the world, but they didn’t follow the rules. Don’t be afraid to challenge the status quo. Be brave, be yourself, be different.Great quote from Laila Pawlak in her LEGO serious play session and great advice for business too.It doesn’t matter which country you come from or what you’re looking to build or change. It’s about spending more time with people that believe in the same things you do and inspiring each other to do great things.We heard heartfelt stories of love and loss, and how this makes us re-assess our priorities. Don’t wait for bad news to spark a change, be your own catalyst.We strive for a culture of openness and kindness at our events and this was no more apparent than at Summercamp. We’ve never seen such a wilingness to share ideas and help each other when people have known each other for such little time. Amazing.Thanks to Sanderson we now are hooked on Danish clapping (even the Danish present hadn’t heard of it…).Says it all.Hope you enjoyed this post.

First time startup CEOs are rarely qualified for their jobs. How could they be? There’s really no other role that can properly prepare you for managing every department, a board of directors, fundraising, mergers and acquisitions, and bankruptcy to boot. “Fake it until you make it” is essentially the only viable option.But at some point, imitation gives way to competence. You’re doing the CEO job and doing it well. You’re focused on the things you’re good at, and have found wonderful people to do the things you stink at. The company’s going well.So why do you feel like a failure?The matter is not helped by the amazing degree to which entrepreneurs are “killing it,” “crushing it,” and various other phrases normally attributed to insect exterminators. The press is full of these stories, and in casual confirmations you hear more of the same — everyone’s best features are on display.But if you burrow down to a level of honesty and trust with a startup founder, you sometimes hear a different story. Actually, not just sometimes. Always.One truth you hear is that things aren’t all roses. Perhaps funds are running low. Cofounders are at each others’ throats. The valuation was low. Investors are talking about replacing management.That’s not what I’m talking about.The even more deeply buried truth I’m talking about is this: most entrepreneurs feel like impostors. Impersonators, unable to do their jobs, struggling not to be called out for their incompetence.The first time I had someone confess this to me it was a revelation. I think the exact form of the revelation was me rapidly replacing my beverage on the table and shouting “Me too!” at a volume inappropriate to the venue in which we were seated.We were both reasonably successful entrepreneurs at that point; we knew what we were doing. Yet we both felt like we were faking it.Even more strangely, as I get to live out my science fiction dreams developing a 3D laser printer at While there’s no formal research on entrepreneurs, the symptoms we were experiencing are far from unique. They were first described in 1978 by Dr. Pauline Rose Clance — under circumstances not too dissimilar to mine.In an attempt to get to the bottom of this, I had the pleasure of talking to Dr. Rose Clance at her home in Georgia. Thirty-five years after her groundbreaking paper on the Imposter PhenomenonDr. Rose Clance grew up in rural Appalachia. She was a model student and got an undergraduate liberal arts degree at Lynchburg College. Throughout high school and college she experienced bouts of self-doubt, as any of us might when faced with a dramatically new and challenging environment. But when she was accepted to the graduate program at the University of Kentucky, it was different.The psychology program at the University of Kentucky was rigorous and strict. Twenty-five students were admitted, and most of them would wash out before being awarded their PhD.Every two weeks, a faculty member would lecture on a subject of his or her expertise. Every two weeks, there was a test. And every two weeks, someone was at risk of being sent home.The pressure was brutal. Everyone felt it. As exams finished, students would thump their books down and escape to a local watering hole to debrief and decompress.Pauline felt it more than most. Every two weeks, she’d collapse on a stool and confide in her friends. She didnt think she had what it took to make it through the program. Every missed question glared at her in retrospect. Every concept she failed to fully grasp, every lecture she didnt quite understand, every theory she didnt perfectly commit to memory loomed large.And even more than this, she truly believed that she shouldnt be there in the first place. Pauline grew up in rural Appalachia. She didnt have the educational background of many of her peers. She was proud of her education and her history, but she told herself that — if she was being honest — she just wasnt prepared for the program. Fortunately, she had a group of three close friends she could confide in.Until they told her to shut up about it.You see, Pauline was, for lack of a better description, crushing it. She was nailing every test. She was outperforming many of her friends and peers. The data was not matching the hypothesis. She was, in fact, fully qualified, and was on a trajectory to graduate with outstanding marks.Imposter Phenomenon affects different people differently. Some are crippled by it; some are motivated by it. Pauline had the presence of mind to listen to her friends when they set her straight, and the perspective to be able to analyze what they were telling her objectively. She realized that her fears, while real-seeming, were ultimately unfounded. She finished her program and got her degree.Her experience made it hard not to notice, several years later as a professor and working psychotherapist herself at Oberlin, when a stream of highly qualified students came to her with secret confessions.“I think I’m going to fail.”“Maybe I got in by mistake.”“Maybe I’m just here because my dad knew someone.”Three decades later, in her lilting, Georgia-inflected voice, Dr. Pauline Rose Clance described her breakthrough moment thusly: “Maybe I wasnt just a hillbilly imposter after all!”The young doctor realized that there was a common undercurrent to the students seeking her advice. She wrote a paper — the first published work on the subject — where she hypothesized that the Imposter Phenomenon selectively affected women early in their careers, based on her clinical observations and interviews with both male and female students. She also developed, and over the years studied and refined, the first test to assess the degree to which people suffer from IP. You can take it yourself But it was only after years of research and administering the test to thousands of subjects anonymously that she discovered that IP was not restricted to either women or people who were early in their careers. In fact, men suffered from IP just as frequently as women. And while it is normal to experience uncertainty and self-doubt when faced with a new challenge, severe cases of IP would persist throughout a career, in the face of mountains of evidence that would belie it.So it wasnt just women and youths who suffered, as she had first thought. It was simply that, until she started making her surveys anonymous, men and career professionals refused to admit to it.I talked to Dr. Rose Clance about my experiences with startup CEOs and asked her if she thought it was plausible that there was a high rate of IP to be found in that population.Her answer surprised me.She explained to me that IP wasn’t, in fact, a singular diagnosis of an abnormal condition. It’s not listed in DSM-V, the psychiatrists’ bible of disorders — because it’s not a disorder. It’s not always a negative experience; it can, in fact, be quite positive. That is, incidentally, why she prefers to call it a “phenomenon” instead of a “syndrome.”IP, she said, can do great things.Some individuals with IP use it to propel themselves to tremendous heights. Common symptoms of IP include perfectionism, a tendency to “overwork” — spending long hours at the office to the exclusion of personal obligations — and a habit of pushing themselves to consistently outperform previous benchmarks. IP sufferers are often found in senior jobs, leadership roles, and positions of high prestige.Of course, it’s not all happiness and light. Some IP sufferers are prone to self-sabotage. They may turn down opportunities due to self-doubt. They may procrastinate out of a fear of failure. They may fail to delegate, out of concern of letting their superiors down. Even those who accomplish great things may do so at the expense of social and family relationships. And IP sufferers are prone to anxiety and depression.Startups, in short, are great places to look for the Impostor Phenomenon. As Liquid Planner CEO Fortunately, there’s quite a bit that can be done to make things better.First off, there are many people who experience the phenomenon without serious problems. For these folks, the worst curse is the feeling of aloneness and nagging doubt that dogs their successes. Just knowing that these feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt are not abnormal or unusual can be a tremendous relief. Sympathy and camaraderie, for these sufferers, can be good medicine.For those who suffer more — experiencing stress or depression, for example — improvement starts by understanding the root of their problem. IP can start naturally when someone is worried about her odds of success, and then achieves her goal. If this repeats over time, a negative pattern can form: worrying about success seems like it must be a natural prerequisite to being successful. Like a gambling addiction, the habit loop locks in: worry, attempt, succeed. Worry, attempt, succeed. With every success, the worries deepen.For those so affected, counseling can be a tremendous boon. Therapy for IP can include breaking the habits of worry, self-examination, priority setting… pretty straightforward stuff, where the therapist may be able to make a difference quickly. Electroconvulsive treatments are rarely required.I’ve talked about this with a number of startup luminaries, and one of my Glowforge investors, “I don’t trust someone who doesnt have a little bit of that faker feeling. If there’s a spectrum from ‘I’m a fuckup’ to ‘I’m perfect,’ I don’t want to see them on either extreme.”Chris told me that he doesnt bet on CEOs who wear their insecurities on their sleeve.“I want it farther from the surface. I want someone who’s just humble enough to get help, not someone who’s either so confident or so insecure that they never ask questions.And that’s the last, crucial misconception that needs dispelling. Perhaps, freed by the knowledge that you are not alone, you will be inspired to shout the truth from on high and/or in your next shareholder update, “I think I’m an imposter! I’m pretty sure my success is due only to luck! I don’t think I’m a very good CEO for my company!”This is probably a mistake. As much as secrecy contributes to the problem, it may not be in the interest of you personally or of your company generally to have this conversation in a public forum — at least, not until your track record of success is well established. When Thor Miller and Lane Becker, founders of the well-known company Get Satisfaction, write a book called As a parting thought, consider the lessons of the Dunning-Kruger effect: researchers Justin Kruger and David Dunning determined that low-skilled people tend to suffer from poor self-assessment skills, just like highly functional people suffer from IP. In the case of these poor incompetents, however, the assessment was reversed: the lowest performers would assess their skills the most highly. So take heart in your self-doubt: if you were truly an incompetent fake through and through, you would probably think you were perfect.CEO of Glowforge. Creator of Robot Turtles.

In physics there is a term for speed needed to “break free” from the gravity — Is there anything more important for startup that a speed? Sam Altman said that: “Move fast. Speed is one of your main advantages over large competitors”. Lean Startup by Eric Ries is mostly about speed. What would it mean for a startup to maximise speed and avoid crash? Let’s find out!Startups also move at a certain speed. Speed in physics is a distance covered by a time it takes. For startups it would be the progress they make divided by time. Assuming that the main resource for a startup is time and progress is expressing the business value, this measure of speed is equivalent to ROI (return of investment).As a startup you operate under huge uncertainty. You cannot predict the outcome of your next iteration. Your hypotheses can turn right, but unfortunately in most cases they turn wrong. The only thing you can do is to run a test and see. In a result, the progress startups make with each iteration is on average very small, because out of ten ideas you test, you are lucky if few of them become successful.To express this worrying fact in our model, let’s break down the iteration progress into expected win and its chance of occurrence (success chance). As you can see small success chance of iteration is decreasing every startup’s speed. We have to deal with it.The good news is that you have a big impact on the bottom part of the formula. You manage how much it takes to ship the feature or A/B test to the market. Iteration time consists of two main factors:Driving down the time of development and all the overheads you can significantly increase the iteration speed of your startup. If testing a minor change takes longer than few hours it means that you face some serious problems with product development and you should start with this point. Also if you spend the third hour trying to convince somebody to your idea, you should probably be already testing it. Less talking, more doing.Is there anything you can do to increase the progress you make with each iteration? Absolutely, check out the following ideas:Ok, having the complete model let’s us it in practice.Some time ago I’ve advised a startup who faced challenges with the development time. It was a team of amazing, talented people willing to make a difference but not able to make a single move forward with their product. Development and deployment of a small feature was rarely shorter than a week time. Good ideas got stuck in the backlog for much too long. People got frustrated and nothing changed.To avoid this problem they come up with a solution to assess each idea by its business value and technical complexity (very close to our iteration speed, however not including the risk/success chance). They wanted to limit the number of ideas by requiring each of them to have detailed analysis as a backup so that they can precisely assess the potential return.Why it didn’t work?The initial approach focused on the wrong things. By not addressing slow development time, limiting the stream of new ideas and requiring extensive research as an input for each iteration, it drastically slowed down the startup speed. They should rather focus on reducing the deployment time and all the overheads (including extensive research) to make sure that as many ideas as possible got tested.Below key take-aways from the Startup Speed Model:===Head of International Growth @ Brainly || Startups | Innovation | Education || wojtekskalski.comAll things #startup, venture capital,  #technology.

I want to talk about building a startup team. But rather than talk about There is a set of assumptions, understood and adopted by every successful founder, that guides them towards successfully building their team. As a founder, you too must adopt this mindset. Doing so will save you from falling into the trap in which the vast majority of founders find themselves, and from which most startups never return. These assumptions can broadly be stated as such:No one can build a business alone. Even Steve Jobs was quick to admit that. You need great people to build awesome products. You need people to market and sell those products and to come up with — and execute — ideas that you (admittedly) would never have conceived alone. No matter how brilliant an entrepreneur you are, the fate of your startup ultimately rests on the shoulders of the team around you. Therefore, recruiting activities are paramount.In the early days you’ll rely heavily on your own network to build your team. You’ll bring in trusted friends and make a few opportunistic hires that will lull you into the false belief that recruiting is an easy chore. Later on, however, as your business gains traction and your hiring accelerates — at the same time as your personal responsibilities grow exponentially — you’ll start to realise the massive effort required to scale a company from 5 to 20 employees and beyond. At this point, you’ll need to build a systematic, multi-functional recruiting machine.Notice how I said Ask every successful founder you know and they’ll all tell you the same thing. It’s the founders’ responsibility to build the team and failure to do so will land your company on the scrapheap faster than you can say “I beg you to come and work for me.”There’s an often cited But the strongest supporting evidence doesn’t come from analysing failed startups, it comes from studying the ones that succeeded. At the core of every one of them exists a fundamental trait possessed by the CEO that compels them to hire only world class team players. Oracle’s Larry Ellison admits that “on your own, you’re nothing. But when you’ve got a team like this around you, they can make you look great.” Even the most cursory Googling of “why X company succeeded” will lead you to articles about their founders’ espousing the virtue of hiring great people from the outset.It’s also important to note that assembling a strong team and being able to speak fluently about your hiring plans will give investors a great deal of confidence in you and your abilities. Ron Conway, the famed angel investor, I have the privilege of meeting many first time founders in my role, mostly from startups working with our investment team. When I sit down with them to discuss their hiring plans, the first thing I ask is “what effort will you make and how much time will you spend building your team?” The answers I get are varied and always telling. Some get it right. Others dreadfully underestimate the effort they’ll need to build their teams.A solid rule of thumb for venture-backed startups is that founders should spend Here’s what Mark Zuckerberg The most successful founders don’t just accept the massive effort required to build a team and then carry out of the work alone. Instead they involve every single employee in the hiring process, weaving recruitment into the fabric of the company’s culture. They designate entire days to recruiting and enlist everyone in the company to pitch in. They constantly reinforce the need for referred candidates. Essentially, they turn the company and workforce into a hiring machine.—Are you the founder of a venture-backed startup? If you work a typical 70 hour week, do you spend 23 of those hours building your team? If not, you may need to reassess the efforts you spend on recruiting. Every successful startup founder can’t be wrong.Head of Talent 

(Plus a bunch of questions you need to answer before the launch.)If you asked me, I’d say:It’s like the 50/50 rule from Imagine the following scenario:You’ve worked hard to build the “perfect” app. You’ve fixed any possible bugs, made it look beautiful, and just “know” your market’s out there. On the day of the launch maybe you get lucky and a couple of people write about it, and maybe you even get on Product Hunt. You’re thinking, “wow, I’ve made it”. After the buzz dies down, you’re left with a thousand or so customers who don’t stick around much, and your bounce rate is so big, it would look great if you replace “bounce” with “conversion”.What happened?! Simply put, you relied on things that don’t last: both press and Product Hunt will give you a nice boost, but you need to build a steady foundation first in order for the buzz to continue building.Even when you think your app is doing well, it might be dwindling, and by the time you realize, it would be too late, and you’d have to start from the beginning. That’s why you have to have someone on the team who cares about metrics and measures practically everything.Question:If it’s traffic traffic, that won’t help you long-term.If it’s conversions, great! But are people who converted sticking around or have they abandoned your app right after they installed it? If it’s the latter, I suggest you devise an evil plan to email them a week after and see what went wrong. Maybe there’s a good reason and they can tell you what to improve.If it’s how engaged people are with your product, I congratulate you. You’re on the right track because retention is the most elusive of metrics but also the most beautiful. Basically, it’s the white fox of the startup world.I’m fed up with unicorns anyway.So you’ve got an app. And a landing page with cute pictures, maybe you’re on twitter, facebook, and you’re going through the motions to be social and human and … wait a second, how long have you been doing this for?If you just started because you’ve just launched, I think you missed a few steps in between. Experts advise to start marketing as soon as your idea is born. The longer you stagger the release, the better, but there’s also the other side of the coin — telling people “this amazing app is launching soon” and one year later it’s still a vacant twitter account and no updates in sight.You have to find the balance and set your own pace. It’s worth it.I was going to write an entire blog post about “the common denominator of viral apps”, but this will do. You’re probably thinking it’s something super sexy, but it’s rather something super simple — Why do you think all the best marketers offer free ebooks on their sites?Because freebies equal subscriptions. And every good marketer knows that email is the Holy Grail. Content may be King and Social it’s Queen, but email is the ultimate goal because it’s the most direct way you can contact someone. Everybody has just one inbox (or at least one main one) and they covet it, so when they subscribe, you’ve entered their shrine.Here’s what the experts do — set up a landing page and give something for free. Or only give early access to some people. Or better yet, release your app for free and show people how fun it is to use before they have to subscribe. My point is, give something for free before you ask for anything in return. And NEVER ask for my credit card at the start. Huge turn-off.I’m a fan of the book Traction. In it, you can read about the “Bullseye Framework”. Basically, you have to do little experiments to find the channels that work for you, but you must never say “no, this won’t work” until you’ve tried it.Once you find something that works, you must really hone in on it. For example, it might be a specific user segment or a specific social platform. Whatever it is that’s really bringing the big bucks, I think you’re supposed to focus on 3 channels and work on those, but never spread yourself too thin. I’m assuming you’ve done your market research and you know where your users hang out by now, so get going.You can’t just expect people to use your app. It doesn’t happen.What happens is — people see something cool, they think about trying it but without context or an additional reason to carry on, their interest fizzles out.In this case, I recommend finding a way to engage your early users. I mean the ones that are really excited about the product. Whether they have four stars on Think about it like this: Your goal should not be finding new people endlessly. It’s why I open Product Hunt daily. Because he gave me a reason to stick around, then the product became a habit, and BOOM. I am hooked.Referrals are usually the most dependable source of conversions. Whether you have launched already or you’re building up to it, it’s important to encourage your users / beta testers to share the app with their friends.Some marketers use “tweet to download” gimmicks, but I personally prefer well-placed buttons and opportunities to share on social. Furthermore, if your product is good and you’re engaging your users, chances are word-of-mouth will happen naturally. That’s usually the tipping point.Finally, I can’t really give an example other than my own startup because those are the metrics and results I know best, so let’s go with that.Here’s how we do it at In the end, everything comes down to this:Mike (my co-founder) and I have come up with our own My idea is that pre-launch is like a tsunami (hang in there) — each wave builds up on the last until one huge wave floods everything and brings after-waves until it settles. After that, ideally, there’s steady growth.It’s in the molding of both that we have found our strategy.*Writes a lot. Articles that could help your startup grow.

A more efficient way of building startups, or just a futile attempt to reinvent the wheel?Building startups is notoriously hard. Often, entrepreneurs have to spend too much time on scraping together the basics. A few people who can hack together an initial product. Some funding so they don’t have to starve for their big idea. If you ever tried to build a startup, you know the feeling.And from the investor’s point of view? Every time they want to invest in a new company, they have to wet new people, go through all the basics again and again.And the result? Nine out of ten times startups fail. The team scatters, founders face downtime, sometimes even depression.Put your hand on your heart, and tell me: is this really the over-romanticized world of startups you so much desire?Pioneered by The big promise of the model is this: the studio provides an ideal base for entrepreneurs to quickly dish out new concepts. Because there are resources available in-house, the team can focus on the product and the customer. And for the investor it can be a steady deal flow source.Since Idealab kicked it off, more and more studios have been emerging. Some founded by successful entrepreneurs, some by investors or investment firms. The more famous ones include There are approximately a hundred studios out there, and this number is rapidly growing. Strangely, the model seems to be more wide-spread outside Silicon Valley. For now, we don’t know why. Maybe the studio model shines where there is no critical mass of talent and funding opportunities?What we know for certain is that studios are on the rise. Take a look at publicly available data (like CrunchBase), and you find exciting insight.If the trend continues, we could have around 10 new studios and 60 new, funded portfolio companies by end of 2015. This number might jump to 15 new studios and around 80-90 new portfolio companies in 2016… You’ve gotta love the hockey stick curve!But there is still much to do to make the startup studio model mainstream. There are concerns both from entrepreneurs and investors.Is any of this true? For now, we can neither confirm nor dismiss any of these claims.When it comes to discussion about startup studios, too often the answer is In the following months, we will be looking at different aspects of these studios. We will try to decode the “genome” of a successful startup studio:It is in our common interest to make this model more transparent and better understood. For entrepreneurs, studios can offer a more efficient way of building startups. For investors, studios can become a much more reliable deal flow source. For already existing studios, making the model transparent might help recruit talent and raise more funds for expansion.Let’s make this happen!Entrepreneur, CEO of Firmpalace.com, startup studio pundit

Due to my experience in the Startup World and having a great relationship with a wonderful woman, I recognized a lot of similarities about the way you should build a great Team.The first step in both worlds is to find people you like and you want to hang out with. This step is all about getting to know each other to see if you want to work and live together over the next years. In the Startup World, the people aren’t as emotional about these early breakups. They understand that it’s the best for both. They appreciate each other for being honest and for telling as soon as possible if things aren’t working out. This saves time and energy for both and takes them one step closer to a better fitting partner.When it comes to relationships, the people tend to be a lot more emotional about these breakups. Instead of respecting the decision and be thankful for the person for being honest, they are looking for reasons, excuses and someone to blame. I think we should see it more as a trial-and-error phase with a lot of fun and meeting great people. It would save time and energy as well.After you assembled a team and feel the connection to the person, you should start working on the shared value of yours. They are very important because You should ask each other, what is important for you, what kind of person do you want to be, where and how do you want to live, how many kids you want and so on. You should share your history with each other, what made you to the person you are today. How do you treat others and how do you want to be treated. Tell each other about your strength and weaknesses and about your working expertise. In this phase, After you shared your value, you can create a shared vision of your future. This is a very important part. In the startup world, you have to clear out how long you will commit to each other and to your startup. It is better for you if you commit on a certain period of time instead on an idea. Because your idea will change on this journey anyways and you will be iterating a lot. So you better make sure that you will be there for each other for a certain period of time. In my opinion, some time between two and three years is a good time frame to work with.For relationships, this step is huge, because it can last for the rest of your life. So you better make sure that you both are on the same page when it comes to life planning. There is nothing worse than waking up one day and realize that you want a completely different lifestyle. For example, if you realize you want to live in warm weather at an ocean instead of living in a cold region in the mountains as your partner wants to. That doesn’t mean you can’t do both, but you should have talked about it before and check if you can connect both worlds. The same goes for family planning, when you want to have a big family, you should check if your partner has the same preferences.Now you have completed the first big phase of building a great startup or relationship — you built a good team. Next you have to think about the execution of the team, or as To have a team execute well, you have to clear out responsibilities. You have to address certain fields to the team members and make them responsible for them. This doesn’t mean they have to do all the work on their own, they just have to make sure that the work will be done. You also have name leaders on certain topics. This will be important when you have to make decisions even though not everyone agrees on it.In Startups, you often have bigger teams and then you should also name a referee. The referee mediates when members get into an argument. But the referee also has to decide, who is right about the argument from the startup point of view. The different fields are mostly business development, administration, finance, marketing  sales, design, coding, engineering and so on.For relationships, the fields are more about finance  administrations, household, grocery shopping, work, taking care for the kids, and so on. In my relationship, my wife is in charge of the household, but still I have to do some parts of it. I like to vacuum for example, I think those new vacuum cleaners look really awesome and it is fun to hunt some dust down. So it was an easy decision to assign that task to me.The last step is to implement a good communication strategy. Where do you communicate, how do you schedule appointments and how do you communicate deadlines should be some of the questions you should answer in this section. This isIn our After you successfully build your team and planned your execution, you can start thinking about ideas and their implementation.In the Startup World, this means finding real needs and working with new technologies.For Relationships, this is more about planning your next weekend or vacations.And don’t forget to iterate once in a while and most important:Open minded with focus on Marketing and Business Development. Love to think about ideas around new technologiesThis is a collections for articles about business including startups, business developments, and management. Managed by 

Budget 2015 and its supporting documentation was a nail in the coffin of Ireland pushing on and being a true player on the international tech scene. We are not in the top 20 worldwide by most metrics and to be honest we are a long way off being so. In this budget the government further enhanced their strategy of being a good tax haven and EMEA headquarters for foreign multinationals, while simultaneously deciding that local startups don’t hit their election buttons.Where is the outrage from startups? We had a whole hullaballoo about the web summit leaving but barely a murmur from the community in relation to the Government’s “Tax and Entrepreneurship Review”. This boring crap is the stuff that will define how your startup will be funded.Startups are about money. Some people may think they are about hanging out in a cool office, coding on a comfy beanbag or getting to have a pint with the CEO of a unicorn at a pub summit. They are not! They are about money. Making money. Selling product. Selling Companies. Re-investing the winnings (if there is any) and doing it again but bigger.Startups are expensive. There is a myth that you can launch your startup for a tiny amount of cash. Yes you can if you can code and if you can translate that small amount of code into customers (or investors) straight away but the odds are even then you still need cash to scale.For most software startups there is a lot more coding needed than people realise and those coders need to eat, pay rent, live, etc in the meantime. For the non-coding founders of which there are many then these costs can be even higher.For hardware startups the costs can be even higher again. Yes we all know about Arduino chips and the host of simple and cheap tools that can be used to prototype but it still costs a lot to build something of substance.In short startups need investment to get started. Most founders don’t have it so they need help. They are too small for debt so they need Investors.In Ireland the government is killing investment in startups. The great community we have won’t last long of it is slowly strangled to death.Governments have choices as to how they support and promote businesses.The UK government decided to let the market decide who should get funded. They give tax breaks to incentivise the investors not to put their money into their pensions or saving schemes but to risk it on early stage ideas.The Irish government decided they knew better than the markets and they gave a pot of money to a semi-state and allow people to queue up and ask for grants, investment and advice. This semi-state Enterprise Ireland once referred to themselves as the biggest VC in Europe.There are two problems with the Irish Solution. Maths and Business Logic.Giving a grant (or government investment) of €1 or a tax break of €1 costs the taxpayer the same amount……but the difference to the startup is huge.If a government agency is to give out the €1 to the startups then this costs them money to administer. Quite often about 70% of the money goes on administering the grant/investment. This means the startup ends up with 30c. Even if the startup has to raise matching investment this still only comes to 60c that the startup has in their bank account. 70c goes to the state agency — that is more than the total the startup gets.With a tax break the situation is much better for the startup and the taxpayer. The taxpayer has little or no overheads but says to the startup, “If you can find somebody crazy enough to give you €1.50 we will give them €1 tax back”. In this case the startup gets €1.50.In real terms the gap can often be much bigger than 60c to €1.50 shown above. Quite often it can mean 5–10 times as much cash for the startup.Meanwhile the taxpayer gets all the same upside in terms of jobs, taxes, etc — in fact they get more as the startup has more to spend.Every year thousands of Irish startups queue up to ask a civil servant for a grant/investment. New Frontiers, CSF, HPSU, etc, etc…the list goes on. This is not fair on the civil servant.Why the civil servant? Well they are giving out the taxpayer’s money and they have a duty of care to the taxpayer. They can’t just throw the cash about. That is why the process is slow, procedural, rigid and of course infuriating to startups.Of course the startup suffers hugely too. Despite the fact they are trying something new they must fit within a formulae that a government defined as leading to a successful business. Innovation and rigid, slow systems don’t often work well together.Tax and Entrepreneurship Review. The government put out their response/findings from their recent public consultation on tax and entrepreneurship. Feel free to read it but the short summary is that nothing is changing and if anything it’s about to get worse.Key FindingsWhat the government pretty much said, “We looked at that in 2014 and won’t be changing it. We promised to take a look again in 2016 if people are not investing”We have shown through freedom of information requests that investments are down 1/3 since the system became more draconian. Hardly any accountants encourage the system to their clients as a tax incentive scheme anymore.What the government said, “We are happy to leave this as it is”.This is disgraceful. Its costing thousands of RD jobs a year.There are lot of others but I won’t bore you with them. Needless to say it’s pretty much all the same thing. “No we won’t be doing that anytime soon…we can’t afford it”Yes well this was the nugget thrown in by Brendan Howlin. In 2016 Ireland will give €500m or (€1/2 Billion) to our enterprise agencies.Just to make the difference clear that is about €12m-€15m on investor tax breaks and €500m to government agencies.In short the balance is not right. We need to have less CSF, less HPSU, less New Frontiers and more private investors. It would be great to have both but the country can’t afford it.This is not a dig at the nice people working in the IDA — they are selling Ireland well and should continue.This is not a dig at the nice people working in Enterprise Ireland — they are doing what they are mandated to do. It’s just that their mandate is misguided.If you think I am wrong about our Irish model then look at how unsuccessful the scheme Enterprise Ireland ran to attract early stage startups to come and launch their business in Ireland was.We said come here and take advantage of our government led investment schemes. How many came? I can only think of a handful.How is it that we can attract all the top American Startups like Hubspot, Twitter, Adroll, LinkedIN, etc but we couldn’t get more than a few early stage ones? The answer is simple. Startups go where the money is and there is not enough here. Plus government money takes ages to get.Compare this to London, right next door to us. They are a global centre of finance, their startup investment numbers are going through the roof, their eco-system is top 5 worldwide, etc, etc. I would wager than I could find a lot more Irish startups that moved to London than startups our agencies to could get (from anywhere in the world) to move to Ireland.Absolutely not. But we should give the guys in there a chance to do more meaningful work. Cut back the HPSU and CSF investments. Give tax breaks to investors and then get Enterprise Ireland work with companies that have some market validation to sell, scale and export.Enterprise Ireland and the IDA have built an incredible global network and we should use that instead of having us founders driving them all nuts looking for the latest grantUnfortunately yes.1. The simple fact is that as an investor in extremely early stage businesses it’s vital that our portfolio companies have access to a range of seed and follow on investment.2. UK  US businesses are more appealing as they will have a better chance of being financed properly.3. We will actively encourage Irish startups to raise money in the UKa. From January onwards we are extending our services and directly raising follow on money in the UK and US for our clients.b. This will however mean that some will have to move much of their business to the UK and/or the US. This will costs Irish jobs. It’s unfortunate that this is the consequence of these Government decisions.1. Keep telling the politician that shows up to your event that you want private investors and not government investment…..it’s that easy!!!a. Tell them without money you can’t compete.2. Tell Enterprise Ireland you want their help getting investors and not getting their investment.a. Tell them they must be more like the Israelis and they must help get International investors for you.b. Tell them to spend their money getting you out to meeting international investors and customers3. We have a friendly community and enthusiastic people. Keep selling Ireland.4. Sell your product and scale your business.a. Try look after the rest of us when you do.Remember every time you hear an announcement about more HPSU, more CSF, more investments all you are hearing is more about our failure to see the reality of government led investment.Finally just for the sake of full disclosure I will outline my personal experiencesa. Granted I started in 2009 in the middle of the recessionb. It felt impossible then and it seems the same now for many of the startups we deal with.a. There are hardly any Irish investment bankers, financial advisors or accountants helping early stage companies raise money in Irelandb. Why? Because the investment market is not there. Founders may not realise it but when you launch it is really helpful to have a range of advisors who will sell you really useful services like raising money.c. London is full of people offering the service and with access to real moneyd. The accountants are particularly poor with only a handful of specialistsa. They gave me good advice as a first time founderb. They gave me a grant within 8–10 weeks of meeting themi. I would point out that a prior company I worked for had made them a lot of money so it was an easier sellc. They invested €200,000 into our businessi. They said it would take 9–10 months and it didii. Its was too slow and extremely costly but it was all that was available.d. The best things Enterprise Ireland did for me cost them very little moneya. It’s disgraceful that companies all over Ireland are waiting for RD rebates. We are owed hundreds of thousands of euros right now.b. In England I have been paid and have re-invested it already in my business and othersa. They are better than you think.b. Learn to speak their language and they will give you money. Even Irish ones.Helping startups happenHelping startups happen | A venture technology firm based in Dublin

I remember the beginning of 2014 — it started with the usual wishes people make on New Year’s Eve. At that time, I wanted to have a higher income, more breath-taking moments with my friends, and many opportunities to travel, see and learn new things…Start-up life is not an easy one, though. Most people — including most of my friends, too — think that a funded start-up means less work and more money. But, to be honest, I have never worked as much as I did in the past year; and I am sure I could have earned way more if I had continued to work as a developer. But still, if someone asks me now to pick between a peaceful and “secure” life or a first-time entrepreneurial experience, I would definitely go for the second option every single time. This is because I have learned, felt, and experienced things that you can’t encounter anywhere else and, things that you simply have to experience!So which are the most important lessons that left a mark in the last twelve months?I have seen many founders dividing their businesses into product and marketing part, or product development and business development, traction and services — you name it, they have it. There are many other small roles — accounting and legal e.g. — yet at first, I also thought that is what you mainly do in a start-up — build and sell. Things are different in reality, though. If you had met me on the street a couple of months ago and asked me “Hey Volen, how is Have you wondered why there are plenty of people that smoke? Although there are so many videos and books about what smoking can cause, when you go out you will definitely see someone with a cigarette in hand. They know it is unhealthy, but they will not stop until the problems come.Ok, let’s make that clear — before making It may sounds ridiculous, but this was the hardest lesson for me to learn. Look, I am the kind of guy that always goes out, always likes to be with someone, and always finds a way to enjoy the moment. I don’t think I have changed much but being in a start-up maybe somehow changed the way I think. I remember frequently saying to my friends — “Hey can we meet next week, I am a bit busy right now”. Sadly this was almost every week. I thought that we could be something more — we could have a better product, more customers, be a better team and so on. I was so obsessed with our vision that sometimes I’d forget to celebrate what we had achieved. And believe me — as first-time entrepreneurs in a start-up together we had achieved a lot. Nevertheless, it wasn’t enough for me.Believe me or not, the review that I talked about costed me 3 days. I simply couldn’t stop writing down the things I have learned, the things I have to start, stop or continue doing. But if I have to prioritize them, as I have said before, I will give you those five advises. If you haven’t been in a start-up, do it. It may sound like a cliché, but it will change your life. It will change the way you think and the way you see the world. Enhancv is a web-based app that turns your ordinary old-fashioned resume into a powerful tool for winning interviews!

For the uninitiated, the Lean Startup methodology is a practice for developing products and businesses based on ‘validated learning’, getting customer feedback quickly and often. The process was proposed by Eric Ries in 2011. The objective is to eliminate uncertainty in the product development process. This practice has transformed the way companies are developed.Instead of building in isolation from users, startups regularly expose the product to customers throughout the development cycle. In doing so, teams are able to make more informed decisions about what to build, from core product functions to what colour a button should be. This sounds sensible, common sensical and is very practical in the making of a digital businesses.It is no surprise then, that in recent years, it has become the new norm for how to build a startup. It has even made its way into the minds of those building non digital businesses. There is much to credit the lean startup methodology for, but what are some of the issues that have emerged from this new convention changing our mindsets?As more people begin to believe that entrepreneurship is the solution to their corporate woes, more products emerge to educate people in how to become entrepreneurs. It is not surprising then that the methodology has been repackaged, repurposed and resold in ‘entrepreneurship courses’ that promise to help you make ‘$1000 a month.’Many of these are by successful, credible entrepreneurs and a lot of them live up to their promises. However, this is only on the grounds that the business you want to start fits with their instructions. In efforts to convert the lean way of thinking into actionable steps, they often produce guidance that is restrictive.For instance, the popular approach of creating a landing page communicating the problem and proposed solution, including a sign up sheet or method to pay, then running a Google AdWords campaign may be sufficient for a validating whether or not to progress with a taxi app or an e-book on fish keeping. However, it might prove massively insufficient for a team wanting to start a luxury hotel to obtain any meaningful information about how to proceed with their business.Existence of such courses and articles, such as ‘3 Steps to Validate Your Business Idea For FREE…almost’ by the Startup Bro’s oversimplifies the process. It fails to cultivate a mindset whereby an individual understands hypothesis testing and knows when to abandon a project. Not because they ran an advert for a week but because they know they have executed on Although I believe that a person giving you money is the best test of whether or not you are building something financially worthwhile, the answer to ‘what is the least and fastest thing I can do so customers will pay me?’, will be dependent on what you want to build. In certain circumstances, quality will be required to make customers buy from you, it might even be Companies like Ikawa, makers of the digital micro coffee roaster had to work for years until they had a shippable prototype. In talks with their founder, Andrew Stordy, he mentioned that “the more physical a product gets, the less lean product development can be.” For a marketplace selling sportswear, a webpage with fake images and a way for customers to pay might be sufficient.However, for designer cosmetics, luxury shoes or jets powered by hydrogen fuel cells, a little more might be required and the journey to getting to something that make customers part with cash might take longer.In an article written for issue 02 of the I wholeheartedly agree and believe this to be true whether your product is digital or physical. The drive for Sometimes we want to make things not because they can be ‘validated’ quickly, but simply because we want to turn our mind’s vision into a reality. Sometimes constantly asking for opinions can be inhibiting. Sometimes we might need to work the other way round — starting with what we want to make and finding people who love it instead of finding out exactly what people want us to make and then making it.The lean startup methodology is something that informs what I make as an individual and how we create as a team. It informs the decision making process, helping us to become more resourceful, focussing time and resources in the right place.Every industry and every product development process, digital or not, has something to take from the lean startup methodology. In an age where we are seeing creativity flourish, even outside of technology, it is unsurprising that this methodology — which was written with digital product development in mind — is being layered onto the production processes of non-digital products.Irrespective of what you are building, whether it be an app or an aeroplane I urge you to embrace not just the subtleties of product creation but also the subtleties of your motivations to create. Then and only then, will you be able to know what are the best actions to make the vision you have in mind become a reality.Profiling innovative start-ups  provides helpful insights for successfully starting a business.

With so much attention being paid to startup accelerators over the last several years, entrepreneurs are clamouring to earn a spot in top tier programs as a first step for their startup. Our base city of Hong Kong has also seen an uptick of local accelerators, many of which are dedicated to specific focuses such as Ever since The idea of joining 500 sort of came by chance. It was mid-April 2014 and we were gearing up to do our first fundraising round. In all honestly, at the time, we actually had little strategy, very few connects, had an unpolished pitch and I couldn’t answer 80% of the questions thrown at me. Then one day my co-founder As I dug more into it and realised how big this could possibly be for us, I definitely began to feel the pressure going into the meeting. The person we met with was Fast forward a month or so, applications for Batch 10 opened and we were on top of it in a heartbeat. There was the usual form filling exercise and we also had to create a Some people would flinch at the thought of giving up 7% so early, and are not sure whether it’s really worth it. My answer is a resounding, one thousand percent YES. I feel, and this is completely my own opinion, when you’re that early, your equity don’t really mean jack anyway. The network alone from 500 Startups is worth at least that much. Not to mention the mentorship, advisory, resources and loads of perks. This holds especially true if you’re fundraising. The 500 brand is strong and no matter what our company was doing, people took notice, both in Asia and in the Valley. At least now people were willing to have a cup of coffee with me. Before that, I hardly got investors to respond to my emails, let alone a meeting. We knew we were badass already and we were a confident bunch, but having 500 behind us gave us a certain level of added validation. In terms of fundraising, there were still no guarantees. Just because we were 500, doesn’t mean people were throwing money at us, so that shouldn’t be the expectation. However, it did open up a whole lot of doors.Aside from the fact that we were in beautiful San Francisco, which was a big part of the experience, we loved everything else about it. The accelerator takes in about 30 companies per batch, all of whom work out of the same space for the duration of the program. That is perk number one. It really wasn’t so much about the neat office space but more so the immediate sense of community that you feel among the other founders. Because many of the other startups come from different parts of the world, we had the opportunity to meet entrepreneurs from Europe, Asia, South America, the Middle East and other parts of the U.S. They brought with them a different perspective in problem solving, approach to business and culture that we have not been exposed to before. I would say the focus on being a global accelerator is one of the biggest advantages for 500. There is also a certain level of bravado and swagger that comes with being at 500. I must admit it was a bit fratty, but we embraced the camaraderie while we were there. We forged a lot of relationships that carried on well after Demo Day.Most of the companies are at a similar stage, with a couple that were a bit earlier and a few that had already reached 1M ARR mark. Generally though, I believe the idea is not to have companies that are too far apart in terms of maturity, in order to keep most of the topics relevant to everyone.The accelerator has a network of 200–300 mentors (maybe more) that comes in and out for office hours with the teams. You can book time with the ones that you want to meet when they’re available. There are also scheduled fireside chats with guest speakers on a weekly basis during lunch. All of these mentors and advisors are heavy hitters in the startup community, and many of whom are successful 500 founders from previous batches.The topics of these talks can range from product development to fundraising to distribution. It’s really up to you what you want to participate in. I always liken the the 500 accelerator to a buffet. Everything is there for the taking, it’s really up to you to prioritise and get the most out of the things that can really help. They don’t shove anything down your throats but the partners do encourage you to use what matters most to your business. Since I was responsible for fundraising and design, The biggest thing about these accelerators is that it all ends with Demo Day. Some are a bit more low-key, while others are accompanied by the usual pomp and circumstance. Our Demo Day definitely came with a certain level of pizazz. The by invite only event was held at the Microsoft Sunnyvale offices with 600+ investors in attendance. This was our graduation of sorts, where each team has a chance to pitch on stage and have their 3 minutes of glory. I probably prepped for that pitch about 300 times by myself and with others for a month leading up to the event. Many of the founders would come together everyday and just go through the pitches over and over again. Ad nauseam. In fact, we heard everyone’s pitches so many times that we’ve memorised each others’ by Demo Day.After we did our thing on stage, we went back to our booths in the adjacent room where investors would come by to ask questions and dig a little deeper in to the business. Despite some misconception, no one was throwing checks at us as we walked off the stage. It just doesn’t happen that way, at least not with 500. However, there were a handful of companies that closed some money from investors they met during Demo Day. We certainly had a lot more interest and were able to line up a slew of investor meetings for the following week. Especially when word of the event started to hit I tend not to describe too many things with a statement like “an experience of a lifetime”, but my time at 500 Startups comes awfully close.Since we didn’t initially intend on joining an accelerator, #batch10 #500strongCEO at Shoplineapp.com, 500 Startups Batch 10, UI/UX Designer, Product Manager, Mac Convert, Sneaker head, NYC Bred, HK Rooted, Striving for Asymmetry.

I HAVE AN entrepreneurial friend who recently launched a travel app that’s pretty cool. It’s an alert system that will tell you whenever there’s a greater than 50% discount on a cool flight somewhere, and it’s called These days, with two little (amazing) kids, a startup of my own, and a wife who is doing her own …and then I came to my senses and deleted the email, unsent.If someone asked me that cookie-cutter question: “What do you know now that you wish you’d known when you started your company?” — my answer would be:I wish someone would have told me how unbe-effing-leavably hard it is to get people to To be fair, someone probably did tell me, but since entrepreneurs mostly like to blog and talk about building products or getting funded, that means that the real work of selling your product can be a surprise to first time entrepreneurs like myself.Case in point: after doing a lot of venue research, getting a very cool logo made, building out our website, and writing up the press release, my co-founder and I announced the first Our gathering is by invitation-only, so we have a much smaller pool of potential customers, and a lot of them are really important people who are used to getting stuff for free. We launched in August 2012, and we found the first qualified Denter with wallet in hand by?January of 2013.The first customer is the hardest get. By contrast: more people have already registered for Dent 2016, ten months out, than had at this point in all prior years combined.The sentiment that made me draft that email to my friend Zac with Amazing Airfare is a great one. It’s a big part of the reason startups do occasionally succeed: people like to root for an underdog. Especially if they like them.But ultimately, an entrepreneur is trying to conjure something from nothing. Without cash, that doesn’t work.

We use Stripe to process payments for our conference registrations, so my phone buzzes with a notification every time someone registers — for some reason people like to register while I’m on a date with my wife, which makes me super popular with her on date nights. ☺So I know exactly who every one of my paying attendees is.Yes, a conference is more of a high-touch, low-volume business than a lot of “consumer facing startups,” (and pricier — so obviously I don’t expect all of my friends to shell out $2,000 for a conference just to “be supportive.”)But the point is: I bet all founders know who their first hundred paying customers are.In other words, I already knew how I could help my friend Zac with Amazing Airfare. So I’ve just signed up for it, despite the fact that I’m super unlikely to actually use any of the deals that come my way.I have also, by the way, recently decided to vote with my wallet to help out a few other friends I know who are doing interesting things (in case you also want to support my friends):(As a side note, I think one of Kickstarter’s great gifts to entrepreneurs is the ability to ask for money without being labeled an evil-doing “capitalist” by your friends.)The next time you hear from a friend who’s starting something cool, either as a side project or “for realsies,” and you feel that friendly urge to support what they’re doing…Instead of sending them an email asking “how can I help?” — which for a starving entrepreneur is just as likely to be read as: “how can I not pay you but still pretend like I’m helping?” — just pull out your wallet and pony up.Trust me, it’s how you can help.Seattleite interested in tech.

When I first moved to San Francisco I spent the first year immersed in startup marketing. I believed that regardless of the company I eventually started, that as long as I understood marketing I would be widely successful.Man was I wrong.What I ended up learning the hard way — when building Flowtown — was that It turns out that THE MOST important aspect is the product — duh, right?That being said, my year spent reading every book, attending all of the best events and meeting the world top marketers wasn’t wasted.I ended up learning a lot about viral loops, marketing tactics and the psychology of a customer’s needs.Back in the day we called it metrics based marketing. It was a discipline of building out the instrumentation required to be able to accurately asses a customer’s experience and growth opportunities.Today it’s called Growth Hacking, which I’ll admit has a better ring to it.What I eventually learned is that when you put it all together, a great marketing strategy + product story + product marketing, you end up building a killer growth engine.When it works, it’s a beautiful thing to watch.It actually reminds me of the power of compound interest. Once it “clicks” it just takes off like a fly wheel.Finding your growth engine is f-ing HARD.It’s hard because you have quite a few major areas to figure out. You have the product, the market and your marketing channels.Some call it P/M (product / market) fit, but that’s just one part of it.To really scale and build towards escape velocity, you need to build an engine that delivers on repeatable and scaleable growth… or what’s called a Growth Engine.Here are my thoughts on the 3 major parts of a well tuned Growth Engine.When I’ve worked on building my own startup’s Growth Engine, or advised others to build theirs, I always go over these three major parts:Each one of them are EXTREMELY difficult to perfect, but when you break them down and look at each holistically, you can start to understand how it all works together.These are activities that generate awareness and visitors to your website. The spectrum of tactics you can use is pretty wide and it ranges from free (time invested) to paid (money invested).At the top of free, there would be inbound marketing (a.k.a. content marketing) where you create content that your ideal customers would love.The middle is a mix of free and paid, things like press and partnerships.The bottom includes all your straight up paid channels like Facebook and radio (yep, radio — have you listened to Sirius lately? .com startups are 10% of the ads).Understanding how each one of these works, how others in your industry have successfully leveraged them or even being aware of their cost and reach in general is a great place to start.You don’t need to be a master at any of them, but it’s good to be generally aware of what’s possible.As I mentioned above, even if you’ve got all the money in the world to spend on marketing it won’t work if you’re product sucks, so let’s discuss that next.The Product Story is the story your customer tells themselves about your solution after they’ve been to your site.It’s their answer to: “Who is this for? How does it work? Why is it different?”, etc.The story is made up of every interaction with the product, from the design, the copy, the way you sign a user up, to what you ask them to do in their first experience.Another way to explain it: Many founders never make a conscious decision as to how their Product Story is told, or what that story should be in the first place.That’s a HUGE mistake.To really dial it in, you need to consider these major components of your product:The Product Story is the MOST important aspect to focus on for startups. It’s what you’re creating every time you add a new feature, redesign your homepage or change your pricing.Once you’ve refined your product to a point that you’ve got your customers excited about the product, then you need to start thinking about how your product will grow on its own, or what I call “Product Marketing.”Once you have an idea of the Marketing Channels you can leverage to get consistent traffic to your product — and you’ve built a product that creates the right Product Story for your ideal customer — then you need to think of ways you can have your product market itself.This is a HUGE area of growth for you company.It’s about thinking through the interactions a customer has with your product and figuring out where it would make sense to ask them to take an action that would cause your product to be presented to a new group of potential customers.If you think about it, every great product has these interactions — if not dozens. Here’s just a small list to give you a sense of what I mean:Asking the user to take an action that makes total sense (ex: Airbnb prompting to post a newly created listing to Craigslist) is the only way to build a sustainable product marketing feature.Many startups fail at growth because they ask their users to do something at the wrong time, or position it in a way that doesn’t make sense (ex: asking to refer a friend before they’ve experienced your products core value).On top of all of those challenges, each feature that helps your product grow also tells a story — and if you do it wrong — it can position you in the wrong light.An example would be asking a user to upload their address book of friends during a sign-up process for a BNB solution. It just tells a different story, almost like your app is a social network because that’s what they expect.The key take away from this post is that you should be thinking about your growth strategy as an engine and ensuring each piece is working properly before moving on to the next one.Most startups die because they try to do too many things at once. When things don’t work out, they can’t figure out what strategy failed, even when one might have shown promise.So for now, just map out the different aspects of your product’s engine and any of the strategies you’ve implemented so far.Are you doing any marketing? Cool … write that down.Do you have an on-boarding flow for your product? … if not, quickly wireframe what you think it should look like.Have you built any features that you hoped would help your product grow? …write those down as well. If you’ve got some data on how they did, that would be a plus to capture as well.Step one is to do an inventory of your product so you know what you’re working with… then from there you can refine, remove or create something that delivers real and sustainable growth!-Family first!

I recently recommended a friend for a PM job at a hot Silicon Valley startup run by another friend. The startup recently raised a big Series A and was looking to scale. I know the risk of linking up two friends in an employment scenario, however, my friend was more than qualified for this job and my founder friend really needed the position filled.While my friend was more than qualified, interviewed well, and the team loved him, etc, the founder decided to pass on my friend. The reason: another candidate with the same skills and experience came along that they hired. The difference between the hired candidate and my friend? The candidate that was hired had the same PM experience but all at big companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google. My friend has spend his entire career at startups.My question is: was this the right move? If you had the choice between nearly two identical candidates and one had all their experience at big successful companies and one had their experience at successful startups, isn’t it safe to choose the candidate that worked at the bigger companies?Put yourself in the founder’s shoes. You just raised a big Series A. You are being pressured by your investors to “go big or go home.” You have aspirations to be a big company. This is Silicon Valley, shouldn’t you hire the absolute best talent we can find? Shouldn’t you hire people who worked at Facebook and Amazon since you want your company to be big like them one day?PMs that only worked at companies such as Facebook and Amazon are super qualified PMs. Huge plus. They also know next to nothing about building a startup. Huge negative. People from larger companies bring the bigger company process, procedure, and culture with them. This leads to premature scaling of your business. The problem is that your startup is not a smaller version of a bigger company. As Steve Blank says, a startup is an experiment looking for a business model, not a smaller version of a larger company. Facebook as over 10,000 employees and billions in profits. My friend’s company has less than 15 employees and no profits. Hire people comfortable working in that environment, who know how to bring a company from 15 people to 150 people. When your startup has 1000 employees and is super profitable you should start to hire PMs from Facebook. In between, you have to hire people who can not only do the job, but also help you grow the business, shape the culture, and constantly evolve the process.I made this mistake several times at my past startups. At one startup we realized that we needed an HR manager. Since we had plans to “go big” we wanted to hire an HR manager who came from a big company. Big mistake. We were a team of 12 but all of a sudden we were doing 360 reviews and had to fill out a form in order to take a day off. At another startup we wanted to enter the “enterprise” space, so we hired some “enterprise” software people from a large enterprise software company and gave them fancy titles. The problem is that people who work as executives at big companies usually don’t roll up their sleeves and build a product. Nor do they know how to scale a company, they know how to keep a big company big, but don’t know how to build a big company. In addition they wanted to fly business class and have personal assistants, things that did not jive with our startup culture.Avoid premature scaling at your company and hire not only the candidates with the best skill set, but also with experience in working at and building a startup. Later on when you are bigger and more mature should you hire the people with bigger company experience.Geek. Entrepreneur. Investor. Mountain climber. Sports fan.

I’ve been wanting to publish our usage numbers for quite some time now. Most would advise against this for various reasons but I didn’t get to where I am today by always listening to advice. I love how transparent Joel and Leo over at For those who are not familiar with Rapchat, it’s an Aside from my desire to be transparent, I want to create a pool of data for early-stage startups that don’t have the cash to spend on fancy market reports. I’ve pored through the web looking for publicly available usage numbers to no avail. Aside from a sponsored post on For the past month, I’ve been in and out of investor meetings. One thing I’ve noticed while fundraising is that VC’s initially have the upper hand since they know benchmark numbers that you don’t. They can tell you that your retention number is low in comparison to the market but you have no idea what the true market retention number is. Most of these numbers were shared with the VC’s in confidence so you will not be able to prod to get these numbers either (trust me, I’ve tried). Now, I don’t think VC’s are evil so I still take those numbers at face value and use them as benchmarks. It’d just be nice to see more data from primary sources (startups).I’m happy with the numbers we’ve seen so far but I have no clue how they stack up against other startups at our stage. I’d love to see other startups come forward and share their numbers publicly as well. Your numbers are what they are. Most likely, they aren’t as good as you’d like so why not see how you stack up and where you need to be. Then, at least you have a target to shoot for. For me, competition is a huge motivator. If I’m told that a competitor has better numbers then I’m instantly motivated to go out and beat their numbers.Without further ado, here are our numbers (I feel like I’m the CEO of a massive public company releasing an earnings report or something). I guess CEO at a bootstrapped startup releasing usage numbers isn’t too far off…We use Flurry Analytics, Facebook’s Insights that comes with their SDK and iTunes Connect to collect all our data.These downloads are reported from iTunes Connect. Rapchat is iOS only so nothing to report from the Google Play store…yet. In 2015, we’ve seen over 300k downloads total.

Hence, why MAU is a vanity metric and not all that telling.To send a rapchat — you pick a beat, record your rap, choose friends to send it to and then send it. On average, a rapchat is between 30–60 seconds.Simply put, retention measures how many users come back to your app This is the metric I’d like to improve the most because it is quite possibly the most important metric for mobile apps.

The rest can be attributed to word-of-mouth growth which we’ve been able to somewhat track on Twitter by seeing people tweet about us and tweet their raps.That about runs the gamut of what I usually show investors and interested parties. I tried to hit the 3 key areas which are growth, engagement, and retention. If there is a certain metric you think I should have in there, let me know and I will update this post to include itI’d like to see other founders do the same. We’re all in this together. The more publicly available data, the better. Ideally, there’d be a website where people could just upload their stats and browse other startups. For now, I encourage founders to post their stats via a blog post on their site or here on Medium until we can figure out a better way to organize it.

Pivots are a fact of life in the startup world. Yet, very few founders, especially first-time founders, will provision for it. The founder mindset is typically focused on a single go-to-market strategy. The investors are sold on the potential based on that initial strategy, signing off a budget calibrated accordingly. Everyone sings the same tune until the shareholders realize, hopefully before it’s too late, that the strategy is going nowhere, and that a radical change is required. This scenario occurs more often than not, While this iterative process appears natural, and with the benefit of hindsight, accepted and even praised as part of the startup folklore, it remains a traumatic event from the inside, and possibly a direct cause for failure. Reversely, if done right, a pivot is almost inevitably cause for success.Structurally, there can only be a handful of pivots within the lifetime of a company. Repeat entrepreneurs may have experienced it multiple times and therefore developed their art of the pivot… hence becoming pivot artists, a trait that VCs should consider as key risk management expertise! Here are a few awesome pivot artists:Let’s go back to our humble startups and itemize some of the issues that may arise during a pivot (with first hand examples):As you can see, Let’s break it down around three main pillars: The product initially defined by the founders typically emanates from a global vision. In some cases, founders will start with the product and later realize, on their own or with external help, that there is a greater vision. Either way, the team must strive to work towards the greater vision, and consider that the product itself is just a means for achieving a greater goal. This serves two distinct purposes: pitch investors at a higher level of ambition (helps with the valuation), but It helps if the vision is both ambitious and not dependent on exogenous platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Apple or Google. With Appsfire, a company that I co-founded in 2010, our vision and mission was to solve “app discovery”. Unfortunately, that vision had very strong dependencies with the App Stores. Towards the end of 2013, changes within the App Store guidelines made our model unsustainable… forcing us to pivot both at the vision and product levels; a much harder feat.Reshuffling the business model, or reshuffling a number of technical assets to re-define the product is much easier than having to start from scratch, in addition to helping keep the momentum and timing to achieve the holy grail: the product-market fit.To that effect, to ensure that the team is effectively able to pivot, it should be composed of two key groups:A third group inevitably exists and is made of people who are either back-office (accounting, finance), sales and business development agents, or technical specialists. During a pivot, some of these people will see their workload dwindle rapidly: if the business model changes, there is perhaps suddenly no more invoices to produce, nothing to sell for a while, or at the technical no need for a specific expertise that made sense pre-pivot. In the US, it’s quite easy to thank people and let them go — a harsh reality and necessity. In France, the labor framework does not make it easy even though, contrary to popular belief, it is definitely possible and reasonable if done right. I would argue that if the reason is communicated properly, employees will understand that the pivot creates a “casting mismatch” and that they are often better off by leaving the company. Working with them on their transition to a new job, or mutually agreeing on a smooth “exit” will give them ample time to rebound at a reasonable cost to the startup (the rest will be covered by the government’s unemployment subsidies).At the capitalistic level, the pivot brings an interesting paradoxical twist. While the team and founders may have found a way to better address the market, they will almost inevitably do so from the existing cap table, and without fresh capital. Pivoting means the board acknowledges a local failure, and yet, the action of pivoting, in fact allows a swift and more educated go-to-market approach, bearing less risk, and therefore value creating.It could be argued that if the pivot is radical enough, then the team and founders should probably start from a clean slate: new company, fresh cap table, and funds dedicated to the new product. Call it emotional attachment, loyalty or ignoring the notion of sunk cost, founders will often honor continuity and momentum even if it means less than ideal capitalistic terms. VCs should probably acknowledge that and recognize that a pivot done right deserves a little readjustment or nudge towards the effort. Reversely, when comes the time to pivot, founders should perhaps approach their investors in earnest and plead towards a new set of terms and incentive: relution against cash if pivot succeeds, dilution otherwise.In reality, entrepreneurs keep at it and pivot within the capitalistic framework inherited from the pre-pivot period. To that effect, I only have one piece of advice: raise more funds if you can by adding some padding to your budget. In short, within your fundraising round, provision for a pivot by allocating an extra 50% of your initial budget. Early stage investors (seed or series A) will be more interested to discuss this notion of padding for a potential pivot rather than discuss unrealistic 3 year projections.Pivoting is in fact a corollary to the Entrepreneur and innovator, executive, board level advisor, angel investor, speaker.

By Laurence McCahill, Not just an opportunity to decelerate, but Well it was a test to see whether my startup — Alpselerator was created with the aim of accelerating purposeful ideas, making new friendships, deepening existing ones and getting exposed to a ton of great conversations, inspiration, and fun, over a week in the French Alps.And if this were to be a success could it become something bigger? A dream accelerator in the mountains where people from all over the world come to bring their dreams to life with others. And not just selfish dreams, but Dreams to make our lives, and the lives of others, a little better.Sweet dreams. Connected dreams.You see Alpselerator and Alptitude both took place in When you’re looking at a vast mountain, your perspective shifts.No time to sweat the small stuff, this is where big decisions get made.Well…code got written, books got launched, websites got made, posts got written, videos were filmed, plans were hatched, roles were agreed, knowledge was shared, tips were exchanged, marathons were run (no, really) and cheese got eaten.And when I say cheese I mean LOTS of cheese.There were moments of quiet and moments of activity, periods of deceleration as well as bursts of acceleration. We got in flow, tuning in to each others needs and energies. We were thinking (and being) The week had no structure. And I mean, And work it out we did.By day 2 we’d developed a rhythm. People worked on their own projects, but they helped each other. People focused, but they opened themselves up to serendipity.We had a long Trello board of things we wanted to do by the week’s end. And over the first day or so we started to work our way through them.But then it soon dawned on myself and Which made us question why were we So we quickly accepted that we wouldn’t get everything on our list done. And in fact, as it turned out, the list might have been the This week wasn’t about checking off to-do items from a Trello board. It was about making the right decisions, working on the right thing. Hanging out with likeminded people and absorbing as much knowledge from those in the room. Constantly checking in with ourselves to ensure we were making the most of this opportunity to learn, share and connect.We achieved a We’ve been able to think bigger.But most of all, we learnt a lot. There were a ton of small things we learnt such as tools we can use or people we should speak to, but I’d summarise the big learnings into the following:If you like the sound of a new way of doing business that doesn’t revolve around grey suited moodhoovers and office cubicles, then If you like it please share using the hashtags #officenotrequired #remoteworkThe Alpselerator teams were, in no particular order:Also thanks to Sparkly optimist and man on a mission to spread entrepreneurial happiness.

Failure sucks. You may have heard of the famous startup maths: nine of out 10 startups fail. The bitter truth about failure hurts but the most important thing is that most entrepreneurs move on to do something else. It’s not over until you give up. There are a ton of startups trying to make it, and a lot of them just don’t make the cut. Whether it’s poor budgeting, lack of excitement, or bad management, the onus is on the founders to explain what really happened. The good news for aspiring entrepreneurs is that, some founders open up about their failures and share their experiences with the public without hesitation.I have rounded up over 50 startups that failed and the reasons why they failed to make it. The reasons for their failure were shared by the founders and those close to management in various startup post-mortems online.Featured failed startups;1.

When Twitter went public in 2013, it was given a 24 billion dollar valuation — 12 times higher than the New York Times.Yet, both companies employed thousands of people. And both companies distributed news to millions of people. Even further, the New York Times earned $133M in 2012 while Twitter lost money.How could this be?The answer is cash flow. Business valuations are based on a company’s earning potential The value of a business today is how much money it will make in the future.From an economic perspective, the value of each person The further into the future — or more durable — your game plan: the greater the value of your cause.Unfortunately, most people — when planning a business or anything else in life — rarely consider the value of their endeavor 10–15 years down the road. In our radically accelerating lives, it can feel impossible to plan more than a year or two ahead.And this is exactly the dogma we’re being taught by the business “gurus.” React and respond to the market. Focus on quick growth. Don’t have a plan.Of this, Billionaire Peter Thiel writes in his book, “The buzzwords of the moment call for building a ‘lean startup’ that can ‘adapt’ and ‘evolve’ to an ever-changing environment. Would-be entrepreneurs are told that nothing can be known in advance: we’re supposed to listen to what customers say they want, make nothing more than a ‘minimum viable product,’ and iterate our way to success. But leanness is a methodology, not a goal. Iteration without a bold plan won’t take you from zero to one.”According to Thiel, innovation does not happen by reacting to culture, movements, or societal expectations for how you should act. Rather, it occurs as people challenge these reflections of the status quo.As Mark Twain has said, “Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.”Rather than pursuing what’s trendy or what’s been successful for other people, the best thing you can do is think for yourself. That may also be the most difficult thing to do.In order to think for yourself, you need to leave the idea of competition behind. Although we’ve been taught our whole lives that competition leads to success, in the real world it’s detrimental. It disrupts intrinsic motivation and leads to narrow-sightedness.In the book, Far fewer companies have a culture of collaboration Yet, according to Logan, there are those magical instances, when an organization leaves competition altogether. They enter a universe of their own with limitless possibilities. They set the terms of the market because no one else can do what they do. The gap between themselves and anyone else continuously widens with no projection of that changing in the foreseeable future.Are you merely copying the strategies of other people?Are you responding as quickly as you can to the market?How will you measure your own life?What is it you really want to do?In life and in business, a person’s value is what they are worth in the future — in the long-term. Anyone can be cool for a day. Where will you be in 10 years?Is the path you’re on a response to yesterday’s market? If it is, how will you know where you’re going to be in 10 years?Or, is the path you’re on part of a grand plan you’ve devised and are committed to? As Seth Godin has said in Thank you for reading.

La première étape que vise une startup, c’est le product / market fit. C’est un peu le graal de l’entrepreneur, le moment où l’on sent que “ça pique un peu” et que les gens s’intéressent à votre produit. Pourtant, on est facilement désespéré à force de coups d’épée dans l’eau et de silence radio de la part de ces consommateurs qu’on fantasme tant.Comment remédier à cette incertitude ? Tout simplement en testant, et en testant vite. Il faut tester un maximum d’idées et de propositions de valeur pour prétendre connaître un marché : votre source d’inspiration ne doit pas être le dernier rapport de McKinsey mais votre dashboard Google Analytics ! Fort heureusement, il existe pléthore d’outils pour tester ses idées très rapidement.Commençons par un court point vocabulaire : MVP signifie minimum viable product, soit le produit minimum viable. Il y a deux manière de se lancer : s’enfermer dans une cave pendant 3 ans et fabriquer le produit comme on se l’imagine ou tester la réaction du marché à son idée, parler avec ceux qui se sont montrés intéressés, développer un produit simple, re-tester et itérer jusqu’à devenir Facebook. Autant vous dire que la deuxième solution est préférable.On doit à Eric Ries la popularité de schéma de pensée ainsi que celle du terme de MVP. Car dans ce processus, plutôt que de commencer avec un produit fini qui offre toutes les fonctionnalités imaginables et possibles dès le départ, on commence avec une fonction, une hypothèse simple à tester.Le MVP n’est pas un produit baclé ou bancale mais une fonction, LA fonction essentielle, codée de manière incroyable. Le MVP d’une voiture ne serait pas un chassis avec une carosserie en papier mais le meilleur skateboard du monde.Oui, mais si le produit est compliqué ? On peut tricher un peu pour mesurer la réponse d’un marché. Le meilleur exemple est Dropbox : Dropbox coûte cher à développer, même en version ultra-simplifiée. Solution : faire une fausse vidéo avec un champs email en dessous et mesurer le taux de conversion de la landing page. Faire un MVP, même sans coder, c’est tout à fait faisable. Et si vous codez, ces services peuvent malgré tout vous être utiles.Launchrock vous permet de faire une chose et une seule : lancer un produit. En 3 minutes, vous pouvez assembler une page qui collecte les emails avec un petit texte et une belle image.Pour aller plus loin, découvrez Strikingly, un service qui vous permet de créer une page un peu plus complète, composée de diverses sections faisant la part belle aux images et aux grandes typos. Vous pouvez même le connecter à Unbounce est un service un peu plus compliqué que les deux précédents mais il vous permet de tester plusieurs landing complètement différentes. Ca prend un peu plus de temps à maîtriser mais peut être très puissant pour tester aussi bien le texte que les visuelsOlark peut fonctionner avec tous les services sus-mentionnés et permet d’interagir avec les visiteurs du site en live-chat. Si quelqu’un a une question, il peut non seulement la poser mais vous pouvez vous-même déclencher le chat. Cela est très utile pour discuter avec vos clients !Au delà de la technique pure, ce qui fait une landing efficace, ce sont aussi les visuels que vous y mettez. Soyez attentifs à choisir un ensemble d’illustrations qui corresponde à votre marque !Si vous étiez un film, qui seriez-vous ? Cherchez sur Google des images, voire des séquences vidéos que vous pourriez assembler pour créer un ensemble marquant. Et regardez aussi du côté de réseaux tels que Pour aller plus loin, Niels et Benjamin ont fait un super cours sur ces sujets : Normalement, avec tout cela, vous devriez arrêter tout de suite de vous tourner les pouces et commencer à construire une page. Commencez par la faire tourner autour de vous, en harcelant vos amis pour qu’ils diffusent. Mesurez la réponses, parlez aux utilisateurs et itérez.Puis, diffusez-le partout. L’exemple de Dropbox est intéressant : il a suffi de quelques heures sur Hacker News pour bâtir une très grosse liste de prospects.

I’m very proud to share with you that after 11 months in beta version, Aircall’s path is not the typical “startup success story” that you might read about on TechCrunch. It didn’t raise millions on a hunch and got hundreds of thousands of users right from the start. Yet, if you’re an entrepreneur yourself, you know that those success stories reflect just to opposite of your daily, hard-working life.AircallI am particularly proud of this project who had to face Aircall was built inside eFounders’ startup studio. By nature, it means it got much more means and resources than any other startups. We bring a team of expert, an infrastructure of tools, and some money on the table right from the start. Does this mean that it’s become “easy” to build a startup? Absolutely not.During the same period, the team built a fully functional app with collaboration features, CRM integration and an ultra-user friendly UX.The market we address is huge (around $40 B) and we are pioneers. Being pioneers can simply not be easy, it requires people to change their habits (shifting a phone system to the cloud, embracing phone support as a scalable channel) and getting the word spread.While we were building Aircall, similar products launched: these were a sign that we were on the right path.The Aircall team has gained an immense amount of experience during this beta version. Their free trial got hacked. Strong competitors arose. They lost great clients. Some of their teammates left. Finally, I’d like to thank the great investors that believed in Aircall to skyrocket, we all share the same vision to change how businesses speak with their customers.Try Aircall now on More info on their launch is the Founder Together with entrepreneurs, we turn unique ideas into successful companies.

Listen up all you digital natives. Put away your smartphones and grab your scissors and glue — we’re going old school! I’m going to let you in on a little FinTech secret, one that might just make you unicorn-tastic super rich! There’s a formula for generating FinTech startup ideas and it’s very simple. I’ve distilled it down to 3 dodeca-dice…So that’s it! You now have in your possesion the ability to generate 1700+ FinTech startups ideas. Use this power wisely, be careful who you share this with and if you do become Scrooge McDuck-level super rich be sure to buy me a beer🍺.There’s a serious point to all this. Much has been written recently about a FinTech bubble ripe for bursting and here’s why I don’t believe this will happen any time soon. Financial Services is a big enough pie and there are enough disruptive “throws of the dice” to keep FinTech buoyant for at least a couple more years!CEO  Co-founder 

If you put in an effort and pull your weight, you can influence whether or not the company succeeds. As long as you speak up, the ideas that you have carry much more weight than if you were to work at a larger company. I can’t emphasize this enough; You also get to see the impact of your projects, rather than being a small part of a much larger puzzle. By directly influencing projects and taking on responsibility, you work towards something more important than just getting work done for the sake of getting work done. Plenty of enterprise establishments have internships in order to fill the funnel for job openings. That is all well and good, but it means that there isn’t always work that needs to be done. At a startup, you won’t need to wait around for someone to assign you busy work. In a startup environment, you can always ask to be involved in interdepartmental projects that will help expand your knowledge of both the product and business. Coming out of college you have no real work-related skill-sets anyway so why not start in an environment that encourages learning newer tools and software? With the growth of BYOA (Bring your own apps) and BYOT (Bring your own tools) in startups, you aren’t limited to learning software that you don’t want or need. You will likely be put in a role where you get to run your own projects and manage employees. If you’re more of a lone wolf, you will be given more autonomy and responsibility in your projects.An internship can also give you insight into the long term viability of the company and whether or not you should search elsewhere for a full-time job. If things don’t look pretty, you always have time to apply to more stable jobs.USC Trojan, Physics Nerd, BI @ Bitium, Growth We are a global tribe creating the startup community we’ve always wanted.

This upcoming November marks the two-year anniversary when I asked my best friend, a relentless entrepreneur, to join him in building an idea he’d been developing for three years. Due to a platform that will inevitably change the education industry and crazy-intelligent employees, the idea bloomed into a brilliant startup.Last month, amidst rocket growth, I quit.I left the Marketing Director role without a secure plan in place. No job offers, no life plan, no destination city or detailed pursuit. All I was armed with: gallons of self-awareness, curiosity, and a willingness to experiment with different versions of life.I faced uncharted emotions as I turned away from the only path I had ever considered. My vision had pointed, for 22 years, towards holding a well-paying career that supported a life I wanted to live. With this dream came the “sexy” ideas of work/life balance, six-figure salaries, weekend adventures, and early retirements.The moment I left college, my clenched assumptions crumbled. Out of the rubble emerged self-awareness.I moved beyond skimming textbooks and filled my mind with thought-provoking novels. I began to dissect the tactics of visionaries and dreamers who spoke to the unrecognized fire in my belly. I sought friends and mentors who demanded the full version of my mind. As my understanding of self evolved, my eyes opened. I saw the infinite possibilities of what it looks like when one lives authentically in the direction of their personal mission.When my perspective cleared, I noticed a lack of vibrancy within myself. My role in the startup allowed for remote work, flexible vacation days, working with my best friend, and hefty amounts of potential monetary gain. But after 22 months of the enticing benefits, I failed to greet each day with joy.There are thousands of stories about humans who quit their job to follow their passion. What is rarely mentioned are those who stay because they have yet to receive their calling. In my case, I know specific answers to what caused a lack of strength in my spirit, but I only possess vague ideas of what I want to call my lifework. Although I hold no compass telling me where my next step will land, I know I will not find the coordinates to my mission standing still.The lack of knowledge of what one loves, appears to be universal in those around me. They, including myself, sit in jobs that are “logical” and “what you have to do to be successful”. However, in my limited life experience, success rarely occurs through logic. More often, it’s unearthed after finding happiness; a personal pursuit rarely straightforward.I understand the paralyzing fear of not having answers to the questions of “what are you going to do with your life?” Trust me, my family and friends often ask me looking for comforting answers. But, I would rather feel the fear of life’s unknowns and pursue happiness, than sit in regret clutching embryonic aspirations.Conditioned to believe dreams are what one majors in, I now have to confront the reality that my dreams are still undefined. Maybe my future lies in composing, volunteering, extreme sports, or maybe in building my own startup.The only way to achieve concrete answers to these questions is through intentional experimentation. And that is exactly what I plan on doing.Logan Stoneman is a writer, backpacker, minimalist, full-time traveler, and the creator of You can read more of his words on his blog and by following him on Writer || Marketing Entrepreneur || Full-Time Adventurer || Essays at LogStone.coHere there is hope, humor, and help as you deepen your connection to others, yourself, and to your work.

N ous vivons une époque formidable.C’est aussi ce que je me suis dit un beau matin en 2010, quand nous avons décidé de monter avec mon associé notre projet de réseau social professionnel, Welcome to the “Fail Academy”.Le web repose par définition sur du code.Quand nous avons débuté Digikaa, nous avons pris la décision de travailler avec un studio de développement externe, qui proposait un framework propriétaire, avec des fonctionnalités idéales pour notre projet. Une solution attrayante pour minimiser les coûts en début de projet, mais qui s’est vite avérée être une mauvaise idée, et ceci pour deux raisons :Au sein de l’incubateur où nous étions, nous avons pu suivre l’évolution de différentes start ups comme En conclusion, si je devais remonter une start up digitale aujourd’hui, j’intègrerais dès le début un CTO (qui est clairement un des profils les plus difficiles à trouver actuellement ☺).La course à la bonne idée n’est pas une chose aisée : il faut savoir lâcher du lest sur son instinct de départ et faire confiance aux datas et aux retours utilisateurs. Et surtout, il faut se concentrer sur le service minimum viable, qui va pouvoir répondre à un vrai besoin utilisateur et donc générer du chiffre d’affaire tout au long de l’évolution du projet, afin de passer les différentes étapes qui mèneront à la Big Idea.Le visuel ci-dessous illustre parfaitement à mes yeux la problématique du service minimum viable :C’est à mon sens un des écueils du projet Digikaa : nous avions une vision très long terme du produit final (un réseau social spécialisé), mais qui ne pouvait être viable que si tout le marché était présent dessus : Un objectif atteignable qu’après de nombreux mois et années, période pendant laquelle il était très difficile de convaincre nos potentiels clients. Il aurait donc fallu se concentrer sur des services incontournables, les réaliser à la perfection pour attirer un maximum de profils, pour ensuite peut-être mettre en place le réseau social. Un site comme Autre point concernant le service minimum viable, nous avions la fâcheuse tendance à nous éparpiller sur un grand nombre d’actions différentes, ce qui demandait beaucoup d’énergie, et bien souvent de l’argent. C’est ainsi que nous avons créé les Digikaapéros, un rdv mensuel de rencontres entre les professionnels du digital, persuadés que cela permettrait de mieux fédérer la communauté sur le réseau par la suite. Nous avons aussi organisé de nombreuses animations pour tous les membres afin qu’ils aient le sentiment d’appartenance à un groupe vivante et dynamique. Mais, encore une fois, toutes ces actions étaient vaines, tant que le service minimum viable et générateur de chiffre d’affaire n’étaient pas mis en place.Enfin, lorsque nous avons pensé Digikaa, nous avons pensé utilisateur. C’était d’ailleurs notre obsession. Mais l’erreur a été de ne pas penser client. Nous avons tout fait pour que le professionnel du web puisse s’inscrire facilement, naviguer, déposer de la data pour valoriser son profil, mais nous avons trop mis de côté le client et son expérience, pensant que cela viendrait en temps deux, quand le réseau se serait étoffé. Malheureusement, nous n’avions pas ce service minimum viable pour les utilisateurs, et comme vu en 1/, nous n’avions pas la structure technique pour nous permettre de pivoter ou de modifier le service afin de mieux répondre aux besoins des clients.Notre potentielle clientèle visée était les RH, et autres cabinets spécialisés en recrutement. Or, cette cible n’était pas encore massivement au fait des nouveaux usages du digital, et découvrait tout juste Linked In, sur lequel elle pouvait trouver tous les profils du marché. Nous avions donc trop anticipé un usage auprès d’une cible qui n’était pas réceptive, ce qui fait que nous avons eu beaucoup de mal à convaincre nos potentiels clients.Beaucoup de personnes, dont Autre point important, ne pas succomber à la folie des grandeurs. Nous avons très vite grandi, jusqu’à 7 personnes, pour couvrir les différentes activités que nous avions mis en place. Stages, CDD, autant de frais fixes très importants qu’il fallait payer, et qui nous mettait une grande pression quant à l’argent qu’il fallait rentrer dans les caisses de l’entreprise tous les mois.Pour cela, en plus de quelques emprunts (PCE, Oseo), nous avions une activité parallèle à celle du réseau Digikaa : Un élément essentiel qui permet de rester motivé dans les premiers mois du projet est ce que j’appelle la foi. La foi en son idée, la foi en son ou ses associés, la foi en son rôle d’entrepreneur. Dès que la foi s’amenuise, l’énergie de se lever le matin diminue, et il devient très vite usant de toujours se battre pour expliquer une énième fois son projet.Certains veulent être entrepreneur pour changer le monde, d’autres simplement pour ne pas avoir de boss au-dessus d’eux. Pour ma part, je pense avoir été super excité à l’idée de créer quelque chose, un projet, un site. Mais la création n’est finalement qu’un tout petit bout de l’aventure : une fois cette étape terminée, c’est une toute autre histoire qui commence, celle de la commercialisation, de la gestion, de la comptabilité… Autant de sujets qui prennent une part importante dans le bon déroulement de la vie d’une jeune entreprise, mais qui ne sont forcément très excitantes au quotidien.Le projet Digikaa est actuellement en cours de fermeture. Une aventure de trois ans, où je suis passé par toutes les phases entre excitation et dépression. C’est un apprentissage professionnel, personnel, où l’on explore ses limites, on apprend à mieux se connaître, et surtout, on apprend de ses erreurs. Si je devais remonter une entreprise aujourd’hui, je serais riche de toutes ces mauvaises décisions, et j’éviterais de prendre les mêmes. Cela dit, la création d’un business est loin d’être une science exacte, et il y a tellement de paramètres à manipuler qu’une seule expérience ne permet pas d’être à l’abri d’un nouvel échec.Il faut créer de nouvelles entreprises, c’est important d’explorer de nouvelles façon de faire. Aujourd’hui, j’aide volontiers les amis qui veulent se lancer, en leur faisant part de ma petite expérience. L’époque dans laquelle nous vivons est extraordinaire pour tous ceux qui veulent changer le monde, alors allez-y ! Mais avant, n’hésitez pas à interroger d’anciens apprentis entrepreneurs pour éviter, dès le début, de prendre les mauvaises décisions.French digital optimist  UX Design activist — Video games  Music lover.

+BONUS: Announcing the first 2 hardware investments at Point Nine Cap!Historically, innovation tends to happen in waves:As an investor, our job is to try to find which companies can define the next wave of innovation — and make sure we invest in them!Today: SaaS is sexy again? Fintech? Mobile? Big data? … It’s not clear which one will make the next $100bn business.If you compare hardware to software, you will get why it is “hard”:In software the most relevant costs of delivering your product come from servers and third party services. In hardware, you need to take into account that a big chunk of the final price goes to paying the producers, the transportation companies and the distributors of the product.In hardware investments, extra patience is required: it not only takes time and money to build a product, it also takes upfront investment to get the product into distribution channels — you need to invest money to deliver the products to the retailers, who at the same time will pay you with +30 days delay.For those reasons, among others, you might be able to understand why VCs have been avoiding hardware investments and focusing their efforts on purely software startups.While software is eating the world, we (still) spend most of our life interacting with the real and physical world.Smartphones aside, the physical world is still a lot less smart and connected than the online one, which means, plenty of opportunities for innovation!Entrepreneurs and capital are now jumping into hardware at an So far, the early successes in hardware have been on the consumer front. But individual consumers are very unpredictable when they buy for themselves, while business customers tend to be a lot more “Hardware is already complicated enough on its own to add the unpredictable behaviour of consumers. At Point Nine we have an easier time understanding B2B models and we have been investing very early in great SaaS companies. When we started looking at hardware, we tried to find opportunities where the dynamics we understand in SaaS also apply, including:We not only believe in these opportunities, but we are putting our money where our mouth is. In the last weeks, two of the first hardware investments of Point Nine were announced — in alphabetical order:We’re very impressed by Jens and his team — together, they have built an elegantly simple and API-first solution to manage a fleet of vehicles.The opportunity is clear: cars and trucks are an integral part of the transportation infrastructure, automile’s product is amazing and the team is unique!Bernhard-ware and the team have built a solution that allows companies to control access to their buildings with a device we always carry: our smartphones! Of course, the system also provides APIs which allow you to generate virtual keys, with an expiration date, on the fly.We followed the same criteria we use to evaluate other investments:a) b) c) In summary, all three aspects are the result of extremely talented teams that have managed to build a commercial product in a very lean way.Investor in Startups Stories from the Point9 team  portfolio companies

The vast majority of successful startups have 2–4 founders, and not just for kicks. Co-founders keep you accountable in the void of structure that is creating a startup. They’ll help you stay on track instead of getting wrapped up in minor decisions, like what color your homepage should be. Plus, the right co-founder will provide much needed moral support as you careen along the roller coaster of startup life.Not only is a good co-founder important from a personal perspective, it’s something investors look for. Co-founders prove that your idea is engaging enough for others to get behind. It also gives your company better brainpower. If you partner with someone who has a skill set complementary to your own (which you should always do to avoid org chart overlap), you’ll be able to make more thoroughly thought-out decisions.So now that you know why you need a co-founder, where do you start? While it might seem like a sound idea to start a company with your best friend, sibling, or that brilliant engineer you recently met, doing so could easy turn into an entrepreneurial horror story. I’ve seen it happen to friends — and to myself. Over time, I’ve learned what to look for in co-founders, and below is the time-tested recipe for business partner bliss.Begin with logistics. Each founder should have a year’s worth of cash saved up. This will let them focus on the startup without being distracted by financial woes, even if cutting down salaries becomes a necessity. You also need people who are hands-down ready to quit their current jobs. The early years of startups are tough, and you need a team that’s ready for adventure and 100% behind the vision you’re pursuing.Not only do your co-founders need to get behind your product, they need to believe in you as a leader. Ego is dangerous, both for your and your co-founders. Pick partners who are confident, yet humble. If your co-founders get upset when you take the lead or can’t accept mistakes and criticism, you’ll find yourself in migraine territory faster than you run to the drugstore for Advil.Ideally, your co-founders will be people you’ve successfully worked with before. There’s no better way to be sure of a person’s work ethic and personality than to have already seen them in action. Plus, the years you’ve spent building a relationship will play an important role. Startups do to co-founder relationships what puppies do to socks; they try to pull them apart. Having a tightly woven friendship will keep your startup from fraying at the seams.This doesn’t mean that starting a company with your best friend equals instant success. You need to make sure your co-founders are persistent. Startups never stop delivering surprises. Big contracts get dropped last minute, and profit doesn’t always roll in when you expect it to. You need co-founders who are ready to try and try again. When the founders of Not sold on how important determination is? Take it from This isn’t to say that all forms of tenacity are terrific, though. Make sure your co-founders aren’t so blinded by their vision, they forget to be flexible. The unpredictability of startups require superhuman adaption skills. Choose co-founders who can switch directions in the blink of an eye and all obstacles will instantly be that much easier to conquer.Another thing that helps overcome obstacles is imagination. Of course intelligence is important, but the ability to think creatively often trumps book smarts. Pick co-founders who don’t just think outside the box, but actively try to obliterate it. If you and your co-founders can feed off each other’s unusual ideas, you’re more likely to strike upon solutions others haven’t thought of. Any novel idea that’s easy to think of has already been tried. The unexpected will help set your company apart.These unusual ideas won’t always be comfortable, so look for co-founders who like to make a bit of mischief. But let’s be clear: you want teammates who delight in breaking rules — but only the right ones. They must have integrity alongside audacity. Achieving greatness without taking calculated risks is like starting a fire with wet matches — pretty much impossible.There you have it, the most important qualities to look for in a cofounder. Let’s recap these qualities to give you a good, high-level look at what to keep in mind.Each founder might find they have slightly different requirements of their co-founders, but the qualities covered remain a constant. The road ahead for your startup will undoubtedly have challenges, but if you vet your co-founders by the qualities covered here, dealing with company-killing business partners won’t be one of them.They call me ‘The Wolf’.

There is no doubt that Korea is in a revolutionary moment. In my last post, “The Korean War (1950–1953) left the country in a state of utter disorder. The bustling metropolis we reside in today was but a dream when basic running water was a luxury. In a matter of 60 years though, South Korea has transitioned from a country receiving international aid to now being a significant donor to the global community.The forefathers of Korea developed the nation into an economic powerhouse with an unrelenting fortitude and audacious vision. Now a new generation of pioneers have taken the reigns and have begun to shape Korea’s destiny with a millennial swag anchored by traditional roots.Why will they succeed? What is it about Korea that makes it poised for entrepreneurial success?There are 3 hallmark pillars that will define this new rising tide of startups in Korea:The level of home grown talent in Korea is at a historical high. I don’t believe Korea has ever had a more educated and globally minded generation in it’s history. Korean millennials (born between the early 1980s to the early 2000s) are hyper connected, bi-lingual, and carry a level of discipline strengthened by years of rigorous academic devotion.A staggering 98% of Korean students graduated from either a college, university or graduate institution; the If there was one single contributor to Korea’s meteoric rise in a single generation, the guiding light was their devotion to education. According to the Korean Ministry of Education, South Koreans spent nearly $20 billion on private tuition. Their dedication to education is real and the results are nothing short of perfection. South Korea Currently, the United States spends more than other developed nations on its students’ education, but it’s students Silicon Valley executives — namely the late Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg — have repeatedly An early generational investment towards math and science education has left the country with a matrix of highly skilled developers. With a keen sense of global cool, engineers in Korea are poised to define and construct the next big thing. Toss in a beautifully volatile dose of creativity onto this stockpile of talent and the results will be brilliantly combustible.Having grown up in the Bay Area all my life, and living the last 8 in San Francisco, I thought I knew what a hyper connected modern city looked like. That is, until I moved to Seoul.Labeled as the “Tech Capital” of the world, San Francisco boasts itself as a cutting edge city where the future isn’t just being built but experienced. This 7x7 mecca is stunning and it’s magnetic draw for pulling in global entrepreneurs is unmatched, but the differences in infrastructure are glaring. When it comes to digital connection and public transportation; two necessities for a modern economy to thrive, Seoul leads the way.South Korea is the most connected country in the world with 95% of the country covered in wi-fi. Not Seoul, the country. With average wireless speeds at 300 megabits per second, citizens can download an 800-megabyte movie on their phone or tablet in just 22 seconds. Further, the Korean government is wiring every household with 1 gigabit-per second connection — which would make it two hundred times faster than the average Internet connection in the United States. Korea is the undisputed global leader when it comes to broadband speed.Contrast this with San Francisco, where the Mayor and city supervisors enthusiastically celebrate the passage of a major milestone when In Seoul even the labyrinth of underground subway systems are mobile paradises. Wireless broadband antennas (WiBro)are spread out at 300 to 400 meter intervals in the tunnels and stations offering 4 megabits per second. Further, every subway car has 2 wi-fi hotspots so connectivity is never lost. Hundreds of thousands of riders can simultaneously stream tv shows, movies, baseball games, etc. 50–100 feet below ground or water without a glitch. In the Bay Area attempting to watch a YouTube video on MUNI, Bart, Caltrain or on one of the many tech shuttle buses without buffering is hit or miss.But why is this hyper connectivity important? The world has moved mobile; 80 million mobile phone users in 1995 to a whopping South Korea has the 4th highest smartphone penetration rate globally. Nearly 4 out of 5 people in Korea own a smartphone so when applications catch fire here they explode in popularity with fellow Asian countries catching note. This intelligent technical infrastructure will allow for quick consumer consumption of new services and offer a direct pipeline to neighboring Asian countries.Internet speeds alone won’t be the game changing factor for the success of Korean startups, but having a paved highway over a dirt road certainly doesn’t hurt. This digital infrastructure will allow entrepreneurs to innovate and distribute new tools to the masses at high voltage.Elon Musk dreams of a hyper loop. The broadband version exists: Korea.I was late. Not because I had overslept or because I didn’t leave early enough. I was late because my bus made a normal right turn. My bus lost the battle to it’s daily nemesis, the street.The MUNI driver fumbled on his leather gloves as he grudgingly stumbled out of the bus. The power cable connecting the bus to it’s track had become disconnected. A sigh swept over the bus as passengers bore down into their cell phones with a rising annoyance. Sadly this wasn’t the first time they had experienced this. Staring out the back window, watching the bus driver play ‘Cities need efficient arteries to properly move the economy. Highways, transportation systems and passageways need to be cleared of city plaque to allow for the free movement of economic cells. When this flow is blocked, the heart of the city fails to feed off it’s human energy and simply collapses. Sadly there is no app that can magically fix this. It’s a concerted city effort to quickly diagnose and maintain a healthy city body for continued growth. What good is an on-demand economy if nothing can be on demand?Seoul has been dubbed “the city of the future”, but I would argue it’s simply a city utilizing modern day achievements at maximum potential. New York and San Francisco could have broadband wi-fi blanket the city but they don’t. LA could have a modern and clean public transportation system but they don’t. The US could have more universities than prisons but These technologies and most importantly the knowledge of modern city development is not relegated to just Korea. Seoul has simply done what other cities should naturally do. Develop with the cities’ future in mind, not that of a minority political clog. The entrepreneurial arteries are clean, the flow of information accelerates forward, and the runway for growth is lined up.Tears began to fill her eyes; a well of sorrow. As a young girl, she had always dreamed about her wedding. A surreal day celebrating with friends and family. A defining moment in her life. She had cherished the ring her husband had bestowed upon her that day; recollecting the warmth of his palm. More than a symbol of their love, it was a token of their future. Happiness. Dreams. Today, hands trembling from the cold of anguish, she was donating this treasure to her country.The 1997 Then, something happened. An absolutely extraordinary sight.South Koreans began to queue in line for hours to donate their most cherished possessions; couples donated gold wedding rings, athletes contributed medals and trophies, and shop owners handed over precious gold “luck” keys (a traditional present on the opening of a new business or a 60th birthday). Within a week of this gold drive nearly 8 metric tons were privately donated. This incredible sacrifice was done as a grassroots gesture of support for their beleaguered economy and to replenish the national treasury.Four years later, 3 years ahead of schedule, South Korea repaid the entire loan. The IMF Crisis gave us a glaring glimpse of the backbone of this nation. Economists have cited South Korea as an exemplary nation when discussing solutions for Europe’s current debt crisis (Greece). When boxed into a corner, the people of Korea fight. They don’t limp into a hand; they go all-in.When one reflects upon the Korean people, there is a lineage of two traits that have been instrumental for the development of their entrepreneurial soul: Unity for a common goal and deepMore so than investment capital, startup incubators, unicorn ideas, or rockstar venture capitalists, startup ecosystems thrive off of a rebellious belief that “I will not surrender.” When one peers into the hearts of Silicon Valley successes, the common thread that links them all is a never-die attitude. Entrepreneurs like Startups are glorious engines for economic growth, but success rarely comes easy. Long nights, hopeless moments, and frustrating problems litter the road to glory. The enduring variable for success is never the idea, money or even high speed internet. It’s downright grit, and the ability to truly sacrifice your comforts for a larger vision. How much are you willing to give up for the greater goal? Koreans have proven time and time again, that their entrepreneurial soul was ingrained with the habit of selfless sacrifice for the true win.Some of Korea’s most lucrative global successes were shockingly born from the somber IMF Crisis period. There’s nothing half-assed about Korean entrepreneurs, and their formidable work ethic based on *****In my next piece I will explore, what I believe to be, the most important factor for Korea to endure. Not just within the startup space but as a country. While all signs say ‘Go!’ for Korea, this one single element may cripple the future for this nation.

2012. We had our first Skype call at around 04:00 a.m. IST. Vinny was from Auckland, New Zealand. I was based out of Gaya (mostly known by a city near to Bodhgaya where Buddha attained enlightenment), Bihar, India.We had never met, in person before that. We did participate in In our hour long discussion on what we want to do together, we could only decide on one word — DATA. We were both interested in building a For next few months, over several cups of coffee, we discussed all the possibilities —creating a data analytic company, analysing social media data, and even data sciences.This whole discussion transformed into something concrete, when we realised that even the basics of creating data is broken.We consume a lot of data every day. (The same is not true, when you wish to create data. Most of the platforms are very specific. There are only 3 major type of platforms available for you to create data:Pause at this moment, and look into your phones now.

For the first time ever, many investors have access to a whole new class of asset available to invest in. A lot of people have wanted to invest in startups but haven’t had the expertise, access to deal flow, or enough capital to get included in a funding round. Now there’s a way to access some of the hottest deals in the world of startups with comparatively smaller amounts than ever before. To balance risk, one can invest in many companies and attempt to win or lose with the entire ecosystem, not just an individual company.With AngelList’s great new Syndicates program, So how does one go about choosing which angels to back? If you regularly follow the startup scene, you’re most likely familiar with some of the larger than life personalities on the list. Basically, you’ll want to trust your lead, and feel that they have access to more deal flow than a regular AngelList user. You should also trust their judgement and opinions, which is essential because they may be the ones sitting on the board, helping to guide the company you’ve just invested in. I’ve been through the startup process, and trust me, the board is key. You should do some research into their past successes or investment strategy to see if you feel comfortable with their style and the choices they’ve previously made. A true index fund would invest in every single qualified startup available but most individuals don’t have access to that much capital. Finally, there’s an open question about whether or not market forces are an indication of success in this new world of Syndicates. Do other AngelList investors know something you don’t? Are the Syndicate leads with the most backing the most qualified? Time will tell…Silicon Valley is where all the action happens. An overwhelming majority of great startup success stories happen here, and these are some of the guys that seem to be in the middle of the madness.Expected deals per year: 5, Minimum Investment: $10K min per dealNaval, the CEO of AngelList is the most natural place to start with Syndicates. He would be my first choice, but the point of an index fund would be to invest in as many credible deals as possible and he has a minimum of $10,000 per deal. I have no doubt these will be of the highest quality, but it would limit the scope of the fund. Unless you plan on investing over $100,000 per year into this concept, I would recommend skipping Naval.Expected deals per year: 5, Minimum Investment: $1K min per dealWidely known as the founder of digg, his career has grown to include a great investment history. He’s currently a partner at Google Ventures and must be seeing great dealflow there. Kevin managed to invest in Twitter, Facebook, Square, AngelList, Zynga, etc. He’s currently the highest backed syndicate in the system. Interestingly enough, he’s the only one on the list that’s not taking any carry percentage. I highly recommend joining his group.Expected deals per year: 12, Minimum Investment: $1K min per dealDave’s worked at Facebook and Apple and is now the CEO of Path. At Path, he was rumored to have turned down $100M+ for his young startup. He’s got guts, experience and has access to great deals. He’s invested in Quora, Pinterest, Evernote, Nest, etc. I can’t wait to see what’s next.Expected deals per year: 4, Minimum Investment: $1K min per dealElad has a PhD from MIT, experience as a founder and has worked at both Google and Twitter. I hadn’t come across him before AngelList, but he definitely has the confidence of the market. He has a great investment history including Pinterest, Square, AirBnb and Stripe. He clearly states that there’s no penalty for skipping deals in his syndicate so there’s nothing to lose by joining in.As a SoCal resident, I’ve had the pleasure of meeting these fine gentleman and they’re all exceedingly brilliant. I believe that combined, they’ll see the best deals in the LA/OC area and each of them have unique takes on markets and sectors. There’s clearly no shortage of deals in the Valley, but I think there are some less competitive hidden gems out in Southern California.Expected deals per year: 5, Minimum Investment: $1K min per dealMike has a long history with startups and now runs a startup factory called Science Inc. out in Santa Monica. He’s been a founder and has carried a company through to an exit, and has also come in at the top as CEO of MySpace. I expect him to have a great eye for lifestyle companies and anything cool in the e-commerce space.Expected deals per year: 7, Minimum Investment: $1K min per dealJason’s a legend. He can be controversial, polarizing and outspoken but he definitely knows what he’s doing. He’s been in the game a long time and is always in close proximity to big success stories. His next startup, inside.com, is currently in stealth mode but has attracted all-star investors. He’s been charitable with his space and time out in Culver City so I’m banking on something interesting coming out of his group.Minimum Investment: $1K min per dealMark has been leading a new wave of VC transparency with his blog Note: His syndicate doesn’t seem very active, but hopefully he is interested and starts to do deals in 2014.Expected deals per year: 12, Minimum Investment: $1K min per dealThe CEO of Betaworks, John Borthwick has made some bold moves lately. Betaworks bought digg for $500K to leverage the brand into a new frontpage for the web. They put out a free iOS game, Dots, that proved to be simple and highly addictive. By now, they’ve demonstrated their formula of useful utility on a clean design and it works. Their investment portfolio includes Kickstarter, Tumblr and Twitter.In this article we’ve covered the ins and outs of AngelList Syndicates, and how they can be an effective, albeit risky, means of seeking a return in the startup arena. If you want to proceed, the first step is to apply to join a selection of syndicates. After acceptance, when a deal is announced, you should evaluate it for market segment, pre-money valuation, company stage and a few other factors. Remember, you should avoid investing in anything you don’t understand or are not completely comfortable with.Also, note that these types of investments have unusually long holding times. Any startup portfolio most likely won’t be fully liquid for 5-7 years. Of course there are options to sell private stock like SecondMarket, but traditionally investors hold equity until a liquidity event.Are we in the golden era of startups or are we in a bubble? Nobody knows, but I’m willing to bet that the party’s not quite over.If you would rather watch someone else play with their money instead, read on.On the finance side, I’ve been buying and selling stocks for over fifteen years. As for startups, I’ve built and sold one, and I’m currently on my For at least the next year, I plan on executing the strategy outlined above and test the portfolio theory behind the index fund as it relates to small tech companies. For the syndicates I’ve selected, there is an estimated 45 deals per year. Ideally, I’d love to invest in 25-30 of those if I can get the allocation.I’ll do my best to keep this completely transparent and will regularly post progress when there are updates available.

Se você é empreendedor, como eu, já deve ter visto e lido uma pancada de livros, artigos, vídeos, podcasts e deve ter ido à trocentos eventos sobre as chamadas Startups.Muitos livros e artigos são realmente inspiradores e despertam o melhor da gente (como o pessoal da Y Combinator e 500 Startups); Alguns vídeos com cases de empreendedores (como os Day 1 da Endeavor), fazem nosso sangue ferver e a gente fica empolgado em começar um negócio; E também tem aquelas palestras e workshops que dão os passos pra gente conseguir ter a tão sonhada Startup de Sucesso! Lindo né? Pena que tenho que te dizer que isto é tudo mentira.Eu também tenho uma Startup, e por 3 anos, participei de uma incubadora, de uma aceleradora, de vários programas de desenvolvimento de negócios, mentorias, contato com investidores, e conversei com uma porrada de outros empreendedores, que assim como eu, lutavam com unhas e dentes para conseguir que seu negócio decolasse. Neste tempo, aprendi algumas coisas importantes sobre empreender no mundo das Startups, e quero compartilhar com vocês um pouco do que vivi e aprendi.Talvez você que esteja lendo este artigo, faça parte da minha história, e talvez se sinta ofendido, ou ache que estou apenas falando bobagens porquê minha Startup não é um case de sucesso, que é inveja ou algo do tipo. Posso dizer de antemão que não é o caso. Talvez você esteja pensando em empreender, ou esteja empreendendo e não está entendendo o por quê as coisas simplesmente não dão certo. Espero poder te ajudar com isto, então, lá vai:1 — SEM GRANA PRA COMEÇAR? VAI DEMORAR2 — PODE SER QUE NADA DÊ CERTO3 — NÃO ACREDITE EM FÓRMULAS!4 — SUA STARTUP NÃO VAI SER IGUAL ÀS OUTRAS5 — NÃO EXISTE INVESTIDOR DE RISCO NO BRASIL6 — VAI SER DIFÍCIL ACHAR UMA EQUIPE COMPETENTE7 — SUA IDEIA NÃO É BOA O SUFICIENTEEu poderia citar outros tópicos por aqui, mas não quero que você desista, ao contrário, quero te incentivar a estudar, trabalhar e empreender cada vez mais! Vá a cursos, workshops palestras, veja vídeos, leia livros, escute podcasts, converse com outros empreendedores, procure mentores e não fique esperando pela boa vontade das pessoas, apenas faça!Pode ser que você pedale por muito tempo com uma ideia, duas, três, enfim, pode ser que você acerte apenas na décima ideia e que seu negócio não seja um Google da vida, mas você terá aprendido tanto, que tudo o que botar a mão vai ser um sucesso.Social, cultural and tropical entrepreneur.

I’ve been running ContractIQ as a bootstrapped company and it will soon be four years in that journey.For most parts, I have been a student and practitioner of the ‘art of bootstrapping’ a cash-flow positive, healthy EBITDA company that has a long runway. We are growing and if we chip harder and harder at it, that magic year is not too far off where the undiluted outcome is equal or better than a diluted outcome for a funded company’s founder.That is the premise and one of the promises of the bootstrapping world — retain your freedom, execute the way you think is right and grow at a measured pace, build a healthy  real business. You’ll see the double rainbow one day.It’s true. I believe in it too.But (there comes the ‘but bomb’), there are some untold and darker sides to bootstrapping that can kill your company. Let’s talk about them, because it’s important.When you don’t raise money, your story is completely self-made. That’s only good if you have the smarts and discipline.Herein lie the problems.When you don’t have to answer to anybody, your confirmation bias can take you down to dark alleys with dead ends. You do something because you think you are right. When you don’t have to answer or defend, every realization comes after execution and not through borrowed wisdom.There is no exit window because there is no investor. There is no peer cohort because you are not a part of a portfolio. You peer cohort is other bootstrapped startups about whom you may or may not know much. Worst yet, there could be confirmation bias there as well, as each one of you would be treading down the same path at the same pace.Some markets give you the luxury of being one among five players and yet be successful. Some don’t. Certain marketplaces like hyperlocal or transportation don’t allow you to pace growth — you own the place or you don’t. Bootstrapping to profitability does not mean much in such cases.While your business execution happens without much hurry, your personal finance is hurriedly looking for options. The worst thing that can happen in a funding conversation with your existing investor is the realization that they may not participate in the next round. It may be the end of the story and that’s ok.The worst thing in a personal finance conversation with your spouse is that it does not have a logical closure or has a closure that affects you profoundly.While you can be proud about running a real business, if you are bootstrapped you’ve to give yourself a one year run-way. That’s money not spent on aggressive bets. Worst yet, that’s the money that does not earn you interest and yet goes way as tax, when you are not paying salary for yourself.There is, however, some truth to the notion that if you bootstrap you’ve many possible outcomes and most of them will be gratifying. Only that, you’d need to chisel out those outcomes while fighting the trepidating monsters all the way and there is a very real chance that one of them might overpower you.Like Ben Horowitz says in ‘Hard things about hard things’When you are funded, there is a math that dictates the outcome for everyone involved. So that gets talked about a lot. When you are not funded, that math does not exist. But for every variable that dictates the math for the funded company, there is an equivalent variable or a monster that dictates the outcome, when you are bootstrapping a startup.Both fight some monsters. One path isn’t more certain than the other. It would be a disservice to say that bootstrapping is surer path to a reasonable outcome and that’s what is being said again and again.It is not.Founder.Father.Freak - Oh that was fun fing around with lots of Fs!

This past week we formally started to create customer personas for Bliss.It wasn’t planned — we spontaneously jumped into the process — led by the efforts of Also, Dan’s been sitting in on investor pitches and enterprise sales meetings. He’s realized the feedback has been pulling our team in all sorts of directions based on where the outside party believes Bliss should be focusing.When we launched in March, our initial focus was on non-technical entrepreneurs. In April we focused on developers. May and June we then started selling to enterprise concurrent with our efforts of selling to startups.Attempting to reach out to a large, undefined group of people can dilute your messaging strategy and its effectiveness. Kudos for Dan for trying to break through the noise and define our ideal customer!We know the importance of Stepping back and focusing on identifying our buyer personas will lead to a more focused approach. But first, we need to better understand what “Buyer Personas” are all about.The simplest definition is Ultimately, identifying buyer personas will enable you to better understand your buyers and make stronger, more customer-centric decisions in product, marketing, sales — the list goes on. It provides the focus necessary to apply your limited resources appropriately and efficiently.We have existing paying customers, so when we began thinking about a buyer persona we started there. We looked at their demographic information, buying habits, and feedback provided from our direct conversations with them to find similarities across customers. From there, we constructed distinct profiles.Here’s a look.Vice President of Engineering. Manages a team of developers.Aaron runs a team of 10 engineers. His team consists of both in-house and offshore developers.Because of his large, distributed team, he’s not able to review all the code his developers are committing on a regular basis. He doesn’t feel like he has a good grasp of his developers code quality or overall performance. His hectic schedule limits the time he has to dive into GitHub and review the code himself.Slack is the main way the company communicates throughout the day, including the development team.Every morning the development team has a stand-up to review yesterday’s accomplishments, today’s goals, and any bottlenecks impeding progress.One thing we’ve certainly learned through this discovery process is things change!If we had been building and tracking our buyer persona from the beginning it would look very different now than 19 weeks ago.We’re confident in the persona laid out above, but we also understand we need to continue to do research, build upon it, and focus on both our existing and new customers.Bliss is still an early-stage startup expecting to grow (even more rapidly now that Our new approach to buyer personas will enable us to adapt to the changes, and focus our efforts (product, marketing + sales) appropriately and efficiently!CEO of 

About a year ago, Led by When I joined last summer, I did not want to fix what was not broken. The one simple changes we made were the addition of a specific deal for hardware startups (100K for 9% instead of the standard 50K for 6%). My plan was to go thru a first cohort with the program as is, with a specific focus on the alumni network of co-founders, partners (sponsors) and mentors (in that specific order).For me the co-founders who have been thru the program in the past are one of our greatest asset. “People first” sums up my philosophy (for founders, mentors and partners). Still working on aligning more resources for alumnis, that’s still a big goal of mine for 2015. Next up is leveling up our mentor network, putting in place better tools to track mentor/founders interactions (and outcomes).The other tweak I had for the program was to make sure everyone understood really well that this was a 12 x 1 week program, not a big monolithic 3 months stretch… Teams establish weekly goals and we review them during our status update every Thursday. 1 to 3 goals, to be done each week. Helps with focus. Real startups ship.Even if I had been mentoring since the early days in 2011, it was not until I worked full time as GM that I fully understood why there was so much focus on the pitch. I knew communication was key for startup success, but it wasn’t until I got working with John Stokes (partner at Real and catalyst to FounderFuel) on crafting the pitches with startups that I realized it was literally the blueprint of your business. A bad pitch is simply the outcome of a bad (or badly understood) business.In the first weeks, we focus on 3 things: go to market strategy, long term value proposition and competitive landscape. Then with those in minds we tirelessly work with the founders to craft/sharpen/practice their pitch. It is often an identity crisis, at least for many co-founders. You know the old adage: diamonds are created thru pressure…One of my biggest surprise was how much individual attention each team requires. I had this perception that “as a group” was a great way to move everyone forward, and it is, but it’s not enough. My role in coaching co-founders during our status update is quite often “chief unstucker”. What’s top of mind, what’s bugging you, what’s blocking you? Let’s find people, ideas, hacks, to get you out of that rut. Every team gets to schedule time directly with a few mentors, plus office hours every week with partners at Real Venture and experts made available for free from our sponsors.One of my initial analysis, even before joining, after discussing at length with Ian who was just leaving and There are still a few open questions for me. I do feel we need to develop a “post accelerator” program (or process) to better help our founders. We also need to come up with better metrics, ideally standardized in the industry, to assess how well we are accomplishing our mission of accelerating success for startups.There is also the challenge of right-sizing startups in a fast evolving market. I have been thinking about a FounderFuel X program, for more experience founders or repeat entrepreneurs. With more and more startups applying, 250 per cohort on average, and at a later stage, more traction and more maturity, the level of a FounderFuel startup in the Spring 2015 cohort is not the same as one from 2011. The bar keeps getting raised, startups joining our program are further along, raise more money, sooner, even during the program. Those coming in with the existing traction before FF of course get out of the program even more amplified. That’s the definition of acceleration.We are also in a special category, since the accelerator was created from a fund, and not the other way around (as we see more and more these days). It was also built to support the Montréal and broader Canadian startup ecosystem from the get go, in parallel with the If you are interested in exploring some of these questions and sharing some of your own lessons learned, with your accelerator program, please do join us July 15th for a one day event that I helped designed to be an event I would travel across the world to attend, the Next year will mark the 5th anniversary of our accelerator. If you have thoughts on what works, what doesn’t, specifically at FounderFuel or at any other accelerator, I would love to read your insights. We are a startup ourselves, still learning, still working on product/market fit, still growing, still refining our core metrics. We don’t have a model with an exit strategy though, so I guess we will have to keep riding this rocket for the foreseeable future. It’s exhilarating and that’s how I like it!J’écris parce que je dois (et parce que je peux). GM

The journey begun since 4 years ago, I started Sq.Meal — iOS app that helps urban citizens discover FB deals near them.And I’m thankful that my 2 other partners are daring enough to inject USD$30,000 capital to develop what we I was product managing, acquiring brands, online marketing, and learning how to manage contract developers, designers and partner expectations every single moments.Nobody taught me how to sell or growth hack, or pitch to investor.I don’t have the concept of raising funds or applying grants, because my mind is always occupied about meeting goals that I hopelessly set.I then had the bizarre opportunity (using my ex-colleague’s pass) to attend Looking back, I realize the collective failures of my first startup Lack of mindset as a founder, no connections with mentors or experienced entrepreneurs and funding opportunity.Lack of market knowledge and no experience working with developers and designers to build a product the market desire.I’m eager to do it. I want to make things happen. I want a creation of mine. But, do people care? Is that it? So what? How should I become resourceful and able to seize the opportunities, fill the gaps of the surroundings to learn and eventually become real, experience-taught entrepreneur?Thankfully, in 2012, I’ve attended the first ever James gave me one of the best advice I took in my startup journey:I bumped into Jeffrey in Blk71, I then learned about Founder Institute (FI).Jeff, as Director of Founder Institute Singapore (and regional success mentor), has guided me to setup Founder Institute chapter in Kuala Lumpur. I then met Tzu Ming (Running a “night school for entrepreneurs” while keeping my full-time job that puts the food on table has helped me grow slowly but steadily, both professionally and personally.I was grateful to meet many like-minded working professionals and budding entrepreneurs, mentors and angel investors through FI. I started to learn the importance of having a team that could complement ourselves while executing an idea; I picked up the tips on how to communicate to mentors, advisors or investors (people who’s interested on our project). I learned how to kill a bad idea sooner.While learning how to evaluate an idea, I was pretty curious how do we start building something that is worth testing the idea at minimal cost (and time)?This is about the same time I started to join hackathons, won some prizes, and realize that it is not impossible to create something useful in 24–36 hours with a group of multi-talented developers and designers.Thanks to strong initial support by “Mike” Bikesh (Since then, other than organizing I’m super grateful to all my ex-teammates in previous hackathons, because working with them has taught me how to lead a team and develop a desirable outcome (prototypes) based on imaginations of ideas that could improve our lives one way or another.Thanks to all of our sponsors, Jam and Feng whom has helped make all this possible.I’d like to believe that events like hackathon would bring the developers communities closer, and educate more capable minds of problem-solving activities such as coding and product management. We still have a lot of works to do.I then spent the most rewarding 9 months in my lifetime to assist in multiple initiatives (Community/Coworking Space, MaGIC Academy and Building a community wasn’t easy. In fact, nothing in life is easy.In my reflection, I realized what has kept me sane and going, while continue doing what I believe in, are the following guiding principles:I cannot emphasize how much I’ve learned and appreciated the help from everyone I have had the privilege to meet in this life-long journey started 4 years ago. (My friends — while you’re reading this, please know that I remember you whom has helped me along the way, I will forever owe you a favor or two)Nothing was ever planned out as it is, and it has always been driven by sheer serendipity, honest beliefs and some much-needed stubbornness.It is true.StartupMamak, Founder Institute, AngelHack, MaGIC, Corate (...and the next big thing)

A practical guide on what to do and not do in your cover letter and resume.Applying for a job is thankless work. Literally, most of your applications will be ignored. Even great companies often won’t acknowledge job applications.In large part, this occurs because the modern internet has made it very easy to apply to jobs. Just fire off an email to the jobs@ address and you’re done.Of course, this only heightens the problem, more job applicants, less time for the hiring manager (or HR) to look at each one.When you don’t hear back, it reinforces the hopelessness of getting noticed in the first place and makes it more likely you’ll put even less effort into the next job you apply for.It’s not impossible to get hired by simply firing off a resume into the HR black hole. It does happen. It’s more effective at large companies where the first scan may be a simple keyword filter and so finding the right combination of terms for your resume will get you to an actual human.I’m not here to talk about getting hired by big companies though. These days, many of you are seeing the benefits of working for smaller companies and startups. More responsibility, more flexibility, competitive salary and benefits, a chance to have a direct impact on the company vs being a cog in The Man’s wheel.That’s great, I love this. Having run Alas, so many of you are applying to small companies the same way you apply to large ones. This really hurts your chances of getting interviewed and hence hired.If you’re serious about getting hired at a small company it’s critical you understand founders. In pretty much all small business/startup hiring scenarios the founder will be either the sole hiring authority or have a significant say in the matter.The founders #1 priority is trust. They’d hire only people they personally know if they could, but they can’t, so they’re begrudgingly forced to look outside their circle of trust.To a founder, their business IS them. Customers are their children.Let that sink in, because that is how you have to approach this. If you were hiring a babysitter and they showed up at your door half dressed, dirty, and smelled like a bar would you let them watch your kids? They might be the best person in the whole world and have a great explanation as to why they look this way, but that first impression is everything.The first impression is critical to trust, and this is where everyone drops the ball. Applying to BigCo’s has taught you to be lazy, and that is why you fail when applying to small ones. Laziness will kill your job application INSTANTLY.What sorts of lazy things are you doing that are making founders not trust you with their children?Far and away the most important aspect of your application is the cover letter. The resume is practically irrelevant in comparison. Unlike Bigco filtering systems, a founder is going to read that cover letter. The cover letter is our first filter.Trash. Instantly. No second chances for this, you’re too lazy to take a minute and at least customize a cover letter for my company? How can I trust you with my customers?Not 100% sure the owner is who’s going to be hiring? Use a more comfortable and welcoming opening. A simple It lets the founder know you’ve done a little homework and that we should read further to learn more about you.The hiring process is a series of steps. Much like a marketing funnel the point of step A is simply to get you to step B, who’s goal is to get you to step C, etc.If your cover letter is bad I’m not looking at your resume. So the cover letter has a few things to accomplish.A) Help me trust youIf I trust you and you sound interesting (in the context of the job to be done, not interesting as a person though that helps also) I’m likely to read your resume.So how do you build trust and make what you say interesting?This isn’t a creative writing course so let’s just keep it simple. Take it back to 7th-grade English.Your cover letter should have an introduction, a body that restates the problem (the job to be solved and a few key points about how you fit in there), and a conclusion.All of this will need to be custom to the organization/job you’re applying to. Sorry. If you fake it, it’s insanely easy to spot.We’re talking 3–4 tight paragraphs here. Long enough to say something meaningful, but not too long that it becomes burdensome to read. Remember, we’re trying to get the founder to the next step of actually bothering to open your resume.These days, it’s best to have your email be your cover letter. No need for it to be formally formatted inside a doc/pdf. In fact, it’s better to not require employers to take that extra step of having to open a document.I love seeing a few well-placed links in a cover letter. Have a really impressive project you’ve worked on? Link it. Have a website you keep up to date? Link it.At the very least link up Twitter and LinkedIn profiles. I’m going to search for those things anyway, put them right there and save me a step.Often, if the cover letter is good I might search on the person before reading the resume. Lead me to your best stuff.As the hiring authority, I’m going to be getting a lot of emails and resumes. Not being able to tell which resume is which is a big problem for me. It means you might simply get misplaced. It also shows a lack of common sense. Examples of what I get all the time.These are real! If you’re this sloppy with your resume file name how are you going to treat my customers?Examples of good resume titlesThat’s pretty much it. Some variation of your name and maybe the word resume or cv.Resumes should be in PDF format OR be a dedicated site that you link to. On a Mac seeing a docx makes me cry, if the person is on Windows they’re worried about opening random Word docs from strangers. Just make it a PDF and save everyone the trouble.Yes, that’s one more step you’ll have to take to convert your Word doc. Yes, see the pattern here?For some reason, people are taught to keep their resume’s short. I suppose there are some personal preferences here, but I’d rather it be too long than too short.Don’t worry about silly rules like fitting it all on one page. This isn’t 1986; nobody is going to misplace page 2 of your PDF.The thing to understand is that if I’m looking at your resume I already have some trust and interest in you from the cover letter. That means, unless you do something really stupid in your resume I’m probably going to interview you.The interview is really what the resume is all about. The resume brings me up to speed on your background so that we actually have something to talk about in the interview. The more details in the resume, the more questions I can formulate ahead as well as allowing me to skip over other areas that I can see are covered.Make sure the content of your resumes gives potential interviewers enough facts and details to build a conversation around. Also, please don’t load it with keywords. When you’re applying for to a small company a short section on the technology you know is fine. Save the huge list of every tech you’ve ever touched for The Man.Unlike the cover letter which should be nearly 100% custom, the resume can be pretty generic. Your history is what it is.I often see people who have obviously replaced some other bullet point for one that seems more fitting for the job they’re applying for. That can be OK, however, removing an impressive accomplishment for a mediocre job relevant point may not be a win.This is a biggie. First, your resume needs to be easy to read. Echoing the above, don’t shoehorn everything onto one page just because. Keep proper line spacing and readable font sizes.Break up your sections into logical groups for easy scanning and reference during an interview.I’m personally a big fan of using some color on your resume. Just a touch helps you stand out and can make the resume more readable and memorable. A photo or some other element is also OK.The eternal question. Unless you’re directly out of school education goes below experience. Even then, if you’ve had some good internships or other job experience, it might make sense to put it above education.We’re moving to a world where what you know is more important than what a school’s name implies you know.You don’t have to do this, but if you really have a dream job you’re going after think of ways to go above and beyond. Can you build a custom website for just the job At best an objective won’t hurt your chances. On the flip side, it often conveys the genericness of your job search. Applying for a job in support with an objective of being a software engineer? Trash.Instead of an objective, I’d rather see a well written About section. A sort of overview of who you are. Use it as a place to convey important information about yourself that isn’t present in the other resume sections or to emphasize something extremely important.If you put in a really good effort on your cover letter but haven’t heard back be sure to follow up. People get busy, email gets lost. It can’t hurt to follow up.If you just sent an email that says here’s my resume, of course don’t bother.* You should have a professional email address with your name in it. Not peewee79.Well then, better keep pushing! A founder of a small company has gone through YEARS of personal sacrifice. Are you upset nobody responded to your cover letter? Try harder. Try something different. Apply to different jobs. Get some more experience. Present a new angle of yourself. Find something that works. We did, you can to.Founder of UserScape

I’m not a Community Manager like my friend Starting from fanfiction forums when I was a teen to this day (at 28), I’ve been an active member/moderator/manager of almost 20 communities, although some might not qualify as communities depending on the definition you’re going with. My definition is simply:It’s really hard for a startup to become a community. And yet there’s a perfect example for how it can be done successfully under our noses — But it didn’t happen overnight. The key here is that Ryan Hoover Another example is And here lies my point:For example, before I grew my own “collaborative community” back in 2012, I already had a network of writers on twitter, whom I later called out on Goodreads. (Confused? That’s my fault. Just read on…Communities follow a natural progression, which I’ve outlined in the form of a pyramid. And whatever you say, you and I both know what the objective is: a platform. To get there, there’s an hierarchy, and here it is:← First let’s look at the types of communities.0. dormant community — every community is dormant until someone flips the switch and makes it an active community. Whether it’s the founders, the members, the… aliens?! The key is to make people connect — without this, the community is a dud.There are 2 types of dormant communities — one that “acts the part” and one that has the potential. One is clearly more valuable than the other.0.1. The community’s there on paper but its members are not actively engaging. So most startups that try to be a platform from the start suffer this fate — the people are strangers, everybody’s just sharing their stuff, and in the end, nobody’s really interested in anyone else but themselves.0.2. The community’s there (in the form of a network) but it hasn’t been activated. So, for example, a group of people on twitter. It’s not quite a community because it doesn’t serve Once a community has been activated, things get interesting.But before I outline the 3 main types, bear in mind: the order is based on size, but that doesn’t automatically mean that startups evolve in this order. For example, any of the first two communities can grow into each other or grow into a platform, but the platform still remains the highest option. There’s really no wrong way to go except starting from the top.It’s funny to witness — a startup trying to be a platform from the start. They pay for ads, ask people to vouch, beg them to join and create a profile, but most of all, they ask you to return, but you never do. How could you? There are no people there!I would recommend no startup EVER try to be a platform from the start. It’s better to The other day a friend suggested Buffer became a platform. I smiled because I thought he was so right to suggest it. They can totally pull it off.Isn’t it better to remain solvent and keep your values rather than sell out and spend the next few months/years trying to push a giant rock up a mountain? We all love the Sisyphus simile, but the task becomes plain impossible if you set the wrong goals.If your startup’s meant to be a platform,Ryan Hoover mentioned he hoped Product Hunt would be a platform one day. When I first heard this I thought “But what can it offer that Put simply, Product Hunt has the advantage of If it does become a platform, the challenge will be keeping the engagement levels high. It’s a fact that the bigger a community becomes, the more engagement suffers, not to mention people’s tendency to be highly narcissistic and/or competitive on social sharing sites.So it all depends on the team. I personally think they can handle it.Sometimes I wish a community would just stay medium-sized for the sake of its users, but that’s just unrealistic. These days everyone wants the big bucks, the big dreams, and the big platforms. Everyone wants the big stuff, and I don’t blame them. I would want the same for my startup.*Writes a lot.

Nous disons vivre dans une société qui manque de travail. Nous disons qu’il n’y a pas de travail. Il y a deux ans, un homme, une startup m’ont intrigué. Ma passion s’est réveillée, mes idées ont éclos, l’intérêt professionnel a diminué au profit du sens.Pendant un an, j’ai rencontré des dizaines d’hommes et femmes fondateurs de startups, amoureux de startups; tous habités, tous passionnés.J’ai cru en ces hommes avant de croire en leur produit, j’ai cru en leur culture avant de croire au changement. En l’espace de 12 mois, l’écosystème a fleurit, et avec lui les opportunités d’apporter ses talents et ses compétences. Rapidement, j’ai réalisé la puissance fédératrice qui s’empare de son monde quand on agit avec le coeur. Les collaborations qui naissent, les idées qui transforment, les possibilités qui émergent.Pourquoi ? Parce qu’il y a du travail, des métiers, et un nombre d’opportunités insoupçonnées. Parce qu’il faut arrêter de se laisser porter pour apprendre à choisir, à refuser, et s’autoriser à inventer.Les startups ne brillent que par l’énergie qu’elle nécessite. La bonne volonté qu’on se doit de mettre dedans. Derrière la lumière diffuse de l’amour de son job, se cache une résilience, une quantité de travail et de remises en question presque impossibles à évoquer sans se tromper. L’exercice difficile de ne pas abandonner, en dépit du manque de temps, d’argent, de réponses, de compréhensions extérieures, est la partie la plus difficile de l’aventure.Et c’est dur. Ça fait vibrer, ça fait avancer, mais c’est dur. Ce n’est pas travailler pour ce qu’on aime, c’est aussi incarner ce qu’on est par ce que l’on fait. Il faut se connaitre, et avoir des bases assez solides pour accepter de s’y perdre.On ne se remet jamais de la passion. Mais ça vaut le coup.On a peur. Ne cherchons pas plus loin. Partir essayer, c’est se risquer à rater, ou à perdre. La difficulté n’est pas de changer son point de vue pour se penser capable de réussir, mais bien d’intégrer que nous allons rater des choses avant d’apprendre, et pour avancer.Évidemment que cela dérange et bouscule. Évidemment que cela est différent. Différent en terme d’approches, de méthodes, de réflexions. Une startup cherche. Elle cherche le secret d’un marché, la solution d’un problème, et par définition, un business model. Une startup cherche et ne trouvera jamais. Le jour où elle découvre le secret, la solution, le business model, elle meurt. Elle meurt pour devenir autre chose. En attendant, s’atteler à percer avec une équipe ce qui permettra à cette startup de marquer une différence dans la vie des gens, revient à accepter ne jamais savoir. Et être passionné d’essayer.Je n’ai pas choisi de créer ma startup. Je suis fascinée par l’aventure humaine qui résonne au même rythme que les talents professionnels.

Avito, the Accel-backed Russian online classifieds company, is a startup you may never have heard of; it is also a very special one.The company morphed from a kind of old school yellow pages and auction site in 2007 into a pure play online classifieds by 2008 and never looked back, becoming ​a leader in every classifieds category it entered, from dogs and cats to real estate to cars and general classifieds.Accel co-led a $75M investment with Baring Vostok and joined the board in early 2012. We are delighted to announce that Naspers is taking a majority stake in Avito, in aAt the heart of Avito’s success is the very unique story of The online classifieds sector is an attractive winner-takes-all market: if a player can reach 3–5x the size of the second actor in the relevant categories, that company benefits from a snowball effect, achieving superior liquidity and becoming difficult to displace. Examples include CraigsList in the US or LeBonCoin in France. But whilst there is a well understood blueprint of what it takes to build a leading vertical classifieds business, Avito gets incredibly strong marks for achieving leadership in both horizontal as well as vertical categories: We are truly grateful to have been involved in one of the great marketplace stories of our time, and send (Co-authored with my partner Sonali de Rycker who sponsored this great investment and is a proud supporter of Team Avito)Helping startups grow with money and mentoring to the sounds of Crystal Castles


It was 2013. I have been working at an enterprise product company coding distributed systems for a huge codebase that took 1 hour to build even on a monster machine. Nine months into the job, I got bored. I decided to seek new opportunities and started looking for startups. I talked to several startups, interviewed with few of them, got some offers and joined a good one and worked there for two years before taking the current time off.Before you decide you want to work for a startup, please ensure that it is for the right reasons. Most of the times, a startup work would involve lengthy hours, OK salary, ESOPs which are worthless and work that will take up your entire life for the years you work on it. It is perfectly right to work at a large MNC for all your life if you are happy. Working at a startup is not as cool and it NOT going to magically uplift your happiness level. Finding the right startup to work for is difficult, so here is a list of pitfalls and red flags to avoid.Most of the time, people mistake perks for the company’s culture. It started with Google and some other companies providing perks to make their employees lives comfortable so that they can focus more on their work. So if you ask someone about the culture (A good culture would be say a place where employees are treated with respect and heard no matter their designation, where you could ask for help if stuck without being shunned, where you are not penalised for making mistakes but corrected, where work and building the product takes a priority over petty politics, where your work is all that matters and not the location or time of the day when you do it (but obviously respect other people’s time). In tech, culture could be no code deployed to production without running unit tests and code-reviewed by a peer, small incremental deployments, documenting stuff for future employees, great onboarding of new employees so that they can feel at home and start contributing from the first day itself, listening to everyone with a valid point before making major tech decisions etc.Now to attract a typical 21–28 years old single employee, companies tend to create a lot of artificial noise on channels that matter (Quora, startup blogs, their own tech blog posts writing about something very trivial). People need to justify their decision of joining a startup to themselves, their friends earning a lot more money, their parents who want them to work at bigger companies and their dog who loves them, that working so hard at this obscure 4 person startup is a better idea that the big beautiful glass building nearby.Choose a startup that values the work you do, and you feel has more chances to succeed not the one which has a cool office or provides free beer.How do you do that? Look for red flags, companies which are small but have lots of people leaving or getting fired. Lookup past or current employees on LinkedIn who might be friends of friends.If you are in for the right reasons and not illusioned by PCQ as described above, read on.Here are some signs of startups which signal danger and you should avoid working for them. Most of the points here relates to a culture where people would not be respected, shows shady ethics or are just plain stupid.“All our hires are from IITs, Stanford and Hogwarts”, the HR said coolly and continued working on something important when asked about the work culture. But I still wanted to discuss the CTC, but considering this was the first offer I received, I did not want to appear as someone who is in for the money. But I still needed the details. I called the last person to interview me and had a chat. He laid down some below-expectation numbers with a bonus of working with people with great pedigrees.It is always great to work with and learn from people with better skills than you. I have work with some brilliant colleagues who graduated from some of the world’s best universities, but I never heard them ever bringing it up in any discussions. I have also worked with colleagues who had a modest educational background but were great at self-learning. If it had been limited to the HR shit talk then maybe it would be justifiable but when your potential colleagues start discriminating on the basis of pedigree, you should know it is not a good sign for future work-related decisions.This was a leading e-commerce company. ‘Your telephonic interview went well, please send a couple of dates in next two weeks for onsite’. Mail sent, two weeks passed, again new mail. Please send a couple of dates again for onsite. I sent a mail; ‘Not interested’. A series of apologies from some people followed, but I was simply not interested by then.Last I checked, the HR guy who was handling this switched companies the same month. So either he was fired or he was switching companies and was on his notice period and was simply uninterested in doing his job.The basic fact about compensation is neither the startup nor you are in it for charity. You have some skills which have a certain market value and would like to work at a great place where you can use the skills to benefit the startup and have some fun.There was a founder who wondered how my current company was able to pay so much. In his words, “No company in this city pays this much”.In another case, the founder started haggling for around 1 lakh rupees. Not a good sign for future appraisals meets if they ever had one.Everyone is busy at a high growth startup. But that does not mean you should not honour your commitments and that too repeatedly. It is a red flag that you do not care about others and their time.You should never start considering an offer unless it is being given to you in writing over an email. One common mistake is agreeing to a promise of undefined stock options to be given at some uncertain time in future. Most of the time, this never happens and the founder backs out of the deal. First make sure what you want from the company. Then get it all written down in writing in the offer letter.When you are a large company, processes help you keep organised and improves productivity. But when you are a 2 person startup looking to hire their first employee, replying to a well-worded direct mail with attached resume with a link to their careers page form is not a good idea. You should be open to using multiple channels and tools for hiring. Recruitment is hard and I hope they must have realised by now and improved upon this.Startups, please invest more time in hiring and don’t be mean. Sometimes you need great employees more than they need you.Engineer. Learning.

Public and private incubators and accelerators for startups have become what their respective owners are. Publicly funded accelerators lack the drive they try to instill. Instead, they are driven by bureaucracy (and sometimes a political agenda). Accelerators created and owned by larger companies are just a tool for “entrepreneurship-washing” the holding company. Similar to “greenwashing”, this means that the holding company doesn’t really embrace (corporate) entrepreneurship, but it rather uses the accelerator as tool for employer branding and PR, to offer an entrepreneurial appearance.If you want to encourage entrepreneurship, if you want to facilitate the creation of new jobs, if you want people to tackle big problems in our society, you need to create a self-sustaining system. Each graduating class should have a fair chance of paying it forward to the next incoming class.So the to-do list for a startup school looks like this:So while this to-do list describes the overall structure of startup school, how should the curriculum be designed?We don’t need more incubators or accelerators to make more good ideas flourish. We need to connect the dots, see how different elements play together when it comes to supporting future entrepreneurs and startups.Thanks to Thomas Schranz (Coaching startups and corporate entrepreneurs.

Around the time I’m often reminded to go back and reread both of these posts. And am inspired, again and again. So I thought I’d take the opportunity to augment the PIE mentor guidance a bit with some things that we’ve learned from observing PIE startups and mentors over the years.We shared these tips with the PIE mentors and a few of them suggested we turn it into a blog post for the broader mentor community.So we took that mentoring to heart.If you’re thinking about becoming a mentor for startups — either in a formal accelerator program or independently — here are some tips for thinking about how to work with entrepreneurs.Mentors often worry that they need to come up with some earth-shattering insights to be of value. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Fact of the matter is that you spend day-in, day-out working in your area of expertise.All of that — all of that built up knowledge — is of incredible value to an entrepreneur who is in the middle of a maelstrom of activity. Or who hasn’t yet gained the experience. So think of the simple things. Think of the obvious. And share those insights.Because your common sense is not common.While sharing your victories can be motivating for startups and entrepreneurs, being open about your failures and mistakes can often be more helpful. The stumbles and downfalls are the things that caused you to lose sleep, to stress, and to doubt. Share those. So that everyone can learn from them.We always say that PIE is about “making new mistakes.” There are two reasons: 1) If startups are repeating mistakes our mentors have already made, we’re failing them and 2) If the startups go out and make new mistakes, then they can come back as mentors to prevent others from making those mistakes.You were asked to mentor because of your experience. And because you’re awesome. But that doesn’t mean you need to know everything. Nor does it mean the onus is on you to know everything.You’ll be surprised at how seemingly simple things can drastically improve a startup’s potential and perspective.This one became especially clear with our corporate mentors. Sometimes, you have to take off your “brand hat” and put away your business card.You are an incredibly talented individual who has made it to the position you’re in because of the decisions you’ve made. And its your insight and intellect that guided those decisions — that brought you to your current role. Sometimes, just being you and providing personal advice can be incredibly beneficial.Don’t over promise. Don’t under deliver. And don’t get yourself into a mentoring situation that has you feeling stressed. An hour of your time is valuable. If that’s all you have to give, that’s all we’re asking you to give.It’s the opportunity to share what you’ve learned. And to prevent others from making the mistakes you’ve made. It should be seen as such.Mentors are often driven individuals who have attained their position through sheer determination and hard work. They’re often people who take the wheel and try to steer others in the right direction. And they’re used to leading.And fact of the matter is that — no matter how vehemently you support or oppose an entrepreneur’s decision — in the end, it is his or her decision to make. Not yours. And s/he has to be the one to make it. Not you.We take this from the vantage of an employee or consultant advising his or her superiors. “This is my opinion on what should be done, but you’re the boss.” Mostly because I’m fairly sure I’ll be working for one these entrepreneurs one day.While mentoring can be a lot about bolstering the outlook for new entrepreneurs and motivating them to change the world, that’s not the goal of mentoring. The goal of mentoring is positive. But the path may not be.Sometimes, your feedback will be negative. Sometimes, your feedback will be difficult. But it should always be honest and critical — in both the positive and negative sense of the word.You’re not here to rescue anyone. You’re here to provide startups with feedback. And you’re here to challenge them. That’s all we ask. If you want to take an entrepreneur under your wing, please feel free. But don’t feel obligated to solve their problems.More often than not, the problems you see haven’t even dawned on them yet. So tell them. But don’t try to fix the problems for them.We want you to be invested. We want you to be happy and frustrated and proud and confounded. We want you along for the roller coaster ride. We need you to take this personally.At times, it will be completely aggravating. But that means you’re taking it personally. And that’s what these entrepreneurs need.You’re not just here to give. You’re here to get. It’s a two-way street. So talk to other mentors. Get advice from the startups. Get advice from your peers. Get advice from anyone in the community.And be equally willing to listen when another mentor wants to impart their knowledge to you.Halfassing Thoughts on the world of startups from PIE

This was how I introduced myself after launching my first startup not long after completing the National Youth Service Corp program in the summer of 2012. Prior to that, I had been writing about the local technology ecosystem when it dawned on me to go from writing stories to becoming part of the story.As fate will have it, a classmate from my time at the University of Lagos, Deji Opoola, reached out with the idea that first became LazyAppetite before re-branding to EasyAppetite. It was indeed a roller-coaster experience with many ups and downs, but ultimately a learning experience I have come to cherish.This is no postmortem as that will be a book-size publication. However, I’d rather in retrospect, share the good, bad and ugly that came out of failing at Nigeria’s first online takeaway site:The big e-commerce wave hit Nigeria about 3 years ago with the entry of Rocket Internet companies like Sabunta and Kasuwa that later merge to become today’s In no time it became common place to buy electronics, books, and clothes online. This was the new trend we spotted before launching a food vertical. It was a no-brainer as it was all about creating an online market place where supply met demand, and so we hit the road, pitched to over 50 restaurants and signed up 10 to launch LazyAppetite.com.In little or no time, we had competition with Our first mover advantage was going down the drain so we decided to go after a niche student market as well as sign up exclusive deals with restaurants in the Yaba-Akoka area with our biggest score being the famous White House. We also focused on having the Remember I mentioned we pitched to about 50 restaurants and only launched with 10 of them. This was because many were skeptical, overly cautious, or just didn’t want to disrupt their current business process. This birthed a At Level-1, we waived the usual 15% commission for pre-launch restaurant partners for the first 3 months. This way there was no hesitation in terms of revenue share and we had room to prove ourselves. Level-2 had us update our pitch deck with a final slide with all 10 restaurant logos and let EasyAppetite had 5 co-founders at the time we decided to turn off the lights. One founder had theDon’t get me wrong, from a functional point-of-view having a team of 5 was solid, but if I was to do it again maybe it’d just be 2 co-founders and 3 first-hires who’d get a reasonable amount of equity, nothing close to the 35% that had to be let go.I sometimes refer to EasyAppetite as my trial-and-error startup. There was a lot of guess work which should not to be confused for taking risk, as well as impulsive decision which is not the same as going with your guts.This was a first time at the rodeo and we hardly knew when to use our heads or hearts. Perhaps if we talked more to experts, sought advise from successful entrepreneurs, gotten Sim Shagaya on our board, we’d have been better off. It’d be stupid to attribute failure solely on lack of advice but then again there is After all said and done, beyond passion, team and customers acquired, success in the business world is down to At EasyAppetite we pooled together the starting capital in bits and bobs that it became impossible to tell how much had gone into the business. Our books was very messy from day 1 so much so it was hard to tell how much revenue we got from commissions, harder to figure out how much had gone into the business, and hardest to come to a valuation for a possible exit.Someone once defined entrepreneurs as those who jump off a cliff before starting to build a parachute. Entrepreneurship is for the crazy, resilient, hard-headed, doers, and for those who live on the edge.We started right when we launched Nigeria’s first online takeaway site and called it LazyAppetite but after a while we left the edge for the easy road — re-branded to EasyAppetite so as not to offend an adult demography, gave away chunks of equity for quick wins, not to mention never actually giving 100% to the venture — all recipes for failure.This is neither a postmortem nor is it a lamentation. I am ever thankful for the opportunity to take a first plunge at startups with all I worked and engaged with during my spell at EasyAppetite. I only hope these lessons are of value to other entrepreneurs out there about to launch their first, second, or umpteenth startup.Internet Entrepreneur and Digital Media Strategist doing really cool stuff at 

That feeling when you don’t know how to move forward. When you have a lot you It’s like standing on the edge of a swimming pool, ready to dive in, but instead just waiting.Making yourself busy, keeping yourself occupied with jobs that should be done. The website needs updating — cool. This new feature needs testing — no problem. The plants need watering — I’m on it. It’s fine because you’re busy except it’s not. It’s not fine at all and you know it.There’s an underlying feeling that you should be doing more — I don’t mean more tasks, but The dangerous thing about startups is that there’s always stuff that needs doing — and sometimes they are big and important. And this includes everyone — whether you’re leading the support team, acquiring customers or developing the product. Everything is a work in progress and most things could be better but you’re navigating uncertainty to find the best way. (I’m not saying this isn’t the case for everyone working for larger companies too but I think it’s amplified in startups because there are fewer boundaries that define your job and role).So the problem is that startup paralysis can never end. It can go on for months at a time. And it’s frustrating and makes you forget why you even care about what you do.At the company where I work, my job is ‘Operations Director’ so it is kind of my job to do these tasks. But it reality, I’m not doing what I was hired for unless I am having the biggest impact on growth for the company at this very moment in time. Anything that isn’t is using up scarce resources.Sometimes it’s because you’re scared to make a decision or sometimes it’s because there’s a haze around that stops you being able to identify what’s important right now. But for whatever reason, the resulting paralysis affects the company. And I get it, the job of a startups is to navigate uncertainty and it’s hard. But that makes it even more important for you to always strive for progress.The answer might be simpler than you think. It may just be identifying what you don’t know, and how to find this out. It might be talking to a customer, user or advisor.There are two main effects of startup paralysis that I think will resonate:Firstly, you’re not growing and developing as much as you could be. There’s no real end goal to what you’re working on day-to-day so it’s difficult to tell if you’re achieving anything at all. It’s hard to make progress if you have no measure by which to improve.Secondly, there is the frustration — an underlying feeling that you have more to give but somehow you can’t. You’re paralysed. This is highly detrimental to your own peace of mind and motivation to continue in your work.I am a firm believer in small wins. Small wins are reinforcing mechanisms -they build momentum and pave the way towards higher goals. So the cure is simpler and smaller than you think.Firstly admit that you’re paralysed — it’s okay, it happens to a lot of people. Talk to someone about it — a friend, sibling, colleague or mentor.And secondly, use small wins to propel yourself into motion — I really like James Clear’s blogpost about It sounds too simple but that’s the beauty of it. You can do it right now.Here are a few resources I find helpful — I hope you do too.

Fail  learn or fail, don’t learn  complain about how hard life is on you.Yes, I was 17 when I founded my first start-up. This should not be a huge surprise, but it was a total disaster, so after 5 months I pulled the plug and killed it. No hard feelings — moving on.There is no surprise that right now, it’s super cool to say that you’re a founder of a (name) start-up. Entrepreneurs think that they have the next big idea and will totally succeed (FYI, I thought the same way), but 9 times out of 10 start-ups fail. Or those geniuses entrepreneurs still think that they’re going to hit a jackpot just like Instagram or Tinder did and continue to create/copy So here’s what I learned about start-ups while still being in high school. I’m sure that most of the things will seem pretty obvious before starting a start-up, but it’s very different to know things and to apply that knowledge.It’s just the way it is. You can’t be a designer, programmer, sales person, social media marketer at the same time. You need people smarter than you in your team. But here, there is another trap that you can get into: choosing the wrong co-founders and team members. Always think ahead: are you sure that you want to spend a lot of time working together with that person? Do you know him/her well enough? There is a reason, why most of the successful start-up founders and entrepreneurs, say that the team is the most important thing.I started way to young. I was still in high school, exams were around the corner, was working late nights and weekends and was practicing karate couple times a week and that is why I failed very quickly. I’d suggest if you’re still in high school and really really want to start something — don’t! Finish school, get into university and if you’re still have that desire to build something, try to do it with your dorm friends. It will be fun and if you will fail, it won’t hurt much. I really don’t want to give advice for people who work and have families, because I have no family and kids myself, but I just want to say this: make sure that your family won’t suffer financially and emotionally.For the first timers it always seems that the idea is everything, but it’s not. Everyone has ideas, but what truly matters is execution. For example, everyone knows Uber, but does everyone know that before Uber there was ZipCar? Or before AirBnB — Rentobi? There will always be a competitor, no matter what kind of idea you have. The only way you can beat them is by outworking them, your idea itself is worth Seeking perfection is not a bad thing, but when you’re working on a start-up — it is. Don’t waste your time on perfecting your idea, just build the first version of your product and launch it. Users will tell what is wrong and you will see what you have to fix and what you should improve or else you will end up with the product that no one wants to use after you were building it for months.One of the saddest things is to see your product fail. You spent so much time working on it and for what? Failure!? I was devastated when my start-up failed, but when I look back, I know that I learned a ton. About myself, product development, working with people from different cultures and more. It is very easy to be negative, blame everyone and trow in the towel, but this is what shapes us. Behind every failure, there’s a lesson and you just have to find it.Thanks for reading!International business student | Self — Starter | Dreamer | Traveler | Runner | Karate kid | Cooking enthusiast | Music, sunrise  NYC fan | Marketing lover

So last night I got retweeted by Mark Cuban. As a business student who is trying to start a business naturally I was stoked! I quickly started tell all my friends and family about what had just happened…and then I realized something… Mark retweeted me for a reason. Obviously what I had said/done had some significant value to a crowd Cyberdust was trying to reach out to. This was reaffirmed when several entrepreneurs started tweeting me, dusting me, and emailing me asking me how I got feedback on my startup, so I decided to help and gave them these tips:After giving them these tips and a list of names to get started with on Cyberdust I had my second “aha!” moment. I had just developed a following from helping people. As someone who is a part of a team developing an app to help people in the startup community, I had just created our initial user base.So in the grand scheme of things…I reached out to knowledgeable people for help, they helped me and I expressed how thankful I was publicly. In return, that lead to other people in the startup community asking me for help on how to reach these same people. I was able to receive help and give help simultaneously, and this has now strengthened my network vertically. I was helped out by people who knew more than I did, and I helped them by driving followers and business their way. I helped people who knew less than I did, and they’ve began to help me plan how to approach our product development.I’m not saying you’re going to be retweeted by Mark Cuban, Ryan Ozo, and Cyberdust every time you give Cyberdust a shout-out, but you can leverage this app by buying into the Cyberdust community going to them for help, and then helping them in return. If you have a startup idea ask the experts, recommend them to others and grow your personal networking influence and business.Need additional tips?

Should I start-up?Over the last few months, a number of people have asked me this question in different flavours.My answer — I don’t know, because I have never started up. But if you still care about my opinion — Just the fact that you are asking the question, may be you should not — at least not just yet.Starting up requires a great deal of When you startup, you will need to convince 3 key stakeholders: customers, employees  investors — about your vision. This is super hard and to be able to do it, your own conviction will need to be deep  authentic.Does that mean, you shouldn’t talk to anyone or seek inputs - Well, thats an option. My suggestion would be to talk to people you respect, to hear their views — Look for ideas/concerns they bring up, that you think are important to the problem and you haven’t thought about yet. DO NOT go blindly by what they have to say — regardless of who the advisor is.As an entrepreneur — what you bring to the world, is your conviction in importance of the problem AND your way of solving it. Ensure the fire is strong in you, before you think of spreading the flame.Indian; techie; optimist; student for life; entrepreneurial; believe in people; Helped build  scale Flipkart; Interested in Education  Social Impact

After three of the most rewarding years of my professional career, it’s bittersweet to share that this week I will say goodbye to Karma was founded three years ago with a massive vision to reinvent the broken telecom industry and bring seamless connectivity to the masses. Since then, we’ve launched two generations of Karma devices, have grown our monthly revenues from $0 to $1M, have scaled our team to 25, and have transformed our advertising efforts from just $5k in monthly spend into an extensive multi-channel acquisition strategy.As the first employee and an integral part of the founding team, I handled tasks both large and small, from setting up operational and HR processes, to personally shipping hundreds of devices, to traveling across the country only to wait in the freezing cold as I rescued our inventory from our then bankrupt distributor.During my time at Karma, I’ve accumulated a wealth of operational knowledge, helped to build a team with a top-notch culture, and learned how best to maintain brand loyalty despite hardware delays and setbacks. However, my biggest takeaway from the experience is one that is more personal — I’ve learned that the best way to get ahead is to admit what you don’t know upfront, surround yourself with experts in those areas, listen and learn. This simple strategy propelled me within Karma allowing me to go from joining as a former investment banker with no marketing knowledge, to later leading our entire marketing team.I’m incredibly proud of all that we have accomplished and am excited to be leaving at a time in which the company is well set up for success.And now, I will begin my next chapter as I join What drew me to Primary in particular was Brad and Ben’s personal investment in the growth and success of each one of their portfolio companies. They are genuinely committed to doing whatever it takes to support their portfolio, as evidenced by the creation of and importance placed behind my full-time role. As a fund, Primary is experimenting, innovating and willing to invest real money and resources into supporting their companies long after they’ve made an initial investment.Since my days as an Associate at I’m excited to apply these learnings and my passion to build a best-in-class platform, find ways ways to add real, meaningful value to our portfolio companies, and make Primary a truly differentiated player in the early stage venture community.Joining a company at the very beginning is not just another job in which you have co-workers and an office — you become a family. I’m forever grateful to my founders While I will embark on this new journey next week, I will remain a close friend and supporter of the Karma team. If you haven’t already been bombarded by my Facebook posts, Tweets, and emails over the years, expect to hear plenty more. With the recent shipping of our second generation product Onto the next chapter…VP Marketing 

I love getting the right tools in place that can amplify the results of everything else we do. These are the leverage points that we should always be trying to tap in to to replicate our results for all of our clients.We have a shortlist of tools that we always recommend to our clients to drastically improve our progress, in the spirit of transparency we want to share those recommendations with you. Some are pretty straightforward, some are a bit more discreet.These tools take us through the entire content marketing process, amplifying our results not only from knowing what content to publish, but to increase email subscribers, to increase social shares, to be consistent with social media sharing, and to be consistent with quality email campaigns.Here are the 5 tools you should implement right now to drastically increase your effectiveness in all of your content marketing efforts:This one is pretty simple. If you have blog posts bringing in gobs of traffic, you need to be trying to make them convert into email subscribers. An email subscriber list is the one piece of equity that you completely control in regards to communicating with your audience. A social media presence is fantastic, but the highest converting source of traffic and customers that you can have will always be an email marketing list.An email list is the highest barrier to entry “follow” you can get, apart from a paying customer. That’s what makes it so valuable, apart from obvious open rate differences between email and Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.SumoMe’s Listbuilder is immensely easy to set up and is one of the easiest ways to increase email signups that I’ve ever seen. People are often put off of implementing pop-ups on their own sites or blog, but the proof is in the pudding. They work, they don’t increase bounce rates (beyond a fractional amount) but they do increase email signup rates dramatically. I’ve seen this first hand, but if you want a bit more data to back up that claim, check out tSeeing as by this point you should have already set up SumoMe’s Listbuilder on your site, you’re literally two clicks away from having “Share” installed as well. This one has already been featured on our blog when we were talking about how to gShare is a tool that you can set up in seconds, and have one of the most cleanly laid out, most effective social sharing tools on the market directly on your site (for free, or you can use the paid version to get more out of it). The best part of this tool to me is the mobile share bar aesthetic. When people view your content on desktop it’s pretty easy to get an app that will scroll next to your content, but on mobile it’s an entirely different story. Share places a fantastic looking bottom bar directly on the page that sticks with you as you scroll, which will help increase social shares dramatically as more and more people view your site on their phones and tablets.If you don’t have a very, very good custom team setting up this sort of thing on a custom basis, SumoMe’s “Share” is a fantastic tool to set up in minutes to increase your social shares. Its innate simplicity and effectiveness is exactly why we use it on our blog.Everyone can have a MailChimp account up to a certain threshold without paying for it. That’s just part of their freemium model. However I recommend everyone upgrade to specifically get their incredible marketing automation toolset. With the amount of integrations, and abilities to automate you email chains and set up drip campaigns, this tool can be one of the most effective content marketing tools you can possibly pay for. At $9/month that is probably some of the most effective marketing budget you will ever pay for as well.If you have customers signing up for certain lists positioned to be a drawn out drip campaign of say, 7 emails before pitching your product as the final “hoorah” — this is the tool to use. Welcome emails, customized responses, and product recommendations aside, our favorite part will always be the drip campaigns and behavioral targeting specifically for content marketing purposes.Buffer is our favorite email scheduling app there is, bar none. We’ve used HootSuite and the rest, and nothing compares in simplicity and effectiveness. It’s easy to implement across a large team, adding everyone’s company pages and personal profiles to, and easily auto-scheduling posts, implementing RSS feeds, and pushing out new updates across all accounts at the click of a button.One very nice way you can set things up is to analyze your own followers with FYou want a great tool for content marketing research? Stop here. This is what you need.Search for influencers, search for the most effective posts on certain domains (competitors or popular blogs), through certain keywords, or through the most shared authors. Everything you need to formulate an extremely effective content marketing campaign is here. The pro plan is a bit costly, but it’s totally worth it in the amount of effort it will cut out from a research perspective, and the efficiency it will bring to your content marketing efforts.Find the people to follow, who to interact with, the content they share, how to engage with them, and build a relationship so that they will contribute or share your content. This is just one of the ways you can use this tool to amplify your efforts.These are just 5 of the tools we recommend, but they are 5 of the best. We want to focus this blog on the 80/20 principle, the 20% of the effort that will yield 80% of the results, these are surely the 20% of tools that will yield 80% of your content marketing results.

What if investing in early stage startups wasn’t just financial? Exchanging a few shares of a startup’s capital against mentoring or advice — sometimes in addition to seed money — is a trend that is becoming more and more serious. It started with accelerators like Today, startup studios change the rules of the game by providing intensive human efforts in addition of funding seed money.The chart below maps early stage startups investors according to the volume of human and financial capital provided.To simplify, human capital is measured in man-hours. Although it is a practical way to quantify the human investment provided it doesn’t well represent the quality of the contribution. bring on the table a small amount of money (around a few $10k) and usually dedicate a limited amount of time and resources. Business angels’ contribution is generally restricted to some strategic advice and personal introduction. When they are more organized, provide more money and take more active role in portfolio companies they are called provide a more substantial amount of money (between $20k and $100k) in exchange for equity (usually around 5–10%). In this model, a large number of hand-picked startups — usually tens of startups per batch and between 1–5% acceptance rate — benefit from mentorship and education during a few months. Most of the accelerators offer a strong network of usually take a much bigger slice of the cake but provide a fully dedicated team and a lot of financial and human resources to a small number of companies (not more than a few each year), along with a strong platform (tools, a network and knowledge). Some studios own the ideation process while some work with very early stage companies. Studios’ support might last long, generally few years, and in some cases during the entire startup’s life.aim at providing an important amount of money to startups (from a few 100ks to several million for early stage rounds) in exchange for equity (around 20–30%). In addition to money, they bring governance, control, and advice, especially during board meetings. VCs sometimes have a dedicated team offering extra support to portfolios startups in the form of legal, managerial, strategical help.

I’m new to the founder game. That’s why my company is a But I’ve always felt a bit…off about how startups are perceived. Specifically, I take issue with which companies are considered “startups”, and which companies are not. Before I started But today put me over the top. Today I stumbled onto an article from the summer about “startups to watch”. At the top of the list was DraftKings. Yes, tiny DraftKings might blow up at any moment. Until then, we will just watch their Now let me be clear: I don’t hate these companies at all: quite the opposite. I play DraftKings! I love that they are successful right now. When people try to discredit Uber, I laugh and cite the numerous ways they have improved quality of life. Companies like Uber and DK are what we young, humble startups aspire to be. They are our started-up heroes. We see them and think that maybe one day we can make it to being big companies, too!Uber, Snapchat, and recently DraftKings are the varsity athletes, the big brothers and sisters, the presidents of the senior class (or of the chess club, if you prefer). We startups are the middleschoolers, gazing at our elders, hoping for any sort of acknowledgment. We haven’t learned how to dress cool, look cool, or act cool. We probably never will! Those big fish were like us one day, and they can empathize with where we are. But they are a very different thing now.“Ok smartass, so what IS a startup?” Rather than define what is a startup, I think it is better to state what is probably no-longer a startup. Let me go Bizarro-Foxworthy for you:And if you aren’t a real startup, or are a news organization reporting on these companies, just do us little guys a favor and stay away from the word.

What a day it was — after months of having to navigate my way through the not-so-mean back streets of northern Mitte due to the ongoing roadworks, I was finally able to cycle straight down Veteranenstrasse and Invalidenstrasse all the way from the Zionskirche to Chausseestrasse, on which was located the office where I have been taking occasional refuge this year.There was something quite Berlin about this fact — and I don’t just mean because the road wasn’t actually open yet; it seemed possible to ride on it, ergo it was available for travelling upon according to the average Berliner.No, what struck me was that it was more than four years since I had first noticed the roadworks (that perhaps doesn’t do it justice; it was, to be fair, a significant project) which turned Invalidenstrasse into a jungle of one way, temporary streets, U-turning trams, walkways cobbled together out of sand and the occasional rotund worker dressed in hi-viz jacket and quizzical look.And on that occasion, in the long-gone days of 2011, I was on my way to what was just about the first interview I ever carried out for Silicon Allee. Back then, we were just a group of three friends who had decided to build something, a community, amongst the seeds of what was to become Berlin’s burgeoning startup scene. I was a part time freelance journalist, having enjoyed stints of various lengths at Bild and Spiegel. And I was hurrying through this new-found maze of roadworks to the office of ResearchGate, a small science-based tech company that was beginning to make waves, in Berlin at least.In the intervening years, Berlin, ResearchGate, and, if I say so myself, Silicon Allee have all blossomed and grown, or at least grown up.But the roadworks remained, a middle finger to the commuting man and a tribute to the never-say-finished attitude of public works in Germany’s capital. The more things change, the more they stay the same.Until this day, that is; the final day I would get on my bike and head to the office, deftly avoiding the tram tracks and slightly less lethal cars. This was a Friday, and on the Monday following, I was moving to Brussels for what can only be described — damn the hackery — as a new chapter in my life.And so my time with Silicon Allee was a journey bookended by work to improve the journeys of others, so to speak.The point here, though, is to consider how much has changed in those four and a half years. And much in Berlin has changed — although most of what makes it stand out as a city, why I instantly fell in love with the place, remains.The first time I ever came to Berlin was as part of a school trip when I was 15, in 1996. While it would have been wonderful to have truly experienced the city back then (just drop your nearest 15-year-old boy in a random city and see how they ‘experience’ it) it wasn’t until I returned at the end of 2006 that I was given the chance to get to know Berlin as an adult.I fell for its charms straight away, and moved out here in early January 2007, suitcase and six-month freelance contract clutched in my hand. Who knew how long it would last?Well, eight years, seven months and 25 days, apparently. A little longer than expected.The Berlin I arrived in was still a little rough around the edges; poor but sexy, although a rather over-played phrase, was certainly a true one back then. But the city has grown up in the intervening years as it bears increasing amounts of responsibility on a political and economic level in Germany and across Europe.Nowhere is this growth more obvious that in the technology sector. Berlin has always had an innovative and entrepreneurial side to it, and Internet-related companies have been built here continuously since the 1990s. But I like to refer to the massive upswing in activity since 2010 or so as the current incarnation of the city’s startup scene. Back in February 2011, when the first Silicon Allee breakfast meet up was held (at Sankt Oberholz, of course, on what was then a very different-looking Rosenthaler Platz), the ecosystem, if it can be called that, was limited to a relatively small group of people, who pretty much all knew each other.Since then, the amount of people involved in tech in Berlin has grown exponentially as wave after wave of new startups were founded. Many have failed — and what was interesting to me was how many of that first wave failed, and how that fact didn’t do anything to hinder Berlin’s headlong rush into becoming a global tech hub.Lessons were learned, and then put into practice. The survivors thrived on the ever-improving conditions for startups, and now the likes of SoundCloud and Delivery Hero (which was only founded in 2011) have become global players.But on top of the myriad tech companies now thriving in Berlin, there has been the growth of the ecosystem around it. Companies providing a variety of services for the tech sector have sprung up, and existing firms have increasingly turned their attention to startups. Now accountants are hoping to attract startups with all the appeal of a long-term relationship with a fast-growing company, while consultancy firms are selling the promise of making the process of building a startup easier.And the corporates have flooded in, some with more of an idea of what they are doing than others, to climb aboard the startup wagon. With them came a raft of accelerators and incubators; again, some more successful than others.But the money is where Berlin’s emergence as a tech hotspot is the most obvious. Back in 2011, it was difficult for a Berlin startup to attract serious funding, especially in the the city itself. Many of the serious players, above all in the US, still considered Berlin something of a backwater. No longer. Now the biggest and best of them are fully up-to-date with what is happening here, and willing to invest if they find the right company. That is perhaps the biggest win for the city and its burgeoning digital sector.No longer is Berlin just a cool place to live. It has become a more attractive place to found a startup than any other in Europe, perhaps aside from London (but is still, in my opinion, generally more liveable than the British capital), and there is still no sign that things are slowing down.I’ve always argued that Europe needs to function as a single entity when it comes to tech, and should have its different tech hubs complementing each other. I think that is happening, and I think that Berlin will ultimately be the most important centre of innovation and technology entrepreneurship outside of Silicon Valley.I’ll miss living in Berlin, but I will also be watching with interest as it develops. Silicon Allee will, as always, be right there to support and help the community, so stick with us — it’s going to be a helluva ride. And just like the M10 tram, which after four-and-a-half years of roadworks has been extended to the Hauptbahnhof, Berlin will be reaching further than ever — and ahem, remains firmly on track for future success. #alwaysendwithapunThe community-driven voice of startups and technology companies in Berlin.Curated essays from Berlin’s start-up scene.

I’m a crafter not a hoarder. I tell stories people wanna hear.

I read the handsome and brilliant As always, make your own mind up, and take my biased opinion for what it’s worth!(I borrow liberally from the original article).This one is easy. Take it. You’re just starting your career, and a startup is the absolute That’s why you should dive head-first into the deep end and immerse yourself in learning… at an actual job! Like a place where you’re the person people look to for your expertise! Rather than a place where you’re a commodity farmed out for slim-ass margins!To put it another way, do you learn more about design from sitting in class or working the internship? So… yeah. Apply that to life.You will most likely be on a very large team of designers, all of them with way more experience than you. Maybe one will have been there six years longer, which means he’s making barely any more money. And in a world where you have to watch your insanely tiny margins, he’s getting laid off first. So he’s not teaching you anything.You may be looking at the agency game since time immemorial: Let’s hire 200 designers and pump them for ideas and then leave them in the dust. Which is not unlike when the sea monkey company would send you a thousand sea monkeys, knowing that 900 would die within the first week.You’ll be pimped out to other companies who pay your agency for your time. Kind of like an escort. Except at least escorts get tips. You won’t get tips.Mike’s dead spot on mega right about this:He’s hilariously wrong about this:Mentors help you see the world from the perspective of someone who has gone through the challenges and ups and downs of a career that you hope to emulate. That’s why mentors are awesome.If you want to be stuck in a shitty agency, get a mentor from a shitty agency! Ditto for startups.The moral of this story is that you should find the right mentor for you, based on The only problem you will learn to solve at an agency is the client’s problem. And it may well indeed be a worthy problem to solve. But right now you need to be learning how to solve a wide variety of problems for a wide variety of people. You need to be trying different things. Dealing with different types of projects.From designing a logo to making that hackathon poster to designing the annual offsite t-shirt to rehauling the landing page… these are the kinds of projects you should be doing to go wide.Going deep? That’s spending 6 skull-crushing weeks on iterating on the same.fucking.packaging.design.As anyone who has ever worked in a startup (e.g. not Mr. Monteiro) will tell you, if there’s Working for pittance on razor thin margins at an agency. Ever. Like never ever.You might, just possibly, get rich at a startup.This is straight fact. Like, there is no possible way you can factually disagree. Poll 5 friends that work as designers at agencies and 5 friends who work as designers at startups on their salaries. Not including equity. Not including benefits. Just straight base $.Mike’s dead right about this. You will not be comfortable at a startup unless you can handle chaos and self-direction.However, let’s be real here. The stress induced by this chaotic environment is hardly worse than the stress of looming client deadlines, horrible client project managers and arbitrary and uninformed client decisions.Pick your poison. I take making my own decisions over trying to please a board of grey-haired old men any day.I don’t even know where to start with this one. Let’s leave it at this: do you It isn’t. If you want societal impact, choose a startup every single day of the week. You might want to look at, say, any industry that has ever existed, and see which side of history Mr. Monteiro is standing here.Pure gold.

Every Monday morning, I would fly out of Dulles Airport and crisscross the country to pitch my dream of a new, sustainable, home improvement store to potential investors. The weeks and months dragged on. The dream started to unravel.Investors committed, only to bail months later because the process was taking too long. My friends sent e-mails with subject lines like, “Are you alive???” It was even worse at home.A creeping separation had started to set in between my wife and me. We were spending too much time away from each other. Our love was icing over. Our lives were diverging, and I hated the direction in which mine was headed.I knew a lot about raising money. After college, I worked as an investment banker on Wall Street, where I sold mega-companies like Burger King to private equity firms. I had analyzed hundreds, if not thousands, of deals. When I left New York, I cofounded an angel investment group in DC. I knew what investors wanted because I was one of them. Every day I received e-mails from people looking for tips on fundraising. I was the fundraising guy.Then, a miracle happened. I got a call from Greg King, one of my investors. “TreeHouse needs to come off the shelf,” he said. He would help us raise the remaining $3 million. Within thirty days, we had closed the round.Sixty-three percent of today’s American twenty-somethings want to start a business. Whether it’s the next Facebook, the next world-changing nonprofit, or the next coffee shop down the street, starting something is the ambition of today’s generation.But here’s the dirty little secret: starting something is insanely hard.Three years ago, I set out with long-time friend and entrepreneur Evan Baehr to demystify one of the most intimidating parts of launching a venture: fundraising.There’s no shortage of advice on fundraising. Most of it is terrible.So, Evan and I got to work. We mentored dozens of first-time founders and interviewed angel investors, venture capitalists, directors of angel networks, heads of family investment offices, and CEOs of crowdfunding platforms. We took improv classes. We worked with some of the country’s biggest accelerators and angel groups, and sweet-talked fifteen successful entrepreneurs into letting us show you exactly what they did to raise money, including the pitch decks they showed investors. We’ve also raised over $45 million for our own ventures, including the second-largest round ever raised on the startup platform AngelList at the time. We did all of these things to answer one question: What does it really take to raise money?What we discovered is that the skill to raise the money you need, get expert feedback, and build partnerships isn’t just an X factor that some people have and others don’t. On the contrary, it can be decoded.There are specific habits and tools that aspiring entrepreneurs can cultivate to dramatically increase the likelihood that their ventures will succeed. Here are a few of them:Nearly every startup founder we interviewed had a “miracle” like the TreeHouse story you just read about — some unexpected occurrence that catapulted him or her into ultimate success. As we dug in, we discovered that these miracles weren’t really miraculous at all; they were the direct result of relationships the founders had nurtured earlier. In my own life, my friendship with Greg King caused Greg to put his own reputation on the line to help me close TreeHouse’s funding round.The secret to raising money is one simple principle: successful fundraisers don’t raise money, they raise friends.There needs to be more entrepreneurs raising wildly successful funding rounds. But even more than that, there needs to be entrepreneurs who build friendships that outlast any term sheet and create true value for them, their ventures, and their communities.Craft Your Story, Build the Perfect Pitch Deck, and Launch the Venture of Your Dreams

It’s actually a way to build team spirit and celebrate small successes, and enjoy the journey.As Anand Sanwal from CB Insights points out in So while it’s great for team morale, In his book So think about it.Whether you’ve got a gong or not, are you solely focused on hitting sales targets? What other measures of success could you celebrate?How about:At our recent As one attendee said:There were even group hugs…The most powerful source of purpose, and happiness, comes when we feel like we’ve worked on something that matters and made some positive impact not just to others, but to society as a whole.Focus on making the lives of your employees and customers better and the rest will take care of itself.Hope you enjoyed this post.

Finding the right startup to join is like looking for the right person to be in a relationship with: many possibilities, but few real options. My intermittent search in the past year has introduced me to many different ones, each with its own distinctive personality. I met them the same way anyone would meet a future partner: via mutual friends, acquaintances and matchmakers (yep—I’m not ashamed of it). Some of these interactions took place over email exchanges, some over coffee. Coffee dates led to trial dating periods. A few came very close to being the one with whom I could see a future.One of the first difficulties that I encountered was in defining what I am. I met many people who did not understand what is a UX designer (including designers themselves); that term meant different things to different people. Added to the confusion are the nuanced variations: interaction designers, UI designers, visual designers, graphic designers and web designers. In many discussions, I had to be explicit about what I do. For some, a designer meant someone who makes things look pretty. While that is part of what I do, it is a small part. For me, design is about how things work: I am interested in talking to people, diagnosing problems, creating potential solutions and making sure that the solutions are simple and easy-to-use. Much of that work does not involve selecting colors or typefaces or even pushing pixels on a screen; nor is it limited to web, desktop or mobile.At first, I always gave the disclaimer that I am not a visual designer because I can’t create icons and illustrations. This led me to undersell myself and invited people to doubt my abilities. Emphasizing my core strength led to the misunderstanding that my skills were limited to simply creating wireframes. My visual design style gravitates toward clean and simple interfaces, which led me to believe that I wasn’t good at visual design; that’s entirely wrong. My visual designs are just different—they enhance content instead of impressing people with their beauty. The most effective way that I found to communicate my abilities was in creating a portfolio of past projects. I was able to refer to it and be clear about the level of my skills with respect to the different parts of being a UX designer: user research, UI/interaction design, visual design and usability testing. Once I overcame this existential crisis and was able to coherently articulate what I do, it became a lot easier for me to identify potentially good matches.I’ve met startups that have clearly not worked with many designers before; for some, I would have been the first designer they’ve ever worked with. After being rejected many times for not being a visual designer who met their standards, I began to question my own design skills. Maybe my skills weren’t that great. Maybe I really needed to focus on making UIs that are exceptionally beautiful. All this agonizing was pointless. The reality was that they didn’t know what is a UX designer and were confused about what they needed. Some claimed they were searching for a UX designer, but when I probed, it became clear that they cared more about visual design and was looking for someone to make their products look great—if a young startup has a strong product manager (who isn’t a founder), that startup is most likely looking for a visual designer. I’ve also experienced the opposite where startups said they wanted a visual designer, but what they really needed was a UX designer. Besides not knowing what they needed, their inexperience also led them to have unrealistic expectations about what they could find in a potential partner.There are startups that want designers who can do everything: user research, UI/interaction design, visual design, usability testing, copywriting, front-end coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and some go as far as asking for back-end skills as well (usually Python or Ruby)—why not throw in product while we’re at it? I’m not even exaggerating. It’s understandable that a small startup would want its team members to be versatile and help out in different roles, but these expectations were extreme. This is equivalent to my looking for the perfect guy—a clearly futile attempt. Even if such a man existed, I’d be concerned about what I’d have to offer in return (not to mention the multitude of others who’d be clamoring for his attention). So even though my LinkedIn profile says “UX Unicorn” (it’s mostly intended as tongue-in-cheek) and while I do have these skills, it’s a lot to expect. Some wanted me to jump through hoop after hoop to prove myself worthy. After awhile, it became one too many hoops. There’s always a risk involved in committing to someone and it’s understandable that they wanted to be cautious, but there was a point where that caution became excessive. The constant struggle to prove myself was exhausting. Even though there was an initial attraction, in order to preserve my sanity, I had to say goodbye. Still, things could have been worse.One particular incident wins the prize for being the most awkward and uncomfortable. It began innocuously with questions about myself, what I’m looking for and vice versa. We did a QA surrounding how I would improve their product. What caught me by surprise was that they wanted me to show them the solution on-the-spot. As in, Photoshop was open and they expected me to mock it up as they watched (whiteboard sketches were not enough). I’ve done detailed design exercises with startups before, but they were never time-constrained with a live audience. If I had been on a real date and my date had asked me to rub his feet to show him that I knew how to give a massage, I couldn’t have been more surprised. Any possibility of a future relationship ended. The only thing I debated was how to hightail out of there without making a scene. Thankfully, not all of my dates were this ludicrous.Along with newbies, unicorn-hunters and wish-I-could-forget dates, I’ve also met great guys. One was extremely courteous and considerate and I felt very well-treated throughout our dates. While we were getting to know each other and assessing whether we’d be a good fit, I never felt like I had to jump through hoops—instead, I felt courted. It was a nice change. Although this startup was great, things didn’t end up working out because I wasn’t a good fit for them. Another reason where things didn’t work out with other startups was that I wasn’t excited about their mission, but that’s not always the case.There are companies that I’ve admired for a long time. These are rock stars with whom most people would have jumped at the chance to have a relationship—I was no different. I was giddy with excitement at getting the chance to just meet them and talk to them. I agonized over whether they would call, why they hadn’t called and what I was going to do if they didn’t. We went on a few dates, but in the end, I was not the one for them. They wanted someone who was…er…well…taller. I’m five feet and nearly a half-inch (yes, it counts). I tried to convince myself that I could wear high heels so I would be closer to their desired height. I made a half-hearted attempt to convince them. Deep down, I knew it wouldn’t have worked though. I hate high heels. So even though they rejected me, I wasn’t crushed for long that it didn’t work out. The ones that still haunt me are the ones that ended for no clear reason.Once in awhile, I fall hard for a startup. It was an auspicious beginning where we were both genuinely interested in each other. They were intriguing and exciting. I worried about whether or not I was good enough for them. We were open about ourselves: I knew they had been in bad relationships before—I’ve experienced my own share. What I didn’t expect was how deeply these experiences had scarred them. It was enough to make them extremely shy about committing.At the time when we were supposed to either commit or part ways, they proposed that we defer the decision and keep the relationship open longer. They wanted to be non-exclusive still? Really? They didn’t think I was good enough? On the one hand, it was entirely logical to take more time if they had made bad decisions in the past. On the other hand, I felt deeply rejected; I wondered if they had seen something that gave them pause. Being on the receiving end of the “It’s not you, it’s me” speech isn’t pleasant, regardless of how true it might be.Had they told me from the beginning that they would need more time than usual, I would have known what to expect. Their hesitation fueled my doubts and insecurities. Had those other relationships ended badly because the others didn’t measure up? Would I measure up? I deliberated and debated and when I was finally able to overcome the disappointment to consider extending the courtship, they had already moved on. Was it my ambivalence that was off-putting? Had they simply changed their mind? Whatever the reason was, I will never know. This relationship began with great hope, but ended with the guy never returning my call. My having fallen for them made recovering a difficult process. But as with any relationship, it just took a new one to recover from the old one.Strangely, sometimes things just work out. This startup took the prize for being the friendliest that I’ve ever dated. Many are nice, but not many are friendly. I felt comfortable in their presence even though we went through the same potentially awkward getting-to-know-you phase—they were actually reluctant to make me jump through hoops. It was frankly a relief after all the others. I didn’t feel the need to be anything other than what I am and, surprisingly, I am the person they’ve been looking for. After talking to more than a dozen startups in eight consecutive weeks, it was surreal to find one that appreciated me as I am and treated me well without demanding much in return. As it turns out, the one for me is the one that is good to me. As simple as that sounds, it was harder to find than you would think.During my intermittent search over the past year, I’ve talked to 30+ startups and learned how exhausting the process can be, mentally, physically and emotionally. Besides the disappointment that came with being rejected, I had to deal with so much unexpected baggage from their previous relationships. Their perception of me was colored by their own experiences and I had to learn not to internalize it as accurate reflections of myself. In the past, I’ve had a knack for attracting partners who turned out not to be good for me so I have my own hesitation in selecting a future partner. Each startup has its own dysfunction (ahem—quirks). I’ve just tried to find ones that I can live with. Will we live happily ever after? Well, that’s another story.A mischievous iconoclast — I walk my own line.Life is made of stories.

One year ago, I made a bittersweet decision to leave Goldman Sachs after 8 years. Although it was difficult to leave an incredibly talented and genuinely nice team, I was excited to join an equally awesome one at When making my decision, I wasn’t 100% sure what to expect or how the culture would be different. Now, one year in, I wanted to share what I’ve learned  experienced to anyone who’s either contemplating making or recently made a similar move. Some of what I discuss below will naturally be colored by my job function (engineering/product), but I think a lot of it applies no matter your role.The ethos of any start-up boils down to finding a new or better way to do something. There’s a myth that a start-up is solely based on one game-changing idea. While it’s certainly the foundation, it’s the 1,000 imagined and executed ideas cobbled on top of it that transform it to a viable product. You’ll be empowered to dream, prototype and if successful, bake it into the product right away. Remember, failure is encouraged, as long as it’s cheap.You don’t know what exactly your users want or sometimes, who they even are. Finding your way out of this darkness is an exercise in trial-and-error to begin to zig-zag your way towards the light. An idea that pops into your head on Monday gets shipped Friday, you learn from what happens, and build on top of it. Six month roadmaps or Q4 plans usually don’t exist in this world. Every week is its own challenge — make sure you enjoy the little victories and perhaps more importantly, not get dissuaded by the little failures that come along the way.As you become more senior in the engineering world at a large company, the best way to scale is to focus on the big picture and delegate the implementation. However, at a smaller organization, I believe you have to also be very much involved in building the product: 1) Engineers who can’t help with an implementation or debug a problem in a pinch are liabilities to the company, and 2) with an inherently flatter hierarchy, leadership and consensus aren’t primarily derived from seniority, but respect. Respect amongst developers equates to the knowledge that if given the time, you could build it from scratch. That’s earned, not given.Going through hundreds of emails a day have now become only a memory for me. The latest enterprise workplace messaging applications allow you to be super efficient about intra-office communication. Email, by definition, implies that you have one shot at conveying your message to a likely diverse group of people with different vantage points. Tools like Slack allow you to be direct, to the point, and iteratively have a conversation if there are follow-ups — all in a matter of minutes. Long live My personal experience working at large companies is that the moment you walk into work, you transport to a more silo-ed mindset that’s focused on solving specific problems using specific tools without a huge amount of regard for the outside world. The startup environment, however, lives on the opposite end of the spectrum. It’s conducive to making sure you stay on top of all the interesting and innovative things that are happening in the world. Whether it’s an insightful investor interview or just being privy to a brand new app trying to solve a problem in a unique way, it’s stuff that you probably weren’t cognizant of before but now just have better access to. Personally, one of the most enjoyable aspects of being at a startup is the general feeling of being more in “the know” in the tech world — I think you’ll enjoy it too.Starting your own company is hard — we all know that. However, it begins to feel impossible the longer you’re at a large company. Beyond the product, there are so many other things to solve that you may feel you have no idea where to even begin, having been previously insulated from them: finance/funding, operations, hiring, office space, technology infrastructure, the list goes on. Working at a startup teaches you how your founders have solved for these problems. If starting a company is a dream of yours, working at a startup is a really valuable stepping stone to take.Please don’t hesitate to reach out and ask me any questions (find me at Funny and Cool

When I accepted the offer to join Yogurt Labs, I knew things will change a lot. It will change the way I work, the way I look at things, the way I deal with problems and the tools I use in my daily professional life.There are many tools which I use but 5 stands out from rest. There is a surprise for you in the video I made for this post, watch it to know.

In any business, it’s difficult to retain every single one of your customers — nobody bats a thousand, no matter how good the product is. But don’t get discouraged!Their departure brings valuable insight to improve your systems from start to finish, and helps prevent this common occurrence.And you may even be able to save them from leaving altogether (if it’s valuable for you both).It’s pretty straightforward: They’re not getting enough value from your product . . . or not enough Now you can break down these customers into two categories:If you’re a B2B SaaS startup, and the company is going out of business so saving them as a customer is impossible. (We won’t focus on this group, but this scenario is still educational: perhaps re-approach your marketing and target more successful companies etc.)There’s a window here, so use it to boost value for them, but more importantly, discover what you can change as a business/product/service to prevent future customers from jumping ship. Now in a perfect world, you already have instruments in place to flag you when service falls short, e.g., infrequent logins or abnormally low usage. That way you preemptively intervene, stepping in before this last, possible moment.And we’ll show you how to do that. But first, let’s discuss In these situations, reaching out to people is uncomfortable — customers are unhappy, impatient, and eager to move on to “something better”. But there’s powerful, beneficial knowledge to be gained from this group that your prospective market will never tell you.For this type of info, you need customers that have already been through the doldrums, not fresh honeymooners.Here’s a list of what you have to gain:Ok, you know So how should you go about contacting people as they’re on their way out?Easy. Call them. You’re already good at that, so If you can’t get them on the horn? Send an email. Reach out so they know they’re valued, even if they’ve already set sail with a different service.All in all, you must ascertain 4 crucial pieces of information:Here’s a simple script that will get you off on the right foot:This is a great way to begin. Then, based on what they tell you, ask questions to dive deep and really understand what happened.If your product couldn’t fulfill their needs, find out what can be done about it. (Important!) Don’t cut them off before you fully understand the problem. Submerge entirely in their pain and restrain from spiking the fact that your product actually But if it Or maybe, they need a function that isn’t yet implemented, And when they do discover that you still offer what they want — and it would be of mutual benefit for them to stay — then make a compelling pitch for why they should!Touch on the-grass-is-greener trap. Typically, the sentiment exists that a shiny, new, solve-all product is right around the corner; but in reality, every product is a little messy. So simply highlight what’s important about the relationship you’ve already built:After you hit them with those, finish with this:Like I said, you won’t be able to save them all, but that’s hardly the main idea. It’s about learning from your mistakes so you can reduce your shortcomings — across the board — and prevent future bailouts.And if you discover that you can’t provide what they need — can’t bring them success with your product — then don’t try to keep them! Because they’re going to churn eventually, and they’ll be even So act in their best interest. It’s the right thing to do, for everyone.Reaching out to these churning customers will help you discover what it is about your business that you can maintain, or change, from beginning to end.Once in awhile, you’ll get an opportunity to win them back as customers by revisiting the value in your product that they may have missed, and that If not? Don’t sweat. Even if you can’t convince them to stay, you’ve still learned something truly valuable . Take that feedback and bring it into the product (marketing, sales, support) so you can be more successful with it in the future.By adjusting and adapting your product through the failures it’s had with your customers, you’ll get real-world feedback from people who have a need for your product and tried it, and this will help you to build a better product and mature as a company in your marketplace.

There is more and more literature about the trending A startup studio is a structure that aims at building startups. They can also be called Startup factory, Company Builder or Foundry. Even though there can be different models and philosophies, according to me there are 3 elements that define a startup studio:Ideas should be generated internally; startup studios are not early stage investors but actual co-founders. The studio should originally own 100% of the project idea.Building many companies in a row should remain the main goal of startup studios.The studio should own an infrastructure made of pooled resources: talented people, serious processes, useful tools and a strong network. A studio should not be just an empty structure owning a portfolio of companies.Building companies through a startup studio creates many advantages coming from the studio’s infrastructure:(and how we dealt with them at eFounders)At eFounders, we focus on building independent companies: after 18 to 24 months, all of our startups become fully independent and we do not play any operational role anymore. If one of our startups becomes a breakout hit, we’ll simply be very happy board members.It is a common mistake to imply that providing a structure entails killing innovation, although it makes no sense: providing a structure only entails being structured. There is only one way to be visible above the mass: be innovative. That’s what we do. Our main methodology is to include “having crazy ideas” as one of the top requirements we impose in our team.No, I never stop ☺ Every time I face an issue when I work, I have a startup idea. As long as there are problems, there will be product ideas.We understand it is an important risk when building startups. That is why we’ve built our studio around the idea that we build independent startups, with their own founders, team and more generally, culture, which impacts our methodologies and cap tables.In reality they are very few studios that are focusing on building companies, period. Many structures calling themselves “startup studio” are, in fact, hands-on investors. They use the studio workforce to assist companies of their portfolio. These companies can be very early-stage, in that case it is a form of pro-active incubation, or more mature, which I call consolidation.We have been building a list of “Startup Studio” (and close equivalents) Here are 2 examples of Startups Studios according to the definition provided. These startup studios have very different philosophies but work basically on the same model.Learn more about Founder A startup studio is a structure whose aim is to repeatedly build companies, thanks to its infrastructure and resources.

Nicole is known for the #100DaysOfThankYouCards challenge where she wrote thank you cards for 100 consecutive days. She streams in a variety of interesting formats, like #MotivationMonday, #TEDtalkTuesday, #HotChocolateFriday, #StyleSaturday, and many others. Today she’s our #FeaturedFriday.Nicole was on Season 10 of The Apprentice with Donald Trump and was 4th Runner-Up to miss California USA pageant. We learned more about what those experiences were like as well as some of her most memorable moments on Meerkat!I’m an intellectual property attorney turned stylist, front-end web developer and startup operations guru — basically, I’m a Jill-of-all-Trades! I’m the COO and co-founder of The Apprentice was an amazing YOLO kind of experience. My one objective was to be true to myself through the whole experience and I was — I didn’t scream or curse in the Board Room. I empowered the other women on my team to take ownership of parts of our project. I volunteered to be the leader the first week. And yes, that may have lead to my firing… but it was true to me. I’m a leader and I will always step up when given the opportunity to lead.My experience on The Apprentice was just me embodying what I truly believe : you have to put yourself out there — you have to risk big — you have to dream big… and if you fail, what’s the worst that can happen? For me, it was being fired in front of millions (it was the most watched episode of that season!) of people on TV….. eh, no biggie, right? ;) Actually, it was one of the best things that ever happened to me.The first day Meerkat launched, my husband I’ve had many! I’ve cried on my streams on many occasions, because I’ve been so moved by my followers and because I try to be real about how I’m feeling. Another “aha” moment was hitting 600 viewers at the same time on one stream! Nobody wanted to leave when we were so close to 400, then we got close to 500 and everyone stayed, and then we reached 600 and Getting recognized on the street was also an “aha” moment was when I was recognized by someone on the street while streaming — he was actually watching my stream and then walked by me and held up his phone — it was crazy!There were a lot of great moments in those streams. This year was actually my second year writing 100 Days of Thank You Cards, although the first year doing it together with people on the stream. Each stream I start by explaining why we’re writing thank you cards, which I think really helps with new viewers and followers tuning in. At first I thought it might get repetitive… but my regular viewers told me that hearing my description of the 100 day challenge to write a thank you card was pivotal to the stream being meaningful for them.Many viewers would ask how I could “find” 100 people to thank — but it’s really not hard when you think about all the people you have in your life helping you do what you do and be who you are. Over the course of the 100 days, I started writing thank you cards to some of my Meerkat viewers — those were some of the most memorable thank you card streams because the people watching had come to know the person I was writing to and sometimes the recipient was watching as I wrote his or her card.I wrote cards to family and friends, but it was the cards I wrote to those I met solely through Meerkat that were the most memorable — because it went full circle — I met them through my #100DaysofThankYouCards streams and then thanked them for all their support and belief in me. I thanked them for contributing to our community and for their encouragement. I thanked them for being good people. I began signing off of my #100DaysofThankYouCard streams with hand gestures I created for #blessed and #grateful because I just felt so blessed and grateful to have my Meerkat community and be a part of this incredible, powerful movement.Other memorable thank you cards I wrote/streamed were those I wrote to the people in my life that I’m not on the best terms with, but would like to be. I think it was Meerkat, my followers and the 100 days that got me to the point of realizing that I wanted to let go of bad feelings and focus on the reasons I should be grateful for all the people in my life and my family, even those that I find challenging sometimes. Over the 100 days, I felt like I became a better person.I’ve experimented with different types of streams and have learned what works for my community. Now, I am confident in the streams that I do on a regular rotation — we have #MotivationMonday, #TEDtalkTuesday, #ThankYouCardThursday, #HotChocolateFriday, and #StyleSaturday.I love #MotivationMonday because it’s when I check in with my #Meerfamily and hold them accountable for the goals they set. Cameos are popular during this stream and it’s really awesome to hear about how their lives are changing as the weeks pass and they make progress toward their goals. I write down every goal that every viewer shares with me and I check in with them whenever they join me in my stream. It means a lot to me to be able to support them in achieving their goals, whatever they may be. And they hold me accountable too! #TEDtalkTuesday is all about continuing to learn, grow and be open to new ideas/opinions/points of view. We started with #30DaysofTEDtalks to kick it off — but we continued because I feel like there is so much we can learn from #TEDtalks (which are free) and from the knowledge / expertise of others. I watch so many #TEDtalks to curate select the TED Talk we are going to watch each week. We watch as a group and then discuss what everyone got from the talk afterwards, via cameo. I had one regular viewer who said he never realized he was a feminist until he watched my stream. I can’t think of a better reason to stream.#ThankYouCardThursday is something that we really came up with during a stream — because when #100DaysofThankYouCards ended, it just felt like something was missing. So we decided that Thank You Cards should be written every week, that way we can continue introducing people to the habit of being grateful for the people in our lives and expressing that gratitude. In fact, due to popular demand… I’ll be designing (during a few streams, of course!) a line of Thank You cards that I’ll be selling for people to gift at the holidays and spread the #100DaysofThankYouCards movement!A lot of my regular streams are somewhat “heavy” or serious, so I like to interject some fun and lightness with #HotChocolateFriday, #StyleSaturday, my morning walk AMA streams, my cooking and baking streams, and all the random “Truman Show” type of streams like when I go to the hair salon to get a blow out. During #HotChocolateFriday, I invite my friends to experience Meerkat with me and we do blind taste tests of different hot chocolates, marshmallows, and whipped cream.Whenever anyone asks me for advice, the first thing I say is to be yourself. I think that’s how I keep my stream so positive — because I am a naturally positive person. What’s great is that, as a result, my community is so positive and when I’m having a moment of negativity or feeling down I can stream to help me get through it.I think we created the “emoji roll call” — which is when everyone comments one emoji and it changes their profile picture to that emoji. I think it’s super fun to see everyone engaging and picking an emoji to share. We do emoji roll to say happy birthday to people, to celebrate when people achieve a goal, to welcome new viewers to Meerkat and for pretty much every occasion I can think of :) Some of my followers (Oh… and another thing I do to keep it fun and positive while we discuss such serious topics….. the faces I do! When we get to 50 viewers at the same time, I do Elvis Face. When we get to 100 viewers at the same time, I do Fishface. At 250, I do Duckface. And at 500 viewers at the same time, I do all 3 faces cross-eyed! Then when we hit 600 (it’s only happened once!), I cameo in a viewer to make a face of their own! It’s silly, I know, but it keeps it fun and it’s goofy — just like me.You can Live Stream Video

Right now my earbuds are in, and my music is turned up so loud I can feel my spine shaking. Not because I’m angry or sad, but because I’m determined. I’m determined to put to rest the jaded notions that surround music startups, even if it takes me more than one post to do it.I The article, though written I’m sure with the best of intentions at shining a light on the challenges of music startups in the tech arena, is fraught with generalizations and assumptions, none of which are good to have for an objective point of view. The piece referenced a talk from Google User Experience Researcher In his talk, which the piece points to, are six main points about executing the wrong plan, and how this dynamic seems to plague numerous founders. By the author’s own admission, the talk wasn’t focused on music startups, and the resulting analysis is just a series of personal views. The application of these points to the large deadpool of failed music startups is understandable. After all, it makes sense to look at a slew of failed projects and calculate the correlation and causation of their respective deaths. However, the piece takes too much latitude in my opinion, casting a shadow on all future music startups for the sake of bolstering a (misleading) argument in the present.Here are my responses to the six points in the talk and, subsequently, in the article (the asserted points are paraphrased for the sake of simplicity):This has nothing to do with the passion that music startup founders have for music. It has to do with their ability to dissect an industry that they have come to know better than most, and be able to see room for innovation within it. The generalized statement that “most people don’t care as much about music as you do” is misleadingly false.It first assumes that the founder cares too much about music, or is in the same way too in love with music so as not to be able to strategize accordingly. Secondly, it presumes to know what the music founder has in mind for an innovation, and already moves to the assumption that such an innovation will fail. Lastly, it presumes to generalize peoples’ unique affections for music without citing any real statistical proof.People do care about music — in fact, they care a lot. That’s the reason that Napster was such a snafu in 2000, and the reason that the music space will be the next crowded arena as numerous companies try to cut their own niche. People do care, each person at a varying degree, so how can one possibly know that “most people don’t care as much as you do”?I am a music startup founder, but my social circles are filled with people who populate the music, tech, theater, science, medical, and legal fields. Therefore, to reduce my social circles down to individuals who “think like I do” is fairly pandering and presumptuous.The author’s use of the company Jukely as a buttress for the argument actually brings into question the author’s own view of the music industry. The analysis is filled with wild generalizations like “[t]he live music audience [is mostly] made up of people in their twenties” and that “many people [can’t stay out late and see music because] they have a career and kids to think about.”The former is false because it’s a gross generalization (and assumption, for that matter), of the age-range of all music-goers everywhere, failing to take into account different music scenes, tastes, geographical dynamics, or any number of other factors. The latter is negated (and thereby false) because it presumes to know the intra-familial and career dynamics, realities, and responsibilities of all music-goers everywhere. As a result, the whole analysis can’t be put forward in any sort of objective way, and must therefore be taken as a matter of opinion, not a matter of fact.In the midst of arguing point 4, the author makes a bold statement that I can personally bear witness to as wholly false. The author writes: “The other risk startups take when entering the music space is that they simply don’t know anything about the music business.”Though the author does make a good point — that the “launch first, ask questions later” approach isn’t suited well to the music industry — the point is negated by the assumption that all music startup founders are simply overzealous music fans with no understanding of the inner workings of the music business. I, for one, take offense to that.I was in a band in high school, and after graduating, took a gap year before college, during which I was a music journalist. I continued my journalism well into my college career, even as I simultaneously ran a radio show and conversed with artists daily. In fact, I had press access at Warped Tour in 2012 precisely because of the connections I’d made and things I’d learned during my tenure as a journalist and DJ. All of these experiences and understandings are what I draw on every day to help formulate the best decisions for my music startup.The former of the statements asserts that no music founder could ever possibly create a music app or service people want/need, and the latter elevates SXSW to the pinnacle of godhood in the realm of music festivals. Yet, if the author was familiar with the trends and grumblings that go on below the surface, then it would be understood that SXSW has in fact become sour to many independent music fans in recent years, as it leans further towards a mainstream agenda.The last paragraph in particular is annoyingly pandering; its tone and diction betray a bitter and jaded writer using generalizations to bolster arguments of arrogance and assumptions.Which brings us back to the last sentence yet again: “Passion is great, but in the end, it often fades.” Clearly the author is surrounded by other jaded personalities who forgot (or perhaps never knew) why most people get into the music business in the first place. It’s not about being the next Led Zeppelin or being rich and famous (though it’s fun to entertain fantasies); it’s because our passion is visceral — a part of us that we can’t turn off and on at will. It just exists as a nagging need, like the need to breathe when we wake up in the morning.Passion can transform or ebb, but it rarely fades in the way that the author asserts it does. In the end, many of us in the music industry chose this business not because we wanted to solve some major problem (not at first); we chose it because it speaks to us in a way few other things do. That passion doesn’t fade. If anything, it gets stronger with every subsequent experience.Brandeis grad // Lover of Art, Poetry, Startups, Music, Journalism // Tech Founder and Deadpan HumoristAn ear for the new, a heart for the classics.

First you have to know this wasn’t an 1. Going back to May, I’ve followed 2. Twitter stroke the ego — I don’t remember which Outside of trying to get on Jason’s radar through Twitter, I’ve also tried to add some value to the Launch Scale conference. I call these Find Ways to Add Value And Get Attention:1. Tweet speaker and demo company recommendations — when they asked I sent Jason and the Launch Scale team a few recommendations for speakers or demo companies.2. When Jason sent out a pre-conference email with a link to the wrong conference (Mobile, 3. Be helpful to your peers — I did my best to be an active Slack participant as soon as it was launched which including responding to people, connecting with some(ex: those with a Midwest connection), etc.4. On Sunday night I made sure to send a Thank You to each of the Launch Scale Partners on Twitter. Thanks again 5. So this is the one you know since it was the one that broke through. I took high-level notes in the Launch Scale Slack channel. Normally I tweet this type of stuff out as much as I can at conferences, but as Jason asked to keep the content here and no press, I threw it all in Slack in hopes it would be helpful to other attendees. And now I’m the guy that was taking notes and got upgraded to the VIP pass.6. Even after getting moved up, I stayed active and worked hard to ask questions for the speakers in Slack — stay engaged! Side note: there were only 5–7 of us asking the questions every time Jason asked for them. Jump in!7. Finally I made sure to send a Thank You to the speakers on Twitter for sharing their content and stories.So what could you do on day 2 (or at your next conference) to out hustle me and get your own upgrade and invite to the VIP pass??? Because you best believe I’ll be working for another VIP dinner invite today, but I can’t do it all. So here are some of my ideas to add value:1. Write a recap on Medium of Day 1 at the conference with the best piece of knowledge/nugget of wisdom you took from each speaker — get Jason’s approval first since this is a closed event, but I bet he would love someone to help communicate the value of the conference and give a sneak-peek behind the curtain without giving it all away. I mean this is far and away the best conference I’ve ever attended so there should be a lot of highlights to write about.2. Make yourself the unofficial photographer of Launch Scale. Take a few pictures of the speakers and the halls during talks, take pictures of people meeting and connecting anywhere and everywhere, get one of every booth in the demo pit engaged with attendees and tag them in a tweet, take pictures of the gorgeous location in and around Fort Mason. Tweet em, Instagram them, blog them, post them all over the web. Sure everyone else has an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy in their pockets, but be the one that does something different with it to add value.3. Write a short blog post recommending the best things to do with your 1-2 hour Launch Scale breaks or evenings. Where to eat lunch, grab dinner, best thing to do with one free hour. Offer value to the attendees. Make yourself the conference Scout Travel guide so to speak. Better yet organize a dinner in Slack around a common theme (see Midwest area founders, those in the B2B sales space, etc.)4. Offer speakers a free Uber ride to the airport after their session via Twitter. Most are killing it with their businesses and as such can’t stay long and head to the airport soon after they present on the stage. Do Jason and Ashley and the rest of the A+ Launch team already have rides for them covered? Without a doubt! But you never know when one might respect your hustle and say sure, and boom you’ve got 30–60 minutes in the back seat of a car to connect with someone who has made it enough to be speaking at the event.5. Speaking of the kick ass Launch Scale team, ask Ashley or another team member if they need any last minute volunteers to do something. Shit happens during a conference and something unexpected ALWAYS happens. “Need an extra set of hands Launch team? Come grab me when you do.” Who knows, maybe you’ll end up manning the checklist at the VIP dinner that night or carrying Jason’s fresh cup of coffee or tea up on to the stage.6. Respond to all of Jason’s haters on Twitter with some knowledge bombs on what’s really going on at the conference. Jason posted in the Slack chat some guy that was trying to misrepresent attendance and engagement of the conference on Twitter. Take up the Launch Scale flag and explain to him and others how wrong he is.7. Take better notes or different notes than that So what did I do once I hustled my way to the VIP dinner last night? I hustled some more of course! I connected directly with 7 of the speakers at the party, 5 from day one (3 of which I attended, 2 I missed on the other stage) and 2 from day two. I sent a few tweets out based on the conversations we had and hopefully connected with each of them enough so that when I reach out via LinkedIn or Twitter they’ll connect and even more so, hopefully when I travel nearby them (3 were NYC, 3 were near the Bay Area, and one was LA) the next time I might at least have a chance to grab a coffee/lunch/happy hour if their schedule allows. Additionally I’ll follow up with each of them in the next month or two with more ways I can try and add value with each of them, such as potential synergies we might have discussed at the dinner, relevant news articles to their sector/space, and even a business idea or two they could run with.So what are you waiting for, hit that I came, I saw, I was curious.

You don’t often get to meet a co-founder of a startup that follows, by all means, the “perfect successful startup” path. And by “perfect startup”, I mean the kind of startup that goes by the book. And by “the book”, I mostly mean Paul Graham’s essays.I met Here you go. Perfect startup story. Which is even more surprising is that when I asked Alexandre: I was more looking for a “don’t be desperate, there are downsides behind all this, success The story of Alex as an entrepreneur started in 2002, when he decided to launch It took VirtuOz’s team 3 whole years before landing their first client, in 2005: VoyagesSncf.com, the biggest online travel agency in France — it was their lucky year and also raised $1,6M. In 2007, they decided to move to the U.S to explore business opportunities as they realized the French market was too small — the tech team remained in France. They soon realized that selling a product to AOL, Ebay, and other big players required much more than a nice product: you need to have a local data center, a 24h/24 customer support, huge sales teams, etc.Nevertheless, VirtuOz managed to raise a round of funding of $12M in August 2008 — literally days before the fall of Lehman Brothers — with Silicon Valley investors. Because the new company’s scale required more structured operations and financial reporting to investors, and because Alex felt more like focusing on the product, he decided it would be wiser to hire a “professional” CEO.His feeling was that the “Eric-Schmidt model” at Google was a smart one and they could make it work at VirtuOz — which he ended up realizing: what works at Google doesn’t necessary elsewhere. There was a huge mismatch between the newly appointed CEO — and the VPs brought along — in terms of culture and product understanding. As VP of Advanced Technology, Alex realized that he was no longer in power and did not feel he belonged in his own company — he took a year-long sabbatical, after which the board re-appointed him as CEO, in June 2012.In the meantime, the culture had already changed and what he left a “startup” had turned a 70-people company selling enterprise software. Alex decided to reorganize the team and launch a new product which ultimately lead him to sell VirtuOz to Nuance Communications in January 2013.After the acquisition, and after he made sure the transition went smoothly, Alex went back on track and decided to launch a new venture, focusing on an issue he witnessed: on the one hand, there was a huge demand for machines’ comprehension of human language (written and spoken), on the other hand, there were only custom solutions made for big companies (with big costs). What is there was an API for developers that could give them the capacity to understand human language?After spending ten years building and growing VirtuOz, Alex launched Wit.ai — a fully open API for voice recognition and language understanding, based on machine learning, and inspired by open models like Stripe and Twilio. He started coding it with his co-founder The first thing that Alex did completely differently is that he did not spend a second on unnecessary tasks. He and his co-founder spent 6 months coding, period. Their company was not incorporated, had no office and no money, even when they applied to Y Combinator.In his previous ventures, Alex lost an incredible amount of time in paperwork, renting offices, trying to raise funds before even having a single client — a mistake he would not replicate.Similarly, he had waited much too long for a perfect product before looking for his first users. With Wit.ai, he forced himself — and his co-founder — to launch the product as soon as possible on HackerNews. It was an alpha version, far from what they would be satisfied with, but operational.Wit.ai remained on HN’s homepage #1 position for 24 hours and they became a small phenomenon in the Valley, and by the time they applied to Y Combinator, they already had 3,000 developers using the API.When building a SaaS product, it is very tempting to sign major contracts with big players early on: it gives financial comfort, you feel it gives you business legitimacy, and it’s kind of flattering. That’s what Alex did with VirtuOz, and he learned not to do it again: when your SaaS startup is still young, you need to focus on building your own product. Larger accounts will ask for many custom features, a fully dedicated account manager, and ultimately distract you from building a scalable product that can be used by anyone.That’s why, when Wit.ai launched and Alex got meeting requests from big players, he refused in order to focus on building his product. With VirtuOz, he spend entire days with tech consulting firms without making a single dollar. With Wit.ai, he would rather debug 1 indie developer on the other end of the world for hours if it meant making the product better, than working with a multi-national.Alex was so convinced of his vision that he wanted to build a startup truly used by millions that he would rather fail than becoming a consulting business for big customers. According to him, Surprisingly — for me! — Alex remains pretty certain that you can start your startup from anywhere and do not need to be in the Valley from day 1. According to him, it’s all a matter of personal context. He could never have started VirtuOz in the U.S in 2002, and launching in France had its advantage at the time: he was able to raise €100k with family and friends, which would have been impossible in the Valley. The recruitment was made much easier, especially for tech profiles.When he launched Wit.ai, he already was in Palo Alto, which of course, also had its advantages. For instance, when he launched on HN, he asked in the comments if anyone could welcome him and his co-founder to their office, as they working from home. 10 min later, the founder of Pebble offered them 2 desks, to use Pebble’s office, network, snacks, meeting rooms etc. for free, and Wit.ai stayed here for 6 months, until it was a 6-engineer company!There are many tactical mistakes you can make when your startup has offices both in the US and France, says Alex. For instance, having a modern, powerful teleconference system in every meeting room is key. It’s also important to have people from both offices travel to the other office from time to time, in order to build personal relationship that will prove important in stressful times. But these tactical mistakes don’t impact the broader vision.From those lessons learned, Wit.ai followed an impressive path and ultimately got acquired by Facebook. While Alex was constantly refusing meetings with the corporate development teams of potential acquirers, when David Marcus (i.e Facebook Messenger lead and previously CEO of Paypal) contacted him, he accepted the meeting, which led to the deal. For Wit.ai, Facebook was a great opportunity to work with an incredible A.I research team, great resources, and a much larger scale, says Alex. The acquisition was announced on January 5, 2015, and Alex has since remained head of Wit.ai which still exists inside Facebook with a team of 10 engineers. They strongly contributed to the debut When you look at the story of Wit.ai in hindsight, the crazy 21-months startup success took Alex a decade of entrepreneur experience — and a great co-founder, he adds — to build. It is because Wit.ai is a product built by expert founders, passionate about their fields, who put their product in the hands of users very early on and solved a real issue, that it was so successful.Thanks Alex for this great lesson of humility and hard work!#startup + #web + #contentmarketingBi-monthly stories about code, tech and shared experiences.

“Early-stage fundraising is 20% fact and 80% spectacle, a magic show performed to convince, seduce, entice to follow a game changing vision and world changing riches. As someone who is non-binary and transgender, I learnt to dress and act neutrally, to sustain the magic circle of enchantment. I bound my budding breasts and wore baggy black clothing in sweltering summer heat, fabric layers as hot and oppressive as the identity performed. This magic circle was sustained, but narrowly. Always on the horizon edge, was the potential of a breakdown.It’s an additional weight, being a founder. The founding team is a crucial component in the startup narrative, which must be represented in heroic, epic and relatable terms. “It’s easier to pitch, to tell a story and present your product with one clear personal identity. My nebulous genderfluid and non-binary trans identity was difficult for people to understand, much less empathize and relate with. Besides, how else can you tell a 30 sec elevator pitch? The entire format, the magic show, is based on distilled soundbites made simple with helpful stereotypes. The hardest part was the transition period, the (git)merging of identities conflicting online and in person into a single, easily swallowable story. Still, there’s an awkward air when friends and acquaintances from separate life-spheres collide into a combustion of pregnant pauses, long silences and no eye contact.Even though investors and other connections were more receptive now, there was still the problem of appearances, and being relatable. It was a structural problem, where the top tier investors tended to invest in those like them, and as such, this homogeneity restricted the flow of capital to a larger, more diverse community of entrepreneurs. After all, there’s only so many people who can look like you, talk like you, go to the same school and work in the same few companies that “everyone” goes to. As you move down the capital stream to smaller funds, you can see more diverse funding sources open up.My co-founder and I did our best to find like-minded individuals, angels or venture funds.After I moved away from being gender ambiguous, I unbound myself and started presenting as a queer woman. I reached out to many LGBTQ* startup allegiances for help with fundraising. That was where I met more hostility than ever before.Every community has an extremist cell. Unfortunately for lesbians, whom I identify with, one loud vocal minority known as Trans Exclusive Radical Feminists (TERFs) overwhelm the 99.8% that are amazing people.Ideologically, TERFs believe in the classic gender binary, female and male. They don’t accept transgender or any non-binary gender identity. They are particularly hostile towards transgender women for what they believe is appropriation and exaggeration of the feminine. They’ve fought hard to re-define femininity away from this stereotype and see trans women as reinforcing it.To some degree it’s understandable, since newly self-realized trans women tend to go towards an extreme form of femininity to “pass” as women. This performance of hyperfemininity can be read wrongly especially in a delicate situation. At the same time, trans women need to adopt feminine signifiers to blend in and lead a normal life, else they risk being questioned, harassed, threatened in their daily lives. Trans women tend to be disproportionately targeted by hate groups, and they would feel despair and terrified if they can’t “pass” in general society.There’s so much micro-aggression against being trans that it’s hard to recall specifics. One incident sticks to my mind, and that was my first lesbian tech meetup. I remember how excited I was, discovering meetups dedicated to lesbians and queer people, whom I identified with, their front page proclaiming how this was a new type of tech meetup, one that was open and embracing diversity, a safe space and alternative way to the typical Silicon Valley “bro-sphere”.The evening started great. I met other startup founders, and exchanged stories with them. It felt good to be able to express myself, and talk about the startup and product without worrying. One investor seemed especially interested. She was connected to a large funding network, she said, one of the LGBTQ* friendly ones.The questions started simple. Who we were, what was our space, what was our product and how it fit the market. I was prepared for those. Then it started getting personal, more strange. You’ve accomplished a lot, she said, how did you do all that I guess she did think it was important. I guess I should’ve mentioned it sooner. I guess she was shocked, or angry. I guess she felt cheated, that I had “fooled” her. I wouldn’t know, because she never connected back to me. Nothing. 5 emails, 3 Linkedin connect requests, 2 tweets, 2 Angelist requests and 1 warm introduction from another angel group later, still nothing. Just absolute silence.Such silence, while hurtful, wouldn’t matter as much if it didn’t affect a large number of entrepreneurs. TERFs partially control many LGBTQ* startup funding groups, such as the investor I met at the lesbian and queer tech meetup. When I met them or some cases video-chat across the country with them, they read me as cis-lesbian. However, when the conversation continued or due diligence started and we went into our personal backgrounds, they’ll inevitably discover the trans part. Instantly, the conversation stops. No more meetings. No more emails. I’ve gone through this process before, but never so abruptly and unprofessionally from anyone else. Even the most tech bro-iest of bros, and that’s saying a lot!We like to believe that one kind of openness begets another, and that one call for diversity, creates more willingness to explore new possibilities with different types of entrepreneurship. Unfortunately, this isn’t the case. Top tier funds are now more exclusive than ever, since there are now other dedicated funds for diversity. The logic goes: if someone else is being diverse, then I don’t need to be. I can stay in my own enclave. It’s now someone else’s responsibility. And this echo chamber effect downstreams, where each community becomes less risk-opportunistic, less open and less willing to engage with anyone who doesn’t fit their narrow definition. The echo chamber of Silicon Valley has expanded into an echo labyrinth.I don’t know if there’s a solution to this, or if human behavior can ever be truly ‘disrupted’. All I can do is keep pushing forward, keep improving our product, keep pitching and smiling and hope that one day, we can make the future we dream of, magically, beautifully, openly, real.Co-founder CTO not compatible with previous versions

Starting a startup, or as I like to call it, “running a business”, is hard. Really fucking hard! You’ve probably heard that before. However, the idea of starting a technology company is Now that you’ve seen what it costs to run a fairly successful startup, how much does it cost to So I’m building a sexy database client. It’s an unsexy problem and could very well be a financial flop. Now that I am unemployed, I’ve been debating whether I should take a full time job, work part time, or simply stay unemployed. Each comes with their pros and cons. To provide a little background information; I’m a full-on grown up now. At the time of this article I’m 29. I have a wife, a kid, a house, a dog, and 2 cars. The only debt we have is our mortgage, and we have enough runway for 6 months of me being unemployed. My local market value as a product oriented software developer is $96,000 per year. If I were to contract or do remote work, it is about $120,000 per year.Well that is a very good question. There are 2 pretty simple reasons:So with that out there, let’s look at my options.Well, the glaring issue here is that obviously I would only have evenings and weekends to work on my new product. Between spending time with the fam jam, taking the dog for a walk, exercising, cleaning the house, etc; there isn’t much time in the day. Thus, it will take considerably longer to get the product out the door. Although I have no As you can see above, this growth looks great and I’m never in the negative! Although I am in the black as soon I release the product, we’ll see later that if I’m tolerant of some risk I can start generating more revenue sooner, which could allow me to grow the business even faster. Another thing to consider is the issue that by waiting so long to release my product I may miss my market opportunity altogether. On the positive side, from a product perspective this time constraint could force me to focus on only the work that is most important. In theory, producing a truly Obviously this would mean that I have no income. On the plus side I would have much more time to dedicate to building the product, hopefully allowing me to build a better product and ship it sooner. However, when looking at this I need to factor in the opportunity cost of me not working, As you have seen from the previous two charts, even after you launch a product it’s still going to take some time to ramp up sales. If I were to work 3 days a week, based on the same prorated $96,000/yr salary I would make $4,800 a month. Thus my opportunity cost would be $3,200/mo. I feel that, with a part time gig I would be able to get the product out in 6 months.Looking at the chart below, not only do I end up with a higher gross revenue, but I start making more money earlier compared to if I was working full time. This may allow me to further accelerate the business growth sooner. Another thing to note is that, unlike not working, if I removed opportunity cost from the equation I would also stay in the black.In reality, after the two year period, working full time yields $20,000 more net revenue than if I was working part-time, but I also need to consider my happiness. At this point I feel that I would be more fulfilled working on my own self directed project (in at least a part time capacity), and this model strikes a good balance. There is also a social benefit here. Getting out of the house and interacting with other humans can, at times, be deeply rewarding. I feel confident that having another 3 days a week (1 day left for family) plus some evenings to work will give me enough time to get the product out the door relatively quickly, while also constraining me enough to stay focused.Looking at the numbers it makes a lot of sense as to why many people flock to raising capital to start a company or simply continue to work for someone else. It’s probably very rare that you have saved enough money in order to bootstrap a company without working at the same time, and when you do factor in opportunity cost and the probability of failure, going out on your own might not be worth it.Looking at the quote above, if you are to take the plunge, I can’t help but think that it’s better to have the constraints of bootstrapping. Every startup I have been part of never seems to get as far as we expected with our initial capital.This is only a financial look at the problem. There are additional costs that I have not mentioned here. The biggest one being the fact that I will have less time to do other things besides work; exercise, spend time with family and friends, etc. There is also inevitably going to be additional stress, especially once I have bugs that need fixing and customers that need replying to. However, those are things I am aware of and willing to sacrifice for a chance to challenge myself and build a product that scratches my own itch.If you are thinking of starting a startup, look beyond the glitz and glamour.

A story of building Limitless with quick  dirty user researchAs a founder of Limitless, I was recently talking with some undergrad students about user research and how early conversations with users make a better MVP. We started Doing a job well demands singular focus. But multiple devices, each with numerous notifications, buzz, ring and vibrate to command our attention. FB status messages and cat videos distract us. With most of us spending our time on browsers, surely there must be a nice way to help us manage distractions/ track our online time. Before developing a solution, it was crucial to understand distractions, one of the main causes of low productivity . We wanted to understand the various phases we go through before entering a state of focus. The blog on For example, when we start a task, thats when we are the most prone to distractions. The mind We were in the best place to talk with our potential users - Quick discussions around the water cooler suggested that the problem of distraction was universal. It was a great opportunity to do some quick and dirty user research.We sent a quick email to the batch and asked the questions on the lines of:Everyone was superbusy but we got enough responses in person and on email to think about possible solutions.Synthesis is all about identifying patterns about the true wants/desires of the users. To synthesize the responses, we used two frameworks:For e.g, a some people talked about how they treated themselves with beer, ice cream etc after a very productive day. This recurring theme was aligned with the “Reward” stage in the Hook Model.It is very important to hear the words that people use to describe solutions. These are the attributes you need to consider before actually building stuff. Each word is represented by dots. The more times you hear the same word, the larger the dot becomes. As we can see, people really used the word “From the outset, our analysis indicated that the productivity product should be non intrusive to succeed. We studied non intrusive health trackers like the Jawbone UP and Fitbit etc. Understanding habit formation and behaviors would also add a lot of value to create a good productivity habits. We religiously studied articles and whitepapers by For us, this idea was using the New Tab of the browser. It was unexplored real estate, was extremely non intrusive and fit in the workflow of anyone who used a browser.We quickly made some mockups and got some early feedback. For the MVP, we decided to have Another thing that influenced the evolution of the mockups was Ability was out of scope for our MVP, so we focused on the right triggers and motivation. Triggers work best when the motivation is high and/ or when the ability is high.Increasing ability is very difficult and one way to counter that is to lower task difficulty. The mockups evolved as we got a deeper understanding of user motivation and behaviors. See the evolution below. Notice how we shifted the tone from “You” to “Let’s” and how the action changed to a simple link click.The final mockups of the product were at best, an hypothesis to solve the problem at hand. Testing the hypothesis and usability was important before we started full fledged development.This is where rich, interactive Keynote mockups come in.You can do quick usability testing to identify a lot of extreme use cases, gaps in design and obvious oversights. Some of the questions we asked during Usability testing.As we were thinking about a name for the product, a friend joked that what we were building was like NZT-48, the fictional nootropic drug from the movie, Limitless. The drug improved focus, helped multitask and increase general awareness.We laughed but the name stuck and Limitless was born.If you like what we built, give the app a spin Special thanks to Perpetually curious.

A few weeks ago, an intern I had worked with at a previous startup asked me for advice on how to interview successfully for UI/UX jobs. Then just yesterday, a developer friend with a young startup asked me for my advice on hiring an all-purpose, well-rounded UI/UX designer.Through these two conversations, I came up with these priorities for how I would conduct an interview. One caveat — the interview by nature, implies that it’s all about conversation. But I think the key to a ‘successful’ interview process is to make it as interactive, collaborative and productive as possible. So here are my thoughts on how I’d talk with and engage a designer applying for a job at an early-stage startup still seeking product-market fit. Part 2, the interactive part, is forthcoming. I hope it’s useful.Recovering Architect. East coast gal who wandered west. I used to design buildings, now I design experiences. Designer-founder at Design Scout.

Bill Gross is the founder of Gross has been an entrepreneur since high school, when he founded a solar energy company. In college, he patented a new loudspeaker design, and after school he started a company that was later acquired by Lotus, and then launched an educational software publishing company. Now, he serves on the boards of companies in the areas of automation, software and renewable energy.“I believe that the startup organisation is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place,” Bill Gross said, as he opened his “If you take a group of people with the right equity incentives and organise them in a startup, you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible. You get them to achieve unbelievable things,” he added.“But if the startup organisation is so great, why do so many fail?,” he asked.His presentation was focused on his findings from data gathered from hundreds of companies. He asked “what actually matters most for startup success“.He said, “I wanted to know this because I’ve been starting businesses since I was 12 years old, when I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school; to high school, when I made solar energy devices; to college, when I made loudspeakers. And when I graduated from college, I started software companies. And 20 years ago, I started Idealab. In the last 20 years, we started more than 100 companies, many successes and many big failures. We learned a lot from those failures.”Gross has looked at companies in his portfolio, combined with industry knowledge and has eventually come up with a list of five factors, which he believes, “account the most for company success and failure.”First, the idea. “I used to think that the idea was everything. I named my company Idealab for how much I worship the “aha!” moment when you first come up with the idea. But then over time, I came to think that maybe the team, the execution, adaptability mattered even more than the idea,” he said.Gross said, “I never thought I’d be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage, but he once said, “Everybody has a plan, until they get punched in the face.” And I think that’s so true about business as well. “So much about a team’s execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer.”“The customer is the true reality. And that’s why I have come to think that the team maybe was the most important thing.”“Then I started looking at the business model. Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues? That started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success,” He said.“Then I looked at the funding. Sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding. Maybe that’s the most important thing?” Gross said.He said, “And then of course, the timing. Is the idea way too early and the world’s not ready for it? Is it early, as in, you’re (in) advance and you have to educate the world? Is it just right? Or is it too late, and there’s already too many competitors?”Digging depper, Gross “looked across all 100 Idealab companies and 100 non-Idealab companies to try and come up with something scientific.”He first focused on Idealab companies; the top five companies — Citysearch, CarsDirect, GoTo, NetZero, Tickets.com — those all became billion-dollar successes. “And the five companies on the bottom — Z.com, Insider Pages, MyLife, Desktop Factory, Peoplelink — we all had high hopes for, but didn’t succeed,” he said.He continued, “I tried to rank across all of those attributes, how I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions. And then for non-Idealab companies, I looked at wild successes like Airbnb, Instagram, Uber, YouTube and LinkedIn.”Gross also considered some of the biggest failures of all time “some failures: Webvan, Kozmo, Pets.com, Flooz and Friendster. The bottom companies had intense funding; they even had business models in some cases, but they didn’t succeed. I tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most for success and failure across all of these companies, and the results really surprised me,” he said.Eventually, the intense research led Gross to believe that:“Timing accounted for 42 per cent of the difference between success and failure. Team and execution came in second, and the idea, the differentiability of the idea, the uniqueness of the idea, that actually came in third,” he said.“The last two, business model and funding, made sense to me actually. I think (a) business model makes sense to be that low, because you can start out without a business model and add one later if your customers are demanding what you’re creating. And funding, I think as well, if you’re underfunded at first but you’re gaining traction, especially in today’s age, it’s very, very easy to get intense funding,” he added.Gross went on to use Airbnb as an example. He said that at first Airbnb was “famously passed on by many smart investors because people thought, ‘No one’s going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger’. Of course, people proved that wrong. But one of the reasons it succeeded, aside from a good business model, a good idea, great execution, is the timing.”He believed that Airbnb came out right during the height of the recession during the last decade, “when people really needed extra money, and that maybe helped people overcome their objection to rent out their own home to a stranger.”“Same thing with Uber. Uber came out: incredible company, incredible business model, great execution, too. But the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system. Drivers were looking for extra money; it was very, very important,” he added.He then talked about the failures, companies that should have succeeded, but came into the market at a poor time. “We started a company called Z.com. It was an online entertainment company. We were so excited about it — we raised enough money, we had a great business model, we even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company. But broadband penetration was too low in 1999–2000. It was too hard to watch video content online; you had to put codecs in your browser and do all this stuff, and the company eventually went out of business in 2003,” he said.It was a “great idea, but unbelievable timing. In fact, YouTube didn’t even have a business model when it first started. It wasn’t even certain that it would work out. But that was beautifully, beautifully timed,” Gross explained.“So what I would say, in summary, is execution definitely matters a lot. The idea matters a lot. But timing might matter even more. And the best way to really assess timing is to really look at whether consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them. And to be really, really honest about it, not be in denial about any results that you see, because if you have something you love, you want to push it forward, but you have to be very, very honest about that factor on timing.” he said.“As I said earlier, I think startups can change the world and make the world a better place. I hope some of these insights can maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio, and thus make something great come to the world that wouldn’t have happened otherwise.” Gross concluded.Entrepreneur.

You have an idea for a startup. GREAT! Go make it! But while you’re making it, heres a few ways to get ahead in the game.As soon as you think of the idea, jump onto social media, and start an account. Even if you don’t have a product yet, start announcing to the world you exist. Start gaining likes, follows, pins, mentions, subscriptions or whatever engagement from social media platforms, you find are best in tune with your product.Start today and those early successes build upon themselves. By the time your product launches, you’ll already have an audience.How do you grow your audience? Most important thing is contributing interesting content regularly. Beyond just being interesting, you’ll need some help. Look into some of the growth hack tools below:Believe it or not, the process of creation is interesting. People will want to watch your idea come together.From Your work will be honest, will educate others by example, and all you have to do is figure what is the best way to say it. This may not be easy for you but take baby steps. Even a couple of paragraphs a week is progress.The above example is from Once a week write about your developing startup ( Not sure blogging is for you? Read some other opinions:Why get a landing page up so early? Because it’s the home to your product and idea. Even in the earliest days of conception you can have a business gaining customers or users.All a landing page needs to do is convey the problem you wish to solve, how you’re solving it, and how the user can be apart of it. Thankfully you can set that up in an hour.The best site I’ve used to launch a landing page is When you setup your page, set it for email subscriptions. Getting emails is the easiest and most straightforward way to start making some type of signup conversions.Now that you have a landing page, social media accounts that are growing, and content people want to read and share; what do you do with it all before your product is ready?Nows the time to be creative.

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) has a rich history of producing great entrepreneurs. A few weeks ago I wrote a post highlighting Entrepreneurship at UIUC is rapidly evolving and the snapshot presented here may not be a good representation of the campus in a few years. Nearly half of the programs I mention below did not exist when I started as a freshman three years ago. That said, I will periodically update this post as the ecosystem changes.At the heart of the UIUC entrepreneurship scene are the extremely talented and motivated students and the great academic programs. Many of our departments and colleges are nationally and internationally ranked, with especially strong programs in Engineering and Business.Below I’ve mapped out some of the major organizations and programs at UIUC for supporting student entrepreneurs. I have adapted a framework described in an article on Design Thinking in the June 2008 Harvard Business Review. The framework presents three categories through which all design projects must pass through: Inspiration, Ideation, and Implementation.Most of the programs at this stage help students get exposure to entrepreneurship without having to start their own company. In addition to taking courses in entrepreneurship, students can get experience by consulting startups (Most of the recently started programs at UIUC are at the ideation and implementation stages (over half were started in the last 3 years). These have helped increase the number of students working on startups and has made the ecosystem a lot more exciting.Programs at the ideation stage help students build teams (This is where the teams really become companies and get accelerated to launch their ventures.The The newest edition to the UIUC startup ecosystem, the Another resource at the implementation stage is the As these programs and the overall ecosystem at UIUC continues to improve and evolve, watch out for a larger number of quality startups coming out of central Illinois.If you’d like to learn more or have questions, The University’s official site on entrepreneurship: Senior at UIUC CS • Most recently: VC for the summer at General CatalystPosts by 

Here’s one tangible thing you can do to help: Startups are wonderful. They allow us to solve big problems, to leave things better than we found them, to be part of a motivated team, to challenge ourselves, to really use our brains, to take risks, to go for great, to learn, and to wear flip flops a lot more often.You can start a startup anywhere. But it’s easier to do it in a place where others are doing it too. Our startup community here in Philadelphia realizes this and is doing many things in an attempt to make If you have this as your goal, here’s my suggestion: put all of your might into helping a Philly-based startup be There are lots of ways you can help, including starting your own great startup or joining someone else’s. But here’s a really really easy one: start using DuckDuckGo. Make it your default search engine. Join its The great thing is, it’s on the brink of happening and a strong burst of advocacy from the Philly community might just be the thing that pushes it over the top. It’s picking up Start small — go to After you start using it and loving it, and feeling good about helping the Philly startup community with each search you make — start spreading the word.Leading the charge

04/23/2015I do a lot of coffee meetings with founders looking for marketing advice. Most of the time people have a specific marketing problem but occasionally I meet with frustrated founders complaining that everything they’re doing on the marketing and sales side just simply isn’t working.Let’s put aside the very real possibility that there is a fundamental product or product/market fit problem (a big assumption but work with me on this one) — is it possible your marketing/sales strategy is getting in the way of the success of your company? In my opinion, yes that’s very possible. Can you hack your way out of this mess? Yes, again. OK, not always, but it’s worth poking around at a few things to see if it’s fixable. If I was in charge of marketing for a company in that situation, here are a few things I would try:If you are selling to businesses there is often a separation between users, economic buyers and executives/approvers. Sometimes selling to the folks that hold the budget is the easiest way to get a deal done, but often it can be easier to either sell to the end users (who feel the pain most acutely and can champion your solution to the economic buyer), or the executive team (who might better understand the overall ROI of the solution across the organization).For example — at one company I worked at we started out Here are the things I rank when I’m looking at target buyers:The way you describe what you do will position your solution in a particular market. What market you are in, will determine what prospects see as your competition. Many startup solutions span different markets or are actually transforming an existing market into something new. You may have an opportunity to Market frame of reference is important because it signals a bunch of things to prospects including:Sometimes redefining your market space is really a matter of narrowing your focus. Most startups target too broadly and narrowing down to a sub-segment can be the key to early traction. I’ve seen startups do this by moving from being a horizontal solution to focusing on just one industry or by narrowing the focus within an industry to just one slice of it — for example, focusing on Investment banking versus Investment and Retail banking, or focusing on Residential Real Estate versus focusing on both Residential and Commercial.Startups tend to fall in love with their own offerings and spend too much time talking about features that were technically difficult to build but aren’t critical to prospects. Prospects on the other hand usually don’t buy solutions because of 5 so-so benefits — they buy because there is one key thing that your solution has that they can’t get anywhere else. Sure there are other things your product probably needs to do in order to ultimately win the business, but marketing’s first job is to get a lead hooked. Are you leading with what your prospects think is your biggest strength?At one startup I worked with we went from our site highlighting 5 key features to simply talking about one big benefit to prospects, resulting in more leads and higher close rates. At another we re-trained the sales force to lead every prospect conversation and demo with our key differentiating feature and to only move on to other aspects of the solution after that was well understood. Again, conversion and close rates improved dramatically.Sometimes the problem isn’t the front of the funnel, it’s getting the leads you attract to convert to paying customers. Understanding the For example, I worked at a company that sold large enterprise systems to technical buyers and we often got stuck doing proof of concept tests that never progressed into deals. We started to offer an alternative off-site real data test (we took a sample of their data and ran a test in our own lab) that was faster and more controlled than an on-site POC and led to more sales that closed quicker.At another company we found that we couldn’t close a deal without giving buyers a way to test the system live ahead of time. Even though prospects didn’t ask for a POC we offered it, managed it in a very controlled manner, and closed deals faster. I’ve seen companies do interesting things with free trials and up-selling and cross-selling offers that accomplish the same goal of getting prospects in the funnel unstuck. Looking at not only where deals are dropping out of the funnel but really understanding why can lead you to creative changes in your sales process that move prospects along.Do you like this?

Sooooo, it’s been a while since I wrote on here and I wanted to do a quick little something. After numerous years around the startup world, first as a founder and more recently advising/supporting startups at early to mid stage you get to see a lot. One thing always comes through for me: solving problems can be fun, just as long as you know the risks involved.There is no doubt in my mind that cross-skilled, Lean teams can create great startups and grow them to be great businesses. It’s also never been cheaper to do. All ideas have a chance at some point, at least for a period of time. It’s simply a matter of excellent execution and the alignment of the planets of the ecosystem and market (ahem! Sounds easy, right?).With this context in mind, I was thinking about all the terminology and buzzwords that float about and wanted to take a tongue-in-cheek look at what they might mean. Here’s my intentionally obtuse guide to startup terminology (please feel free to add your own alternatives too):(Insert industry prefix)tech — vaguely tech related, in some way, maybeFriction — it’s like they’ve seen a ghost, they just stop dead right there…and there…and there.

According to my mentor What you choose to build speaks for itself, more than anything you claim. It shows that you are so engaged in a problem that you would spend free time to solve that problem.Then write about the stuff you build, the challenges you face, what you learn, and how this project is relevant to addressing the problem you want to solve. Writing about what I recently built helps me organize my thoughts and makes me reflect on what I’ve learned from the development process.Writing for a target audience is also very important. In my last Not just recruiters or employers. Figure out your own direction and what you want in your next role. Be honest when approaching people. Whether it’s to maximize your learning, or to build your company’s suggestion engine, all of it starts with an honest conversation with someone. I never initiate conversation with the intention of getting a job, but more so to understand what they’re about, whether they are someone I want to work with, or if I can contribute to their project.In my recent meetings, I had to turn down contract jobs because many other things were going on, but I did not walk away empty handed. I still communicate with those people as colleagues and friends.These moments of serendipity make the job search tolerable and almost fun. If all my meetings turned out like it did with my last offers, I would be very happy job hunting.Meetings also don’t only occur in interviews, but also at meetups and conferences. Attending a meetup for something you’re really interested is a great way to not only learn and network, but also meet other people that share the same interests.Whiteboarding practice is necessary. It’s a skill tangential to programming, and it takes practice to write code outside of an IDE and without documentation. In my experience, coming up with algorithms on the spot is not the hard part, but more so the expression of your thoughts to someone in a clear and coherent manner; pair programming is an excellent way to practice this. I have to thank In the past, I thought that my technical ability was not up to snuff. During pair programming, I realized I learned to handle almost any problem on the spot with the help of google and stack overflow. The insight my partner offered on how she approached a problem was also very important to how I learned as well. I can use and incorporate the thought process into my own way of thinking.Building and writing are the easy parts. The true challenge is meeting people and interacting. Don’t get discouraged if your first interaction with someone doesn’t work out. Reflect and adjust your behavior or criteria for the people you want to meet and eventually you will find someone that will not only listen to you, but also openly share their projects and dreams.I hope this helps people who read this get their dream jobs in tech.

Do you want to invest in startups? Chances are you can’t, even if you wanted to.Laws created eight decades ago prohibit most Americans (nearly 97% of households) from investing in private companies because they aren’t “accredited.” The laws have had a The JOBS Act introduced a Late last year, the SEC indicated it will finalize Title III this October. The SEC has set such goals for itself in the past, yet has consistently failed to meet them. We’re hoping the SEC sticks by its October deadline, and finally implements Title III.In all of this hurrah, however, do the masses really want to invest in startups? After countless conversations with people that can’t accredit, we have an inkling they do. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, there hasn’t been a large-scale survey measuring this appetite.So we are excited to announce that we partnered with Mattermark, the leading company intelligence platform, to conduct the We hope the Survey helps demonstrate that people want to invest in startups, and we’ll also gather information on such things as:We’ll use the data to urge the SEC to finalize Title III, and to inform our policy recommendations in case the SEC punts its obligation once again.Head on over to Quire to where communities become ownersAn exploration of community, crowdfunding and culture.

I’m not sure about you, but I’ve got about 50+ domains for “projects” that have never gone anywhere.What most people don’t know is when I started working on Even though both were great ideas and solutions I used… they weren’t the right project to grow into a business (for me).The tough part is always picking the right idea, project or business in life.At a high level, it comes down to these 3 things… but not for the reasons you think.You’ll really need to watch the video to get the gist.But here they are:1) TrendsI’ve started 5 companies Now, a favour…What I’d love to hear from you is how many projects you’ve started? How many went nowheres? I’d LOVE to hear from you so I know I’m not the only one :)… leave a comment with your answer below.Have an amazing day!-DanFamily first! CEO / Founder of Clarity 

In late 2013, I started a SaaS company with two other cofounders focused on selling desktop and mobile software to general contractors and remodelers.The three of us had worked together before and were all hungry to start something on our own. So we began looking for problems to solve and settled on the home remodeling industry.As it turns out, most contractors’ problems are related to scheduling. Delays eat into their profits. And any work that has to be re-done usually comes out of their own pocket. So we figured contractors would be eager to try anything that would increase efficiency.Home remodeling is a fast-paced business built around people — not technology. We believed that it was a perfect opportunity for disruption.So with six months’ of funding, we set out on a mission to make life easier for general contractors.And six month later, we had built But we shut it down.We learned a lot in those six months.It’s so easy to find prospective customers, show them your prototype, and get a false positive. We spent a lot of time building relationships with contractors and almost every single one we interviewed loved our ideas and prototypes. We grew a solid pipeline of qualified leads. But when we made the software available for beta, not a single contractor used it on a job.When we’d interview contractors about why they weren’t using the software, we began to realize that what the contractors really needed was to be on six job sites at once. Their primary problem was that there was only one of them.Listening to users is the best way to identify a problem worth solving. But we shouldn’t assume that positive user feedback around ideas and prototypes will predict purchasing behavior.So sell it before it’s built.As a founder, your job is to sell. And to sell early.At a minimum, your pitch should always include how much your customers love your product and Just as we were iterating around our product, we had to find the ways to connect with contractors and fine tune our sales model. But first, we had to find our potential customers to begin with.The first bit is easy: Try Google. A phone book. Buy a list. Look up organizations that your customers belong to. Or find out where your customers are physically. Just get some names and numbers.We learned pretty quickly that contractors are busy. They’re always on the phone. Always on the job site. And they’re never sitting patiently in their office waiting for a software demo. Crazy, right?However, after a lot of experimentation, we discovered that cold calling worked. Good old fashioned cold calling. (Not the most glamorous thing in the world to three guys who had spent their careers in technology.)Contractors apparently get a lot of cold calls — but they’re usually pitched building materials, not software. We expected hang ups. But with almost startling repeatability, we found that contractors were happy to let us pitch and most were quite excited about the product. In many cases when we left voicemails, they’d even call us back!Cold calling isn’t glamorous, We thought six months would give us more than enough time to prove a need, build some software, and have enough sales to get angel investors lining up to fund our next 12–18 months.What we learned: Six months isn’t a lot of time, and for us, didn’t allow us to fail in time to pursue another strategy. We only had enough time for one shot.What would we have done differently? See #1 above. And possibly scrapped together more money.We also applied to a startup incubator here in Austin, TX (and were accepted), in month five — probably five months too late. The limited time we spent with them was extremely valuable. Just too late.The three of us had worked together for years before starting Contractor View. We had grown a business line and gone through an IPO together. Knew each other’s kids. And we worked together extremely well: Jason was technology, Keith handled operations/sales/marketing, and I was responsible for creative and product.Knowing what we went through, I can’t imagine doing it with anyone else.You make a billion decisions as a startup. Decisions around fundraising. Hiring. Office location. And on and on.Call us naive, but our goal was to build a fiscally sound company. We weren’t kids creating the next app — we were relatively seasoned guys selling software to contractors.Over those few months, we had the pleasure of meeting with some brilliant investors. But in the end, they all had the same response:Interpretation: And on some level, they were right about the opportunity — and it didn’t make sense for their business.And that’s because angel investing is risky. Most startups fail. So you have to invest in X companies a year and hope that Y of them will have a huge return in the next few years. Do we regret trying? No way. I’d do it again. In fact, can’t wait to do it again.Personally, my only regret is that I bit too early on our positive user feedback. That is one of the larger mistakes I’ve made as a product manager.If you’re thinking about starting something, pick the right cofounders, start selling, fail fast.

Entrepreneurs like Globally, there has been this mega trend to glamourise startups.Truth is, most reporting on startups suffers from success bias. Nobody wants to report on a dying startup unless the founder went on to create another successful startup (check the story of Meerkat’s founders).Over the last decade, the number of Malaysians working on their own startup has probably increased by at least a Movies such as The Social Network have popularised the idea of building your own startup, just like The X Factor and American Idol have popularised the idea of being a singer.Now, everyone wants to build their own startup, buy their respective roof top office in the big city and turn it into their own Google Plex.The only problem is that the motivation should be toward solving a problem, not The reality is nothing like what is portrayed in movies and on the internet. Every single startup is an enormous risk, a huge effort, and a tremendous continuous fight. It requires constant investments of time, energy and commitment. It consumes all of your emotional energy, and all of your attention.Having been a ‘start up guy’ for the last two years, I’ve learned that starting a company is the most fun I have ever had. Unfortunately, it’s one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do.I’m no longer afraid to admit this. I am not afraid to talk openly about it with my friends and colleagues. Until you succeed as a startup founder, you’ll live with the constant Many startups run on fear (especially in the early days), such asThe saddest words that I have heard from a founder was from a friend who have given up on her startup, she said:Fear is not a bad thing. Fear is a huge motivator, perhaps even better than Kanye West’s Ego.It’s what keeps you focused in a startup. Personally, I’ve always thrived on fear, because it can bring out the best in me. I believe that the moment you get too comfortable, you’ll lose your competitive edge.Building a startup means hardly having time for family, no time for a Now, it’s cheaper to create a startup than a decade ago. But, many interconnected technologies, people and details must come together to get even the simplest startup off the ground.Startups are the place where dreams turn to ash. The default mode for a startup is survival, because most founders lack experience. Hence, they usually go from one idiotic mistake to another. These mistakes are usually responsible for turning dreams to ashes.Trying to launch a product as a Nobody is hard. Trying to get clients as a nobody is hard.

Blogging over the past six months has made me sad.And that’s a bit of an odd revelation considering 1. I work in marketing 2. I go on about the power of bloggers over traditional press to the brands I work with on a daily basis and 3. Up until about 6 months ago my blog — I started it in a time when I was a bit unsure about my next career move, and wanted a creative outlet outside of work, where I could write what I liked and call it my own. It worked.For 6 months I grew crazy with the blogging fever — I wrote and published at least four posts a week, setup and managed social accounts and even began building a team of great writers who contributed to the site. I even felt that heady, nothing-quite-like-it feeling of ‘viral’ after And then I fell out of love.I started a new job (which coincidentally, I only got an interview for because of the so called blog), had less time and started to realise Fast forward six months and I’ve approached a crossroads. I feel midly embarassed to have a blog in my After a lot of thought, here’s what I’ve come up with.I work in marketing and one of the things I specialise in, is marketing for startups. In this field, you have to be more creative, more organic and a little ‘outside the box’ in the methods you use, to get a relatively unknown, probably poor, possibly revolutionary idea that even its own industry isn’t ready for yet, product or business the traction it needs to grow. It’s why I love it so much.The methods I use — social media, display advertising, PPC, SEO, content marketing, traditional PR, stunt PR, email — they can all be done on a budget and if you find the right one, can gain you incredible growth at sustainable cost.So I had a thought. Why not apply the same methods and services I use to my blog? Why not see if, in a 6–9 month period, I can treat my blog as a startup, put some budget into ads, test some methods of traction and see what it can become. In essence, why don’t I try marketing my blog like a startup.So that’s what I’ve decided.

Sometimes we can get a little wrapped up in… ourselves.I’ve done it, you’ve done it — when you turn on ESPN and wonder why The Bears have a Minimal Viable Product, when your mom calls the day of a holiday you’re supposed to be celebrating and you don’t know why she’s surprised you’re working, or when you mistake a band shirt for a new startup, — you’re being a Startup-Bubble-Head.Let’s all take a deep breath.| Cofounder of Fittr.

In early 2014, I founded a mobile advertising agency that specializes in driving sustainable revenue growth for non-gaming apps on Android/iOS.Since then, our team has been fortunate to help more than 20 amazing companies (all at various stages of staffing, funding, etc…) grow the right way. On top of our clients, I have had countless other conversations with companies who are seeking help to do the same.With that level of exposure over time, I’m starting to be see patterns in startups who end up successful and those who eventually fall short. One of the major indicators is their perception of self as an organization.In 2015, it’s en vogue to found, work at, or invest in a startup. As a result, there is a culture around this coolness. That culture is totally disjointed from the actions that make startups turn into successful companies.Companies that have a culture that is connected with the “forever a startup” mentality tend to have less success. Those who operate with a healthy dose of fear that they won’t be able to shift from startup to sustainable company fast enough tend to have better outcomes (exits, sharper operations, and better products and services).In a time when startups are trendy, remember that Steve Jobs, Larry Page, and Mark Zuckerberg aren’t famous for their startups — they are famous for the generational companies that were born from within them.Helping grow mobile companies

Before I lay out the seven building blocks that we need to foster the Indonesia startup ecosystem, let me explain where Indonesia’s tech industry stands at the moment relative to its neighbors.Late last year, I was invited to Korea as part of I believe that Indonesia is the next Startup Nation if we are able to weave all the building block in the industry. Let’s take a closer look at Indonesia current state and how we can contribute making it happen.The first generation of Internet entrepreneurs in Indonesia is mostly successful because of their skills and persistence. The second generation of Internet entrepreneurs is mostly coming back from studying and work in high tech companies abroad. The third category comes from previous executives working in the global/multinational Internet companies in the region or Indonesia. They have multi-ethnic background and many of them have an investment banking/management consulting experience.Proliferation of ideas and knowledge comes from the With the Indonesian digital industry growth, there is a big need to capture the best talent not only from Indonesia, but from other countries as well. By attracting exceptionally skilled immigrants, they can bring new knowledge and create jobs within the local economy. It’s new businesses that are going to In order to maintain Indonesia to become innovative and entrepreneurial nation, policymakers need to take steps to attract more highly-skilled entrepreneurial foreigners and global talents to Indonesia.Bali is a new fast growing startup scene that people are surprised by. By embracing the international talent like what have been done in Bali, we might be able to repeat the story of It is estimated that On the other hand, the total number of international students studying in Indonesia is only about 3,000 students. Indonesian labour market is characterised by a high level of youth unemployment since the vocational education and training currently doesn’t match the requirements of the industry. An interesting idea mentioned by To help achieve this, the government should commit on skilled and vocational education. Credits from community colleges should be transferable to a university, thus offering graduates opportunities to further their vocational training at a higher level.A startup by nature have a very high mortality rate considering that they are still exploring their offering and business model. Most startups fail. That’s why grants and CSR money is the best models in an incubation stage. The cost of delivering the investment, incubate the company and exploring to get an initial traction is higher than the potential return on investment. Incubation program is risky and mostly won’t provide a good ROI from the program, so CSR fund from various state-owned or public companies is the best to be used as an incubation program.Venture capital investing by nature is also a risky investment, the higher the risk, the better the return. Some of the risks include a high failure rate because of entrepreneur’s lack of experience, getting into a market that is too early, creating an offering that doesn’t scale and a very limited exit for the investment. We have seen this in the early The partnership between the government and private venture capitals has been implemented by various countries such as “Who will be responsible if the investment goes wrong? Will the appointed VC be blamed if they lose the investment? Will this be a subject to The Indonesia’s conglomerate group has been investing in the digital space like Djarum through With the support from local investors, Indonesia is infamous for its unfriendly bureaucracy for processing a business permit and unwelcoming regulations for foreign direct investment. The President promised that this will become a thing in the past and have launched a As a popular figure, the President and member of its executive team, seemed too easy announcing controversial issues. As quoted in the media, they mentioned that the government would protect local online businesses from When it comes to startup, we need a change on the And there are some controversies towards a regulation in the e-commerce space as the government announcing Indonesia’s market value of the broadband business is growing more than double due to a high Internet adoption. However, The President pitched to the global leader at Indonesia has a low level of digital money infrastructure and adoption. The The thriving mobile sector of Indonesia opens up a door for mobile as an alternative-banking infrastructure able to offer accessible, simple and affordable financial services even in remote areas. But mobile telco is not proven to provide financial services, as they have a historical precedent on abusing the mobile content charging. And since they don’t have ATM, the e-wallet solution offered by the telco is not easy to be cashed-in.Out of Large scale adoption is still the biggest challenge for the e-money. The key driver for the e-money adoption comes from unexpected source, the Indonesian government. After stopping the soaring burden for fuel subsidy, the government is giving a direct cash subsidy to the underprivileged people called BLNT (direct non cash subsidy).

If you are founding a company and want to hire the right people, look no further than your favorite NFL team for evidence of how (or how NOT) to build your winning squad. For me, only one in 32 teams will build the best roster, and achieve the exit they want: a Super Bowl victory.For you, the odds of attaining your goals are likely much, much worse. That said, startups do have a variety of paths to “success,” from an IPO to acquisition by some Silicon Valley powerhouse to building a sustainable privately held company (despite what your VC’s tell you, those actually do exist).When starting a company, you need to think like an NFL team, which starts a new business in the same field year after year. Think of it this way: you hit free agency, so to speak; your non-compete has run out, and you are ready to forge a new startup. You will, of course, try to bring the best and brightest with you from your previous team, but other agendas are always at play. Other companies/teams will offer your targets better pay. Some will offer them more responsibility/playing time, flexibility, and autonomy, etc.Before you can even think about building out a successful team, though, you are going to need a foundation for growth; you want to make sure you build your house on rock, not sand. So who/what do you grow your team/company around?So where do you start? What’s the most important position in your company? If you answered “Tight End”, you’re funny and awesome, but I’m going to guess your levity isn’t having the impact on your balance sheet that you had hoped for.The Quarterback/Founder is the most important player on a team’s offense. Why? It’s not because he gets all the endorsements and fancy commercials, or because he gets to call the plays. It’s because he handles the ball on EVERY. SINGLE. PLAY. Like most startup founders trying to navigate their way through the twists and turns of building something, quarterbacks, too, must become adept at making quick, competent decisions, and moving on to the next play — regardless of the outcome.Founders, you are expected to be the leader. You must force yourself to lead, even if you aren’t comfortable with it yet. Andrew Luck’s freshman year, he had to control a huddle filled with guys older and more experienced than he was, but he knew that getting comfortable leading that group was the only path to success for him. And so it shall be for you. It comes with the job; you The reality is that teams without a good quarterback struggle.Even the [insert adjective here] people in the media know that. (I wouldn’t put too much stock into anything else they say.) As a company grows, the founder usually grows into the role of head coach, simply because he or she can’t make Bringing in the right people is probably the most difficult task faced by both NFL teams and growing companies. Using these basic concepts, though, you can help propel your team in the right direction.Instagram: A Sports Illustrated® publication. (By way of Medium.)

My interviewer didn’t have any shoes or socks on.I learned quickly that this wasn’t a pretentious affectation, but rather a fact: Nick genuinely doesn’t like wearing shoes. Or socks.It was just one of a thousand things which took a little getting used to when I moved from a traditional marketing role into a SaaS startup trying its damnedest to compete.I’m not talking about those companies still claiming startup-hood in order to appeal to stockholders or inspire ‘innovation’ within their 3500 employees in London, Madrid, New York and San Francisco.I’m talking about a proper startup. A startup where you come into work at 9:03 am and Shoeless Nick is still under his desk, eyes closed on one of the single mattresses which get pushed against a wall during the day. A startup where, if our mothers knew how many Red Bulls we went through, we’d be pulled home by our earlobes.Startups are a force of nature. They’re where Jobs screamed at a staff working 70-hour weeks until the Macintosh appeared; where Musk showered at the YMCA and At least In fact, But life is a gamble, and nothing big ever gets done without a little risk.I’d been in the city for a couple months, and the week before had been fired from a place-holder job at a bike repair shop after my boss had (at last) noticed that I knew absolutely nothing about how to repair bikes.The shoeless interviewer at Wishpond sold me on professional and personal development as well as the desire to “be in at the beginning.”He sold me, as well, on his own story — that of an aimless young graduate who had found something to believe in and work his ass off to realize. I imagine I sold him on the same thing.But I won’t, because (though fascinating) my story is not the reason I’m writing.For those of you itching to shake your head at me and say “James, what the hell can you possibly know about making a startup succeed? You just told us you were a failed bike repairman who joined a startup 18 months ago.”This next section is information I’ve gleaned from conversations with our founder, our investors, my colleagues and my days (and nights) working at Wishpond.These are the things that are working for us:Yet we were also comfortable with spending when it was needed (for instance, on good people), while remaining constantly aware of reducing burn.Ol’ tattoo face makes a good point. And this is another thing that successful startups have over unsuccessful ones:When you first release a new product things will happen that you didn’t expect. There is no doubt of this. Something’s going to come along and punch you in the face.But, so long as you have a system in place that catches mistakes, good people around you, and are open to change (and late nights), you can weather it.When our CEO, Ali, is in his office till 11pm the rest of us bear witness, and know he’s working his ass off to grow this thing.If you show you care every moment of every day, your employees see it, and care as well.If you expect much from yourself, (and so long as they respect you) the right kind of people will match you, pound for pound.Startups are different not just in what we do and how we do it, but in what we expect of the people around us.Yet (and I want to emphasize the hell out of this point) And you don’t do this by creating a work environment of extracurricular laser tag, ping pong and catered lunches — My CEO could tell you to the cent how much Domino’s delivery costs for 8 pizzas (with tip). He could tell you what a weekly Costco shop runs us when you’re feeding 40 people breakfast, lunch, dinner and Red Bull every day.He knows, as well, that it’s worth it. He knows that a well-fed group of people pushed towards a common goal is, usually, what ends up changing the worldThis article was a look back at the past year and a half of my life. It conjured up memories of foosball tournaments with other startups around Vancouver, drinking from a red cup out of a beaten-up keg. It evoked memories of impossible deadlines we somehow met, work-filled evenings with hair askew, and the bitter taste of too many energy drinks on the tongue.If you have ever been lucky enough to be part of a successful startup, you’ll know what I’m talking about, and you’ll smile. Because it’s worth smiling about.Will I guarantee that Yes. Absolutely.I’m going to make damn sure of it.Content strategist and professional blogger 

June 9, 2012 was a day that will live in infamy. Nike released the I spent a year searching for a pair, but ultimately didn’t trust anybody online because I couldn’t confirm authenticity. The idea of kickpush was born the following summer after I saw someone wearing the very shoes I couldn’t get my hands on.For many, sneakers are more than something you put on your feet; they’re an obsession. There is a cottage industry of independent sneaker resellers who figured out how to make money, but how do you know if you’re buying authentic pairs? Why does this problem even exist?kickpush was designed to put consumers at ease by uniting resellers and buyers into one platform that uses people and technology to authenticate sneakers.I decided our minimum viable product would be a clickable prototype, lifestyle video, and a landing page. Our main goal was to show users how easy the app was to use.Money was something we didn’t have a lot of, so we decided not to spend any on development without interest from users. We took an iterative approach to the prototype and incorporated real-time feedback from sneaker enthusiasts on reddit, forums, and friends.The people were interested and we had an 85% response rate for interviews, surveys, and product demos. I was lucky enough to review the prototype with Sports Industry Analyst  Sneaker Economist, After our initial round of research, we had over 100 features and knew we needed to streamline them for prototype. We wanted to include all of them, but it didn’t make sense to design a ton of features without knowing users would use the product.After narrowing down our backlog of features, I taught myself how to use I needed a way to make the design come to life and discovered After many investor meetings, I got an offer I couldn’t refuse: a complete buyout. I didn’t want to build something from the ground up and decided to sell. My decision wasn’t easy and I had to reflect on my exit strategy: own a real pair of Nike Air Yeezy II’s.I bought them last week.Yeezy taught me well.Interactive Producer | Solid dude with too many sneakers.

Kicking off a series of stories from inspiring entrepreneurs and creatives in our community and beyond, we caught up with Ricardo, CEO of It all started when Ricardo quit his corporate job in 2014 to start freelancing and allowing more room for travel. Together with a few friends in similar situations, their first destination was set: South America. While working and travelling together, they started The One or two people are usually responsible for arranging the logistics to ensure business operations run smoothly.For the startup team to travel and work together harmoniously, a few rules are required! Not staying in the same hotel, or even the same neighbourhood, is the first. ‘We’re all friends, but it’s also important to have the option of private time.’ says Ricardo.With the team being very close, Mobipium has created a unique company culture but, sure, there are also conflicts. Like in any other company, those issues arise every now and then. Unlike many other companies, however, Ricardo pays very close attention to resolving them immediately.By being flexible and reflective about their actions, the team is learning how to make this lifestyle work as they go.How long Mobipium will continue to travel is unclear. ‘We’ll travel together as long as it is manageable for us’, says Ricardo. ‘We’re now tackling Southeast Asia, then we’ll see where the journey will take us.’What fascinated us about the Mobipium team is their passion to travel and discover the world, while maintaining a strong focus on pushing their business forward. Their story and experience demonstrate how, with determination and creativity, it is possible to combine the dream of working and travelling, even as a team of eight.To the Mobipium team we wish all the best, and are very much looking forward to seeing how their story continues.An easy way for startups and freelancers to find the right workspace.

Most founders I know spend too much time and money coming up with a name for their startup.On day 1 all you have is an idea. That idea is without value until you’ve executed on a product and have some sort of validation that there’s a market for what you’re building.Your time, energy and money are so valuable and scarce, you can’t spend them on naming your startup (idea)! Your initial idea WILL change and evolve (or fail) and the name you decided on may no longer fit the new focus or become completely irrelevant altogether.Personally, the worst I’ve seen was a good friend spending $35,000 on a .com, when all he had was a concept. No wireframes and zero customer development!Please don’t do this — it is a serious waste of money!Now, there is an argument for spending big money on a .com once you’ve found initial product/market fit… but until then all you need is On day one we actually named our concept CodeCop.After 2 days of customer development meetings we knew we needed to change the name. Everyone hated it!We planned to meet the morning of customer development day 3 to figure out a name change, but by time I grabbed my morning coffee, Ian wanted a .com and something resembling ‘happy founders.’ He spent ~5 minutes mashing words together via Honestly, I didn’t really like the choice, but I also didn’t want to waste time coming up with something else, which could potentially receive the same feedback CodeCop had. I saw it as an improvement and that was good enough by me.From there it was easier to brand and talk about what we were doing by dropping the ‘Founder’ and just going with, ‘Having operated under ‘Bliss’ for roughly 4 months now and, for the most part, having received positive feedback, the name has grown on me.There are still people who are adamantly against the name Bliss — telling us it sounds like a spa or nail salon. Others just simply feel it’s a bad name for a startup tech company. We’re working on this segment…“Name-haters” have been receiving a surprise package with Bliss mugs as a friendly reminder of our perceived bad name:Long term, it’s still to be determined if we continue with the name Bliss. For now, however, we’re happy with it and most of the feedback remains positive. Just like that first day when Ian purchased founderbliss.com, we don’t want to waste any time or energy brainstorming or researching something “better.”Our priority is getting to initial product/market fit (which we haven’t yet), not if we have the best name possible. Yours should be too.CEO of 

In 2015, everyone should code. That’s a little ambitious. OK. In 2025, I hope that the majority of the world has the chance to program computers. Code is the foundation for startups, tech companies, and the tools that everyone uses on a daily basis. It’s important we all know how it works. Although we are years away from a world in which the majority of the population programs, I think everyone at your startup needs to know about code today.You’ve been hired by super-cool-stealthy-funded startup Your first task is to change all of the copy on the website. You rewrote everything. It’s totally witty and brilliant and now it’s ready to ship. Next step: coordinate your request with the engineer’s schedule.Wat. Wait, no. Come on, now.You go into the code and make the changes yourself! Your startup doesn’t have time to wait for the engineers. And, your engineers have to focus on significant architectural challenges to prepare for millions of people using your app. You identify where the previous copy was in the repository and swap it with your new poetic lines.Your startup only lives once and your coding skills mean that you get to actively contribute to its success.You realize that 90% of the people who land on your registration page leave without having registered. There is a huge opportunity to change the website’s experience so more visitors convert into users.You ask the engineers if there is something wrong with the registration page. You wait for their response.Wat. Oh jeez. No, please, no.With your programming knowledge, you suspect that there might be a bug that is preventing users from successfully registering for the app. You investigate your application performance monitor and realize that your thoughts were correct. There are errors everywhere. You fire up your browser and try to replicate the problem based on a hypothesis that there might be a client-side issue. Sure enough, your ability to think through the problem allows you to identify the issue.Instead of asking the engineers why the conversion rate is so low, you tell them that your troubleshooting skills allowed you to identify a problem. Your understanding of how code works on the web allowed you to replicate an issue and to communicate it effectively to the engineers.You want to work in startups because everyone wants to work in startups!

You wonder how the project is coming along and so you ask the engineer every couple hours about the status.Wat. Oh not this again….You’re not scared of code and you know how to read a README file. You follow the instructions and quickly spin up the repository on your local machine. You switch to the branch your colleague is working on and observe the latest status.

So, you think I am crazy, eh? That I would leave a stable career behind to venture out into untested waters? Good. Yes — I’ve heard the statistics about startup “failure” and that there is a good set of odds against the industry. However, there are two types of people in this world:Starting a company was never meant to be easy because if it were, more people would be doing it. My family, but also most of our society, does not understand unconventional pursuits and well, nonconformists. I am constantly antagonised about the authenticity of my career and that I should get a “real job”. I have worked for many people in the past, in menial jobs, but also in highly technical positions at companies around North America. I have always found myself aspiring to lead, not be led. I love working in small high-intensity teams, working to find innovative solutions to complex problems and implementing them. Here are my three reasons why I believe startups are better work atmospheres than corporate endeavours:All-in-all, I prefer to work for and with startups because I prefer the vibe and attitude of sharing responsibilities in a way that allows small intensity-driven teams with excessive productivity to thrive. Maybe you should consider leaving your comfortable cubicle for a career that entails greater risks for greater rewards. You don’t have to start something to help finish it.For now, this is all. ✌I am a developer and designer (and sometimes writer).Sometimes I post here.

So you decided to move forward with doing a startup? (Now, I don’t want to be a Debby Downer or rain on your parade, so please don’t take it as such. But I would like to be candid with you, because I truly do want you to be successful So here’s my advice, straight up. Before you quit your 9–5 and dive head first into developing your startup, take a few weeks (or a few months if you need to) to do these six things. These six things extend beyond the “A personal mission statement is a philosophy or creed. It focuses on what you want to be (character) and to do (contributions and achievements) and on the values or principles upon which being and doing are based.”- Stephen R. Covey, author of There are many ways to draft a personal mission statement, but here are a few questions to get you thinking about what you may include:Getting clear on who you are, who you want to be, and what you want to give and get out of life, creates a roadmap of sorts that tells you which paths to take and which to avoid. Knowing yourself well means knowing how to make choices in your everyday life that align to your most authentic self and bring about the most happiness and fulfillment possible.The greater the alignment between your Personal Mission Statement and your startup, the greater commitment you may have to seeing your startup through to the very end (however you define “the end”). When grounded in a deeper sense of purpose, your startup is no longer just something you’re doing because you can, because other people said it’s an opportunity worth pursuing, because you’ll be rich and famous, etc. Your startup now becomes something that truly reflects your core beliefs, values, and/or passions. It’s something much deeper, and thus, much more fulfilling. Your startup is something you’re willing to But before I move on, let me point out something important, that may not be so obvious. Your startup does not have to be the perfect representation of Again, the purpose of Steps 1 and 2 is to force you to have a real dialogue with yourself about the parallels that do (or do not) exist between who you are and what your startup is. Any parallels you’re able to identify are important. They’re important because you can refer to them when the going gets tough, when you’re in need of some motivation, and your frustration screams out, There are many reasons startups fail, but here are three of the biggest:1) Co-founder issues2) Loss of interest and/or will to keep going3) Run out of moneyStarting a company does require a It’s totally normal for startup founders to keep their full-time job, or move to a part-time gig, in order to make an income, as they develop their startup in their free time. For many entrepreneurs, it isn’t until they’ve saved enough money, taken out a loan, or secured some early stage investment funds that they make the jump to full-time startup founder.Your partner, family, and friends are key people in your life, and you’re going to want them around to support you as you embark on this new adventure. The best thing you can do to ensure they’ll want to stand by you and cheer you on as you puruse your dream, is for you to be upfront and honest with them about what your plans are and what changes they can expect.Being proactive with your loved ones about the changes resulting from your startup does two really important things for the relationship:But the fact remains: no matter how well you communicate what you’re about to do, some people in your life may not like it. Some people may want to stick around and support you, but others may not. That is the risk you are taking by doing a startup and making the choice to significantly alter certain aspects of your life. Either way, it’s best to have this conversation as early as possible, so you can figure out who in your life is willing to take this ride with you, and who in your life needs you to make some changes to your plan, in order for them to be happy too.All in all, your loved ones will be a huge part of your happiness, sanity, and success as you build your startup. You will want those Co-founder issues are one of the main reasons startups fail. For all the same reasons I listed in Steps 1 and 2, it’s incredibly important that anyone you’re considering working with write a mission statement too. The more clear they are about As the founder of the company, you want people on your team who are fully committed. It is going to require a tremendously in sync and collaborative team to create a great startup. The Personal Mission Statements are tools you can use as a type of screen to confirm alignment up front, avoiding a lot of the problems many startups experience down the line.Personal development is the act of engaging in activities that contribute to the flourishment of you as a person. These activities could include reading books, watching videos, attending seminars, etc. The key to personal development is that you are intentionally carving out time every day or week to work on yourself, developing the skills of self-management, confidence, belief, motivation, leadership, communication, discipline, gratitude, creativity, etc.The fact is, you are the most important project you can ever work on, and as you improve your personal capabilities, you will see it manifest in other areas of your life, notably your startup. So fall in love with the process of becoming; becoming your very best self. It will pay off in ways you can’t imagine.So there you have it: some of my biggest pieces of advice to those getting ready to gear up and enter the lion’s den. I hope you feel a bit more equipped to handle what’s in store for you, but let’s be honest, even all those things aren’t going to be able to keep you completely out of harm’s way.Startups by nature are tumultuous, and you are certain to get hit, lose your breath, and fall down a few times. No amount of preparation or tips can save you from that fate. But, if you do buckle down and invest time in the six areas I mentioned, Checkout my new site, Portfolio Services Director at Kapor Capital | Founder of The Startup Couch | Forbes 30 Under 30 | TEDx Presenter | 

When I join an early-stage company as acting CMO, one of the first questions I ask is, “Who’s our Darth Vader?” Strange as this may sound, a clear, compelling answer to that question — shared across the entire team — is crucial for scaling revenue, recruiting great team members, and attracting quality later-stage investors.In any compelling story, whether a startup’s or a screenwriter’s, a hero with whom we empathize must do battle with some powerful force to reach a better place. In To craft a compelling startup drama, cast your customer in the role of hero. Just like Frodo, Cady, and other protagonists, yours wants a better future, but must confront forces that stand in the way (which, of course, your company will help him/her overcome). In fact, take a close look at the messaging of successful Silicon Valley companies, and you’ll almost always find an implied Darth Vader:The most effective Vaders implicitly answer the question, “Why now?” Uber, for example, is basically saying that the world has changed, and now nearly everything can be as simple as tapping a button. Why not rides?To define the Darth Vader in your company story, consider the following two questions:Sometimes the answers are obvious, but sometimes they’re more subtle. The best approach is to pose the questions to customers and/or prospects and listen carefully to what they say.For example, I recently worked with a startup that improves hardware performance. The executive team initially described the Darth Vader in its customers’ way as simply poor hardware performance. But when I spoke to early adopters, they consistently told me that yes, better performance was great, but equally important was demonstrating to their bossesNeedless to say, at the company above I immediately boosted the prominence of easy-to-understand reporting in all marketing and sales collateral. In general, the high-level story you tell customers, investors, and new hires should be built around answers to the following questions:The messaging on Facebook’s home page for non-members follows this approach exactly:As your company grows and its market matures, you may find it worthwhile to define a Darth Vader for each division, or even each product. Vaders can evolve, too. For example, Optimizely only recently adopted its current messaging; previously, its home page proclaimed, “A/B testing that you’ll actually use.” With cross-platform tracking becoming more important for online marketers — and, presumably, Optimizely alternatives getting easier to use — the new messaging reflects Optimizely’s understanding that its world has changed. Like Luke in the Star Wars sequels, its heroes have set their sights higher, and they now face new, more daunting challenges.Helping entrepreneurs tell strategic stories.

My life changed when I got a job at a startup. I was 19 years old, and just finished my first year of college. By some stroke of luck I managed to land a software engineering internship at a venture capital backed startup called UpTo in downtown Detroit, and actually stayed with them on and off throughout most of college.Startup jobs are infamously known to be hard to get. This is true. I applied 4 times for that internship through the Venture Capital firm that funded UpTo. I got ignored the first two times, rejected the third, and then finally got matched up with UpTo. To this day, I am convinced the only reason they finally accepted me was because I was such a pain in the ass.I’ll never forget the first day, especially that elevator ride up from the lobby to floor 3, where UpTo was. There were two other interns in the elevator with me, and we got on subject of where we went to school. The girl on my left went to Harvard, the guy on my right went to Stanford. I was shook.When the doors opened on floor 3, is when I first became aware of the startup dress code. If you have worked for a startup before, you are aware of this unwritten code. This code allows you to subconsciously gain a skill over time that allows you to identify someones role at a company just by what they are wearing. I won’t give away all the details, but it is usually along these lines. Developers have some variation of the Zuckerberg hoodie, designers have some sort of bright colored shoes, the business guys wear collared shirts, and the venture capitalists wear sweaters over a collared shirt. I fit into none of these categories that day, and stuck out like a sore thumb. Classic intern.When it came time for me to get assigned my first task, I had absolutely no idea how that hell to do it. I was asked to create a view that could draw a rectangle, with I had very little programming experience let alone iOS experience, but somehow I managed to get it done. That day, I learned perhaps the most valuable lesson a programmer could learn, which is of course, how to use Google. I took a picture of my finished rectangle and sent it to all my friends because for whatever reason I thought it was badass I could make an iPhone draw a rectangle.Even though the first days at UpTo were intimidating, after a while I began to realize what an amazing experience I was having. I couldn’t have dreamt of a better situation. My desk at UpTo was 2 feet away from a senior iOS Developer, and I got to ask him any question I could think of whenever I wanted. Just a few feet beyond that was the CTO, CEO, and lead designer. All of them, willing to answer any of my questions. On daily basis, my learning began to scale exponentially.The Friday of my second week, is when I really realized what startups were all about.It was the 2012 Detroit Venture Partners Pitch Day held at the Madison Theater. For those of you who don’t know what Pitch Days are, it’s where startups and investors from all over the world come together so startups can raise funding. The Madison Theater was jam packed. The atmosphere that day was Pitching a startup is an art form. The people pitching have to convince this room full of people that their company often times of which is currently losing money, to give them millions of dollars. If done correctly, with just the right amount of buzz words, and slides, they receive this funding. If done wrong, they will get the infamous “It’s a pass, for now.” from a venture capitalistAfter watching about a half dozen pitches, there was a break for lunch. We had Mudgie’s Deli catered in (A Detroit icon). As I was sitting there eating my Lockwood sandwich, I remember thinking just how interesting, but yet very odd, this scene was. There were probably a few hundred people in this room but all were wearing 1 of maybe 15 different T-Shirts that had their company name or logo on it. The CEO’s of course, wore a blazer over the T-Shirt. This is also when I learned about the black market of T-Shirt exchanges between startups. One does not simply give you their company T-Shirt. But I’ve said too much already, I swore I would never explain how that works to the outside world, so I’ll just leave it at that.As lunch was ending I noticed this familiar face coming towards me, but I couldn’t quite remember where I have seem him. I did however recognize the company name that was on his T-Shirt. After a few seconds it clicked. This was the dude that was on Shark Tank a while back! He gave me one of those nods you do when you see a friend across the room and proceeded to walk over. Now, I’ve been in this situation before, during my high school prom, when I saw the girl I liked waving at me, that didn’t work out so well. So this time, I remember thinking to myself, there is just no way he is acknowledging me. I did one of those head turns behind me to the right and left to see if anyone was behind me, but no one was. He was actually coming over. He said “UpTo, that sounded pretty cool, what do you do there?” (I was wearing my UpTo T-Shirt). I awkwardly mumbled that I was just an intern, but we still proceeded to have a conversation and we actually exchanged emails. That was my first networking connection!Pitch Day, was the first time I experienced people who did not just like, or even love, what they did for a living, they were obsessed with it. Think about that. Obsessed. Everyone in that room would do what they were doing if they didn’t get paid a dime to do it. You are probably thinking those people were crazy, but you are wrong. They were fucking nuts. Everyone in that room believed they were working on something that had the potential to disrupt industries and change the world, and let me tell you, that mindset is As the weeks went on that summer, my infatuation just kept growing. One of the most memorable memories I have, is the first time I saw someone I didn’t know use UpTo. I was on a flight to Chicago, and the girl next to me pulled it up on her iPhone. I’ve never done a drug in my life, but the feeling I got when I saw her use UpTo, has to be the same feeling. Seeing someone tap the button I programmed, and then interacting with a screen I designed, it is just something I cant even put into words.Although sadly, startups aren’t always this romantic. There are the times like when you get the 3:00 AM email after the release of a new update with the the subject “EVERYTHING IS BROKEN” and the body says something along the lines of “New update crashes 100% of all users upon app launch…fix plz…”. Then all of a sudden, the dev team assembles suspiciously quick on Hipchat, cowboy coding on prod to the sound of their phones vibrating with crash reports constantly coming in.I will never forget the memories I had as an intern, even though a good amount of them are pretty embarrassing. Like the time when I when I deleted all of UpTo’s files off of DropBox (Sorry Dave).In closing, I could spend hours trying to explain to you what working at a startup is like, but I am afraid if you have never been a part of one it might be a little lost on you.Luke@lukejgeigerEntrepreneur | iOS Developer | Sports Enthusiast | Rec League All-Star (Self Proclaimed)This is a collections for articles about business including startups, business developments, and management.

Iran strikes a ‘framework deal’ with E3+3 on nuclear issue. As a result, all sanctions will be lifted in the next 10 years. The financial sanctions are expected to be lifted first. It’s a new Iran, but what does that mean for Iranian startups? how about international investors/startups?For the last two years, Iran’s startup ecosystem has flourished. Iran has three seed accelerators already, a few VCs and incubators. eCommerce is growing at rocket high speed. Technology infrastructure improvements combined with huge middle income population means there are unprecedented opportunities. Iran is probably the biggest untapped market in Middle East with huge potentials.The financial sanctions crippled Iran’s economy. Iran lost access to the SWIFT network which meant no more cash flowing into Iran from other countries. Per today’s agreement, financial sanctions that prevent money transfers to Iran will be lifted first. It means foreign investors can start their research on Iranian startups and build a network. Angel investors can start their due diligence process on prospective startups. And growing startups can mark Iran as their next expansion market. Not surprisingly there are already a few investors from European countries in Iran. They know the importance of building a network in the country as early as possible. There have even been some highly-rumored and undisclosed investments.Perhaps it’s too early and risky to invest a lot of money in Iran. However, as the ecosystem is young and many startups are mostly in their early stages, small seed investments can be a great way to test the water. After all, in great risks are great rewards.Another approach could be investing through other local VC firms for now. It’s in the interest of local VCs to build this relationship and foreign investors can also get to know the market a little bit better. Ultimately, as the ecosystem grows, it’s good for everyone to pump in more money into this entrepreneurship engine.The more important effect of this deal would be optimism it will foster among the general public and entrepreneurs. The general public will (appropriately) see this deal as a sign of positive changes in the country and a better financial future. They will most likely spend more money and provide early stage startups with more traction.The entrepreneurs will reach high echelons of success once they find their market raise higher capital and access global markets and services. Their success will in turn encourage more of Iran’s youth to give entrepreneurship a try. Creating a positive cycle that can help mend Iran’s fragile, oil-dependent, economy.The more positive future can possibly encourage more youngsters to give entrepreneurship a try. For Iran, it is the quickest way to mend it’s fragile economy.You can get in touch with community builders and key players in Iran to learn more about startups in Iran. They are the best source of information. You can find a list of them at the end of this article. There are also links to accelerators, investors, and events.Please share/recommend this article.If there is anything you want me to write about, please leave a comment here.Founder of Learn more about Iran’s Startup Ecosystem

If you’ve read anything about the Philadelphia 76ers recently, it was probably written at their expense. At the start of the 2014–15 NBA season, Vegas’ over-under for Sixer victories was 16.5 games. Lowest in the league. Scratch that: But while the haters hate, the Sixers have been quietly going about their business. And, believe it or not, they are doing some So, how are they doing it? They’re beating the odds because some really clever and hard working people are finding ways to over-achieve.Cut to my professional life … my “team” is trying to beat the odds, too, by building I know, I know. Hear me out.You might think that playing for the most mocked team in the NBA would break one’s spirit. But damned if the Sixers don’t play their hearts out.Now, you can call it marketing, but it’s not I mean, come on:Entrepreneur types like to talk about the importance of great “company culture.” They(we?) also like to point out that this ethos means a lot more than just setting up a company ping pong table. So what The answer often seems pretty hand-wavy for something so damned important. And yesterday, listening to Sixers coach Brett Brown talk about his team, it struck me: culture is just a code word for caring a lot. For passion and aspiration. For dedication and ownership. It doesn’t matter whether you’re more of a “dog company” (as Google self-identified) or a “cat company”; it doesn’t matter whether you have a kegerator or a juicebar. That stuff’s fun. But these fringe benefits are definitively NOT why “culture” lands on everyone’s list of most important startup concerns. These benefits are, at best, mere mechanisms for nurturing a culture of ownership and caring.Establishing a habit of ‘no’ is a celebrated maxim of effective entrepreneurialism. It’s sort of about time management but, more than that, it’s about avoiding knee-jerk reactionism; about privileging vision and long term goals over the never ending stream of distractions.Has any entity practiced this maxim as daringly as the Sixers in the Sam Hinkie era? Their vision is to craft a championship team — a team with enough stars to be best team in the NBA — that can compete for multiple seasons in a row. Each and every decision is made to that end. If a player is good and well liked, but not essential to that vision (because he’s not good enough, or simply because of tactical considerations like contract, fit, etc..), the Sixers are willing to trade that player for a future asset that has a shot at helping to enable the overall vision.Yet the organization takes a TON of abuse for it. From fans and non-fans alike. It’s painful at times. People took the Michael Carter Williams trade personally.Entrepreneurs call these “hard decisions.” Ability to manage these hard decisions if often the difference between startup success and failure. The Sixers are walking the walk. (If Philadelphia fails to craft a championship-caliber team over the next five years, this lesson shall be deleted in its entirety and I will deny it ever existed.)Please let me take this moment to introduce you to Brett Brown, my favorite sports coach anywhere.Player Malcolm Thomas once said, “After each Sixers home game, I race back to the car to flip the radio on, just to listen to Brown give his post-game press conference. He always finds a way to thank the fans, but never in a cloying or put-on way. He supports his players, but never disingenuously.It’s precisely because Brown avoids blowing smoke up his audience’s bottoms, he succeeds so wildly at giving his audience hope.

Startups are on the rise, and according to the Kaufman Index for Startup Activity, “The Startup Activity Index rose in 2015, reversing a downward trend that started in 2010 in the middle of the Great Recession.” The reality is that nine out of ten startups fail because too many entrepreneurs stay in ‘startup mode’ way too long. Keeping a small business in startup mode leaves you standing on the brakes.It’s time to move from startup to grownup and from planning to doing.

This is one of the first photos, my wife, or my girlfriend at the time, and I were in together. It was taken a little over a month after we met, unbeknownst to us, by the photographer at her sister’s wedding.You can tell from this photo, that even from the beginning, we were inseparable.Love wasn’t always like that for me.My career, my family, myself, and my girlfriends were all distinct categories – file folders that were neatly compartmentalized, from most important to least, never touching, never interfering.At that time, in the fall of 2010, my career was taking me to London. So a month later, on a whim, I threw away my filing system, and asked her to quit her job, her life in Vancouver, and to join me in Europe.And she did.In London, and then Amsterdam, we started a life together. New friends, new cities, and the start of a family with the addition of our daughter, Maddy. A few years later, we returned home to Vancouver, where we began to plant our roots.I announced this to Michelle sometime after the new year in 2014. We had recently welcomed our son Markus into our family. We were building a little nest, were buying a new car, and had plans to purchase our first house. Those plans would have to change.She was the CEO of our home — a thankless, full-time job without pay – and I, the sole breadwinner and VP of Client Services at a big agency at the time, had just told her that I was going to take a leap of faith (without a parachute), and that by extension, she would be jumping too.She never hesitated.When we were first contemplating the start of We would start a business for ourselves, but also with the best intentions for our families. Family was so important to us, that we almost named our agency, Father.Doing a start-up is a selfish ask for a founder. You have a dream. Making that dream happen, requires 110% of your energy. And the ones that are closest to you, like my wife, are asked to come along for the ride.Sometimes this means, they get to hear all the details and weigh in on the many decisions you make when it comes to building something from scratch. Often they are offstage. They trust whole-heartedly that you know what you’re doing, because they love you, despite your own insecurities.They are always the first to jump up and clap in celebration of your victories. And also they’re the first to console you, when you come home, tail in-between your legs, having been kicked down that day. There’s been a few of those nights.But they’re always there, ever-present, ever-encouraging, ever-supporting of your dream.Being a founder not only means longer days, but a responsibility to the company, which includes being there for your partners and for your employees.But those responsibilities also need to be juggled with your other roles — in my case, as a husband, as a father of two, as a brother, and as a son.They say (But For Michelle, being my start-up wife, this has meant:I try my best to balance my life and I take pride in being there for my family. But the truth is, like all working spouses, I miss out on things.When I look back at my photos over the past year…… I feel two things:All I can say is thank you Michelle, for everything, and in particular for being the ever-present force, that’s allowed me to pursue this adventure.Co-founder of Modern Craft, an agency helping modern brands grow through better digital. 15 year agency guy, father, traveller, lover of vests, old fashions.

La desidia del fracaso.Tras Podría decirse que somos desarrolladores de software a medida pero en la práctica lo que ofrecemos es servicio. Soluciones. Y uno de los grandes problemas del momento actual del sector Ahí es donde entra MilloLab. Creamos plataformas crowdsourcing, especialmente En tan sólo 6 meses hemos creado una empresa con un objetivo claro, escasa competencia local, y con la experiencia de que los dos fundadores tuvimos una plataforma de crowdfunding con anterioridad.Seamos realistas, teníamos menos recursos todavía de los previstos. Cuando lo arriesgas todo en un negocio quemas todos los cartuchos que puedes. Si sale mal te quedas sin cartuchos y en el caso de MilloLab tanto mi socio Héctor como yo veníamos de una empresa en la que nos dejamos la piel. Simplemente pusimos en la mesa nuestro tiempo, habilidad y conocimiento.¿Ventajas? haber estado casi 2 años con Héctor trabajando hacía que el trabajo en MilloLab fuera mucho más fluido porque nos conocemos. Trabajamos a distancia: Héctor en Fuerteventura y yo en Zaragoza. Evidentemente nos vemos de vez en cuando en algún sitio intermedio.Así pues desarrollamos nuestra propia tecnología Lo siguiente que vino fue la ampliación de plantilla. Ahora somos entre 5 y 6 personas por proyecto y todos deslocalizados. Teniendo Slack, Trello, Telegram y Skype ¿para qué más?.El punto de inflexión llegó con los beneficios trimestrales. Estoy de acuerdo que una empresa con tan poco tiempo de vida no debería hacer balance de sus beneficios tan prematuramente pero seamos realistas. ¿Qué empresa tiene beneficios en los primeros 6 meses de vida? Es increíble. No nos los explicamos.Si alguien me pregunta por qué creo que hemos tenido éxito en el inicio de MilloLab creo que lo resumiría en una frase: “no tengo miedo”.Cuando trabajas muy duro, lo arriesgas todo y fracasas pierdes el miedo a fracasar o al menos de forma temporal. Es en ese momento cuando te das cuenta de que sin miedo afrontas el reto con mayor capacidad.De momento para nosotros es un éxito haber creado en tan poco tiempo una empresa sostenible en España y ya estamos trabajando en los planes de expansión del resto del año. ¿Burbuja? Todo éxito parece tener componentes de burbuja, es ahora nuestra responsabilidad convertir esos indicios en proyectos responsables. La humildad está marcada a fuego en el alma de MilloLab. Si tuviera que resumir todo esto: “hacemos lo que sabemos hacer y nos va bien”.Escribo, luego existo. CTO/Founder de MilloLab.Experiencias recopiladas

As a young art collector myself, I was inspired to build Kollecto through a personal frustration. I go to Spotify when I want recommendations for I figured there must be other people like me, who were interested in collecting art, but didn’t want to comb through hundreds of galleries and exhibits. So I built an app to give people affordable access to their own personal art buyer (fancy, right?).In the very early stages of building Kollecto, I was already stringing together various tools to build an MVP without needing to hire engineers. I had the idea for Kollecto floating around in my head, when I came across a side project bootcamp program called In the beginning, I used I’m a firm believer in releasing MVPs and iterating quickly, before devoting a ton of resources to a direction you’re not sure will stick. I was able to find out pretty quickly that Kollecto was something that not only my customers wanted, but that art advisors and galleries wanted too.By the time Kollecto was accepted into the 500 Startups Accelerator, we already had over 400 active users and around $30k in art sales. I continued to refine the code-free tools we leveraged, adding Stringing together a bunch of tools had worked well to this point, but once we hit ~1500 monthly active users things began to fall apart.The main issue was relying on human labor. Each time a new user signed up, an Art Advisor would have to manually find art for them. Then a virtual assistant would upload hundreds of art recommendations into our survey-based app. The process moved quickly when we had several hundreds users, but it was impossible to manage for thousands at once.At the most hectic moment, I remember starting to feel embarrassed of the product. There was a period where users had to wait 3 weeks for their first art recommendations.We had outgrown our ‘product’ and something had to give.About mid-way through the 500 Startups program, I came across Bubble on Product Hunt [sidenote: they were recently By the time I finished with 500 startups, I had a fully functioning app on Bubble! Now, instead of managing handfuls of tools — from website builders to form generators — everything I needed to manage was on one platform. We still used Art Advisors to categorize art using our internal taxonomy. But the crux of Kollecto’s functionality and ability to scale now rested on the art-matching algorithm; something that, before Bubble, was impossible to integrate without code.My advice to non-technical founders, or designers who are looking to quickly wireframe their ideas, or even coders who want to more quickly release an MVP before committing to a direction: try Founder Everything about Bubble’s product, users and vision  —  

When I transitioned onto the product team at my company two months ago, I knew I wanted to level up as a designer, especially since our company was growing quickly. But when I looked to books and online communities for insight, most of what I could find focused more on So I turned to two designer friends: At startups, there likely isn’t a typical path for professional development in place—in fact, if you’re working at a high-growth startup, you might find At a growing startup, one person may be both a design manager and a design lead. But in a few months, that (and any structure you have now) may change. Understand what paths typically exist so that if you know which path you want to be on, you can plan to develop the skills you’ll need to grow into that path today, and if you don’t, you’ll know what to explore to figure out which is right for you. For example, if you want to be an expert designer, you might focus on picking up a new prototyping framework. Or, if you want to be a design lead, you might focus on getting staffed on a project to help you understand how to work better with engineering leads and product managers.For training, Missy recommends Great designers want to work with great designers, and while hiring might not be a part of your official job description, doing what you can to help your talent team Tabitha’s Meanwhile, Missy’s design team at The Hunt consists of 4 people: 1 user researcher, 2 mid-level/senior product designers, and 1 senior interaction designer. Early on, they had one product designer and one user researcher. They then brought an interaction designer, and another product designer, to build the team they have now. Currently, for every feature, one of the two product designers serves as the design lead and prototyper, and the user researcher and interaction designer support. Missy recalls a major lesson learned, “At one point, we tried having one designer on iOS and one designer on Android, but then we ended up with features that would be on one platform but not the other, so we re-organized into what we have now, where one product designer works on a feature for both platforms.” This demonstrates the importance of hiring designers who can design experiences for your product across platforms.Start thinking about how your team is structured currently. Do you see any parallels with the situations described above? If you have strong UX research and interaction design skills and product managers/engineering leads who understand and value great design, it might make sense to hire a specialist in visual and UI design as your next designer. But if you need to ship new features quickly and often and need a designer who can design a new feature end-to-end, it might make sense to hire a generalist as your next designer. If both those apply, perhaps you’re looking for a designer with a very strong visual and UI design background but looking to level up in interaction design.Making this recommendation to your talent team isn’t easy because it requires being vulnerable. As one of few designers at a startup, people likely currently look to you as the expert on everything UX. Helping your talent team hire the right next designer to complement your team requires being honest with yourself about your weaknesses and admitting that you’re not, in fact, the expert on everything UX. However, it’s one of the most high leverage activities you can do to not only help you level up as a designer, but also help move the business forward.One of the best parts of working at a startup is that even as one individual, you can have a significant effect on the company culture. At a more granular level, you can also impact the culture of your department.Here are two examples:At Khan Academy, the team does a retrospective after every major project because they want to encourage a design culture where people give feedback all the time. One launch was focused on promoting an interactive learning content product, a personal trainer for learning math. But when the team re-examined their user research, they realized that many users were more interested in immediate, on-demand help rather than a guided learning experience that required more time investment. Now, the design team leverages Having worked at both small startups and large companies, Missy can speak to several different product design processes. At StackMob, the design process was faster, more ad-hoc, and there was more autonomy. At larger companies, they would use more formal software development methodologies (scrum, waterfall), so design happened early on. This is a stark contrast to the more agile process at The Hunt, in which product designers and engineers work more closely together, with designers providing design feedback as engineers build and engineers providing engineering feedback as designers ideate and sketch. When it comes to questioning process, Missy cautions against working with contractors and agencies on major product initiatives. However, if you do, question if your current process is adequate and if not, adapt communication in your design process with the understanding that you’ll be working with someone externally. For example, when they worked with an outside agency for some work on their Android app, the agency designer offered final design assets in Photoshop, even though their internal design team used Sketch. With some questioning of the process and additional communication, they could have skirted this issue.There is no one-size-fits-all process. In every product or feature you design, question the process so that what you design meets user goals and the process is adapted, if needed, for a particular project.In the past month since I interviewed Tabitha and Missy, I’ve already applied what I’ve learned from them to level up as a designer. On the professional development front, I’ve identified the path I want to be on and articulated it to my manager, will be attending a conference this month to level up on my UX research and design strategy skills, and have interviewed six other designers/PMs (more writings to come!). On the talent front, I’ve made recommendations on our design hiring strategy to our head of product and our head of talent, designed recruiting collateral for our fall recruiting tour, and helped identify the level of seniority and kind of background we want in our next design hire (If you found this post helpful and/or if you’re interested in being featured in a future post, please reach out.

It’s almost unbearable to watch — like a train wreck in slow motion — but then, just as those government agents are about to nab him, the time machine works, roll credits. Bam!It’s a moment of sudden magical realism and it’s what every big-dreaming startup founder should be caked in. The best founders are visionaries, maybe even mad scientists. Their job is to take us into the future, to look past the myopia, to skip over some of the details. There will be plenty of people who question and even ridicule their idea, those who would just rather wait and see. In fact, if you’re creating something that everyone is immediately on-board with, you might be doing something wrong.If you’re Silicon Valley old school — we’re talking 2011 here — you might remember a company called Color. It was the super group of startups, with $40,000,000 in funding from Sequoia Capital, Bain Capital and Silicon Valley Bank. The domain name Color.com was itself bought by the founders in December 2010 for $350,000. It was at that time perhaps the most-hyped launch in the history of the Valley. But the app was plagued by, well, sucking: Its initial rating in the App Store was 2 out of 5, despite having around 1 million downloads. By September 2011, there were around 100,000 active users. In 2012, the board of directors voted to shut it down.Everyone involved should have watched But these two examples, by today’s standards, are just small change. It’s almost Do you want to be a young, scrappy Marlon Brando or a bloated Dr. Moreau? Does your office need catered meals and massages Which do you remember: Steven Tyler’s But this doppelganger effect is actually even more prevalent in Silicon Valley. For every Munchery there’s Din, Blue Apron, Sprig, Caviar, and Eat24. There are at least three competing car valet services (Luxe, Zirx and Caarbon), and they are just the ones in San Francisco! The venture sharks swarm at the glint of silicon gold, the funding ensues, and there will be blood.But is this necessarily a bad thing? Rivals keep you (relatively) honest and foster creative competition on product ideas, pricing, and even hiring. You’d have to believe that Uber’s surge pricing would be (even more) out of hand if it weren’t for Lyft. The customer wins with competition as companies push and pull to win the fierce battle for not just new customers, but loyalty.Even if you don’t have a direct and obvious competitor, get your marketing wonks to help position you as such.

Startups act like they invented testing, but Hollywood has been doing it for years. Studio execs might get in the way of originality and creativity but they’re also keenly aware at times of the bottom line. Wait, that’s all they are aware of.

Start-ups, entrepreneur. Two words which seem to have exploded onto the internet, conference scene and general consciousness like a tomato hitting the floor after falling sixteen floors.There’s a few bits and pieces which are seldom mentioned in the rhetoric which has become the start-up “business”. And it is a business; there’s probably more money made from start-up conferences than there is generated from the energetic attendees.Firstly, apart from the very odd exception, a start-up is never born out of the wish to create one. The very desire to create your start-up and then hunt for an idea is inherently wrong. A start-up pops into existence when someone has been thinking about a subject, dear to their heart, for a long time. It’s more a burning desire to do something which is linked to an interest they’ve harboured for donkeys years, an interest which they know the dark corners and odd wrinkles about.What’s the alternative? That you create a new spin on something which is ubiquitous? Your chances of being raised above the hub-bub of static and your idea gaining traction is next to zero.An interest lead start-up is likely to have a resonance with its audience, it’s attuned to the conditions, and it caters for the specifics of the subject, business domain or itch requiring a scratch.Even if we discount all that stuff, if your idea is generic, like a new way to socialise online, what are chances that this hasn’t already been done? As a numbers game, pretty high.The journey of the entrepreneur is some hard yards; there’s the sleepless nights, the sweaty hands moments, the server issues, staff problems, consistent revenue targets, the mortgage, the list is long. If you’re heading into a start-up, to create a start-up, your level of resilience to these obstacles is likely to dwindle and you’ll end up throwing in the towel or choosing a direction for all the wrong reasons.Do what you enjoy doing, find a way to do it and get paid, understand it to a greater level of detail. Live it. And then, maybe, one day you’ll wake up and this idea will be tugging at the bottom of your jumper, waiting to be heard. This is the start. But it’s not a start-up. It’s a start, now you need to follow the trail of crumbs. Has this idea got enough potential to make a living out of? How will I build it? How will I take it to market? Who will I need help from? How defensible is it? Has it been done before? And a good few other questions need to be answered.It might not be the right idea, because the execution of it has too much risk without reasonable reward from the market opportunity. Don’t worry. You enjoy what you’re doing, sit back, and keep doing it. The next idea might tick all the boxes and give you the best chance at success.Entrepreneur and innovator of market places, their creation and transformation. Im posting for my own amusement only.

You’ve probably noticed the ongoing debate about whether or not we’re in a tech bubble. Headlines are always gushing about the latest companies with billion dollar valuations.There’s a lot of investment capital out there right now, and if you’re a startup founder who hopes to raise money, you might be wondering what it takes to attract some of that capital to you .You have to figure out what to say to attract investors, but here’s the thing: depending on whether it’s your first fundraise or a follow-on round, you have to take a different approach.So, what do investors look for in a startup ripe for Series A versus Series B?

Since last August 24 we’ve been experiencing an economic crisis triggered mainly by what was called the “Black Monday”. China’s stock market dropped 8.5% in one day, wiping out trillions of dollars of market value in China and aboutIn any case, it is important to understand how this affects startups and Venture Capital industry where the cycles are much more long-term than in capital markets but are clearly influenced by valuations and expectations of exits and funding.These are a set of the short term recommendations and a waiting period for the fog to dissipate. Like all general recommendations each case may have exceptions.If the crisis deepens, it is expected that valuations will fall significantly, both in new rounds of capital and valuation of the portfolio. More MA transactions and fewer rounds with gigantic valuations are expected. Although it is a good time to start a company — as the economic cycle allows you to grow the company along with the economy and for investors to go out on a peak market valuations — it is a bad time to try to sell today or raise capital by necessity.

They say remarkable startups tend to be born in a garage. Most often in sunny California, the proverbial cradle of new technologies.As I write these words, I do sit on a tiny IKEA couch in a small garage. Except, I don’t work here. It’s where me and one of my co-founders live. And it’s not in Silicon Valley, but under the cloud-laden London skies.The average rent for a standard apartment was beyond our means so we found a refurbished room that, in better times, used to serve as a car park. We moved here to participate in a 3-month startup accelerator, which, more than anything, pushed our team to move for a limited period of time under the roof of Google Campus, and to replace Skype meetings with some intensive work side by side.I’ve never dreamt about building a startup. It hasn’t been so long since the time when I would not have been able to define what exactly this word meant. It just somehow happened that, after I’d spent many weeks trying to find a solution to something that had been bothering me for a while, it came to me that without founding a “real” company, only few would take me seriously.To emphasize this point, please bear in mind that I am a) a woman, b) a non-engineer, c) Czech (i.e. from the “East” of Europe as people like to remind me when they glance over my tall figure and Slavic looks).And while I was sowing the seeds of a future online platform on a shoestring budget, not knowing where exactly my endeavors would eventually lead, I figured that my project could qualify as an innovation experiment — one of those that, from time to time, turn crazy people into billionaires, or rather more often end up in dried-up bank accounts and painful failures.My last well-paid job had seen me in Brussels, working at one of the EU institutions. Back then, I had something that I am palpably lacking now — security. The material one, most of all. But something was driving me out of my comfortable office, into adventures, travel, and self-exploration. That’s why one day I quit my job, donated a lot of my clothes to charity, and moved to Lebanon, a country whose language I didn’t speak and where I didn’t know a single soul.I fought bravely for all that, up until a point where I was courageous enough, and not completely broke yet, to think about starting my own business.Even as a complete beginner, I was able to find resources that helped me start my first blog, build my first website, learn about SEO, issue invoices, track my expenses, or manage my marketing campaigns. The more I learned about the tools I found after hours of googling, the more I realized that many people around me didn’t know about them at all.The Alice in me peeked into the Wonderland behind the mirror of ones and zeros, and she refused to return without bringing something back.When the conflict in neighboring Syria got nastier, I moved to the peaceful and lush Bali, where, with the help of a simple website builder, I put together a first version of The design was being brought to life in Beirut, the code in Prague, and the content in Marrakech, until the call of the garage mentioned above brought some of us together in the land of the Queen.Our stay here in London has been overflowing with amazing experiences and we have had a chance to meet many competent professionals who helped us steer the startup in the right direction. Yet, bound by our nature and the vision behind MAQTOOB, we’ve recently felt very strongly that it’s time to hit the road once again.For startups in the likes of London, Berlin, Singapore, or San Francisco, it’s rather easy to learn about newest services that make our lives so much easier, be it apps for finance management, creating to-do lists, chatting with a remote team, or receiving online payments. We take it for granted that “there’s an app for everything” and we can’t by far imagine running our businesses without our smartphones and laptops.When we organize our workshops, introducing handy tools that help entrepreneurs improve their productivity, we are always almost ashamed to bring up the “obvious suspects”, such as Trello and Buffer to give an example. But again and again we are astonished to learn that majority of people have very limited knowledge of these, as well as of other apps that are pretty familiar to the startup community. And that is to refer to the people we meet in the heart of the Tech City.Me and my co-founder That’s why we’ve made the uneasy decision not to continue networking and fund-raising in Europe in the months to come, but instead to pass the next year visiting 12 countries that are on the rise in their respective regions. Starting April 2015 through March 2016, we want to spend one month in each Lebanon, Morocco, Iran, Nigeria, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, and India, in order to meet local entrepreneurs and organize workshops where we introduce essential business tools and discuss bare fundamentals, such as how to build a website on your own, how to establish social presence, or how to sell stuff online.We see the platform we have built as a mere starting point to help us connect with the growing community of a new breed of entrepreneurs who aren’t afraid to embrace their freedom of choice. We like to choose if to work from an office, a coffee shop or our bedroom; we like to combine business and travel; we prefer to spend less time on tasks that can be automated; and we want to be more with our families and friends.Our choice was to take a risk and go the unconventional way — unconventional for a startup, whose existence is by definition more than fragile. The path we’re embarking on is driven by a need for a bridge between the world of technology and the world of small business.We hope to meet our target users instead of waiting for them to come to us. And more than anything, we want to learn from entrepreneurs we meet along the way.and she was that girl who wanted to be happy | CEO 

Startup jargon is infectious. The more contact you have with it the more likely you are to carry and spread it to others. Unfortunately, because of its viral nature, startup jargon has also mutated beyond its original meaning. Abusers, free of any true connection to real meaning, now use jargon to exaggerate the impact of their ideas: apps have become platforms; sales representatives have become evangelists; and products have become revolutionary. In an effort to appear stronger, startup culture has accidentally created weaker words and phrases — mere buzzwords, catchphrases and fillers for real communication.Below is a list of startup jargon to ban from your speech. These are the words and phrases to stop using because, more often that not, they don’t clarify the subject, they confuse it.What would you add to this list?The one stop source for Chicago Tech stories

Since mid-April 2014, Cintrifuse’s membership has grown from 28 to 171 startups. That’s over 500% growth in 12 months!In this blog, the second in a four-part series on “#StartupCincy by the Numbers”, I focus on the makeup of Cintrifuse’s current membership which can be viewed as a baseline for In case you missed my Once startups were “tagged” with data from each category, we finally had a thorough profile that could be used to execute our programs. Take a look at Pretty good picture of a company in 15 seconds, I’d say. Each of these data points can be mixed and matched as building blocks for our Mentor and Advisor Network programs as well as Customer Connections and Funding Connections.We’ll explain more about the practical implementation of this exercise in blog 4 but for now let’s focus on aggregate stats for Cintrifuse’s 171 startups. Only the top 3–5 statistical data sets are revealed in the body of the blog. For your reference, Here’s a breakdown of each category.#StartupCincy’s top ranking industry isn’t surprising. IT/Software dominates our member base as it does with most startup ecosystems in the modern world (the We created the “Innovation Category” field specifically for Customer Connections. It answers a basic question: “Why would a corporation do business with a startup?” This information gives Katie Austing, Jeff Carr, and Wendy Lea a mechanism to understand a corporation’s objective for working with a startup.From an outsider’s perspective, Innovation Category could be mislabeled because none of these options are describing innovative or disruptive technologies. That said, the data is still practical and an important piece of every Customer Connections narrative.In total, Cintrifuse identified 26 Solution Categories with 87 sub-categories under them. I won’t list them all because there are so many but you can view all solution categories/sub-categories The purpose of the Solution Category/Sub-category is to quickly answer the question, “What does it do?” Obviously this is a critical component of any startup’s profile. But rather than relying on longer descriptions provided by startups (which often contain “marketing speak”) our solution categories cut right to the chase.Now that you have the big picture, let’s drill down to see what’s in each Solution Category.A Collaboration/Productivity Tool is any platform that makes communicating and/or working more efficient through digital transmission. As you’ll see, there are several flavors.Two examples include Curated Web platforms or websites are those that display content from multiple authors, videographers, artists, etc. for general consumption. Most content aggregators attempt to derive revenue through advertising dollars. Streaming Content companies skew toward subscriptions.Right now we only have two sub-categories for Curated Web. There could be more but, based on the startups in #StartupCincy, there isn’t a need to add others.Consumer products, also referred to as Consumer Packaged Goods, are items purchased for personal consumption. While not all Consumer Products companies fit Cintrifuse’s model of high-growth, highly scalable, venture backable companies, there are some that do.For example, Two other Shark Tank alums, Software that helps manage, publish, and promote content and other marketing campaigns falls into our Marketing Automation/CMS category. Like Collaboration/Productivity Tool, this is a broad classification so it has several diverse sub-categories.Some examples from #StartupCincy include The term “big data” is everywhere. We classified Big Data Analytics companies as those with tools or a platform to help companies corral and make sense of their data.As we reviewed our taxonomy with The number of Cintrifuse’s startups selling to businesses trumped those selling direct to consumer. That said, we’re seeing a growing number of “hybrid” companies — those whose end-user is a consumer but they also find a revenue streams selling data or affiliate deals to businesses.Clearly data is now viewed as an Differentiating “Buyer Type” and “End-user Type” helps Cintrifuse set the right sales expectation between startups and customers. Consider this scenario: a startup sells a business an application that plugs into their website. The end-user would be the business’ customer, not necessarily the business itself.It’s important for Cintrifuse to make this distinction for our Customer Connections program. The reason being trust. Startups trust that we’re going to position them correctly to potential customers and those customers, the corporations in town, trust that our introductions will fulfill their innovation needs. So, in short, we need to understand a startup’s customer lifecycle to satisfy both parties.Functional Category, much like, Buyer Type and End-user Type, help us set the right sales expectation between startups and Customers.For Cintrifuse to open doors for startups, we have to know which doors to open. So we created “Functional Category” to outline which line of business a startup should meet.You’re probably starting to see a correlation between several of these categories. Most B2C and Consumer “End-user” companies are direct to consumer (DTC). That, along with a relatively even distribution across B2B functions, caused our “N/A — Individual” field to be much higher than others.I struggled creating the “Tech Deployment Method” category the most. People tend to view “Mobile” and “SaaS” (one element of Cloud Computing) as distinct industries. I don’t see it that way.To me, Mobile and SaaS Cloud Computing are distribution mechanisms on which applications and other programs are accessed. So, I went against the grain and kept them out of the “top level” categories.I also struggled with how to classify companies that don’t have a product that can be distributed via technology (no cloud, mobile, or e-commerce platform). I referenced Not to say these companies don’t have technology — couldn’t be further from the truth with The results of the Investment Category were the most revealing to me. As you can see, a whopping 45% of Cintrifuse’s startups are bootstrapping! The best comparable statistic I could find came from the Combine bootstraping startups and seed funed startups (this includes low dollar investments from accelerators*) and Are you “statted” out yet?Take some time to digest what’s in this blog because in the third and fourth installments I’ll talk about gaps in the region and what Cintrifuse is doing to solve them. Specifically, I’ll round out the #StartupCincy by the Numbers” blog series by summarizing how we’re leveraging this analysis to improve our programs and make #StartupCincy a community where talented entrepreneurs want to be!Start-up Founder, Entrepreneur, Business Analyst, Traveler, Father

As I approach my final days at #1 #2 #3 #4 #5#6#7#8 #9#10 #11 #12 #13 #14 #15 #16 #17#18 #19 #20I’m obsessed with the Internet and getting shit done. I get very excited by great companies. Previously founder 

Contrary to what you may believe, there is a proven formula for raising capital. It’s what the world’s best CEOs and expert fundraisers have been using for decades. And now with fundraising and investing moving online, this formula can be amplified, and exponentially more valuable to you.As we’ve shared this formula with founders raising on Crowdfunder, the data shows that those who follow this formula raise ten times the amount of investment as those who don’t. Founders who follow the formula on Crowdfunder attract $240,000 (founders who don’t raise only $24K). Founders who follow the formula close money 50% of the time from interested investors, whereas founders who don’t close less than 10% of the time.I will show you how to hack this matrix, but first you need to understand what the agents are doing…Last year in 2014, over 70,000 startups got $24 Billion in seed funding from 300,000 investors. The number of funded startups has doubled since 2002; and the data shows that even when total investment dollars drops — as it did during the 2008 financial meltdown — the number of startups getting funded (as well as the number of investors) has steadily increased each year.But this is just the tip of the iceberg for what’s coming.The Small Business Administration notes that 6.5 million new businesses are started each year in the U.S., and there are an estimated 6 million U.S. investors who are qualified to invest in startups today. Once the final piece of By contrast, there is roughly $20 Trillion invested in fewer than 20,000 public companies. Quantitative modeling and flash trading has already taken over Wall Street, making it difficult to impossible for a professional investor to make more than the historical average of 9% in the public stock market. One successful hedge fund manager recently admitted to me that he was thinking about closing his fund because he can’t justify taking his normal fees given how efficient the market is these days.Back in 2013 I gave a Two years later, the quantification of venture capital has started, see As more data and transparency comes into the startup investing process, more angels and VCs are realizing the virtues of a mathematical approach. And the math says that the correct approach with startups is to massively diversify. Dave McClure of 500 Startups has gone as far as to suggest that VCs who ignore the math are “gambling with [their investors’] money”.These trends are all great news for you as a founder raising capital — if you understand how to unlock it and not get lost in the noise….Everybody wants to invest in the Next Big Thing, but nobody wants to be the first to invest. Two reasons for this. First is that, if I lead and nobody follows, you will be undercapitalized; which means I’ve just made a bad investment. The second reason is that we investors are social creatures, and we need the validation of other investors in your deal before we will commit.Thus, there is no such thing as an “objectively fundable” company. And because of this, the funding matrix is hackable. One of the main keys to hacking it is Social currency is the trust, goodwill and credibility you have within your network, and more generally with your brand and reputation. Every person has it, and every company does too. While it may be invisible, social currency is what breathes life into startups, and transforms pure ideas into massive enterprises. Mastering social currency is what can take your deal from unfundable one day to oversubscribed the next.Take for instance Neil Young. While he had a massive following as a musician, nobody would have believed he could launch one of the hottest technology startups of 2014. But he did, and he used his social currency to do so.The first thing he did was get all of his influential musician friends to participate in a While you may be quick to dismiss Neil Young’s crowdfunding success because he was already famous, The key to their success is always the same: leveraging their social currency and transforming it into investment capital.Your campaign will consist of five phases:While you don’t have to run the public portion, I personally believe this is like playing tennis with a wooden racket today. Here’s why. Until the recent JOBS Act, it was illegal to run a public investment campaign for a startup. And because of this, the entire industry became accustomed to working within the restrictions, and frankly, we became gunshy. Which means there’s a near-term opportunity for early adopters to take advantage of the advantage, before everyone else catches on. So I’m going to assume you will run a public portion, but if not, you can just skip Phase 4.Also, I’m going to assume you will use the Crowdfunder platform (or another online platform). Sure you could run your campaign entirely offline like in the old days. But consider what that signals to your investors, especially if you are a tech company. Also, the power of the internet combined with the JOBS Act changes makes online fundraising the perfect complement your offline efforts.With those caveats out of the way, here we go down the rabbit hole….In order to close investors, you will first build your social currency using your company’s Each of your stakeholders should have a Next make sure everyone The final step once your stakeholders are onboard is to use your social currency to activate three key groups: potential lead investors, your broader social network and the general public. You will work on these tasks simultaneously and thoroughly before moving on to Phase 2.You find a lead investor by targeting your hitlist of ideal leads, methodically going about meeting each of them, and forming good relationship with each. They might already be on Crowdfunder, but even if not, you can use the six degrees of separation principle with your friends and colleagues to get to each investor on your hitlist. If you’re not sure who would make a good lead investor, Target ten potential lead investors and don’t stop until you meet all of them (or find suitable substitutes). Ideally, you want tenShare your plans for the company, and specifically what you are doing between now and when you do open your round. Make sure whatever you tell them, you work hard to do it. Then report back to them on your progress, even if you fail to meet your goals. Investors look for founders who show this type of transparency and followthrough.Even if none of your hitlist ends up becoming your lead investor, you will have tenThis is where you max out your LinkedIn, Facebook and rolodex. Let your friends and colleagues know you will be opening an investment round soon with a professional lead investor. Let them know that if they want to get in before the rush, they should Follow you on Crowdfunder. Also ask them for introductions to their friends and colleagues who would Don’t forget about your best business relationships, especially your best customers and strategic partners.Whenever possible, meet with prospective investors in person or video chat. Just as with the lead investor, build a relationship. Let them know you will come back to them once you have chosen a lead (who will set the investment terms).Keep detailed notes on each meeting and each person, especially the reasons why they invest, what size investments they typically make, and what Make sure everyone you speak to Follows your company. If you need to couch it as a favor, do so. This is proper use of your social currency, which will pay dividends later on as your campaign unfolds.Back in 2012, Mike Del Ponte revealed to Tim Ferris how he The operative concept is that you are “engineering overnight success” at least a month ahead of your public launch. It’s a numbers game. For instance, lets say you are raising $500,000. If you can reach a collective audience of 100,000, then get 1% of them to click through, then get 10% of those to make to make investment reservations, and then close 10% of those people to invest $50K each, then you’ve reached your goal.One advantage you have over most Kickstarter campaigns is that you likely already have a customer base, user base, or some sort of product/service offering that you can use to get the word out. That’s in addition to the buzz generation techniques that Mike outlines above. One of the biggest mistakes I see founders make is being reluctant to message their users/customers about their investment round. But what better candidate to invest in your company than someone who already knows and loves what you do?The other advantage of equity crowdfunding is that you can incentivize interested investors with your product/service in the form of Investor Perks. Investor Perks work similarly to Kickstarter Rewards in that the more money someone invests, the more value you give them in the form of Perks. For example, As a prospective investor, this is a fantastic value for me. In my mind, I know the investment is risky and I could lose everything. However, if I receive fair market value in product for my investment too, then I feel like a return on the equity is somewhat of a bonus. In my mind, the Perk has “de-risked” my investment.While Investor Perks are not always appropriate, they can turn a difficult close into an easy one. If you do add Investor Perks make sure they are value-aligned with your company’s mission and products. And don’t be afraid to be creative. Sometimes the best Perks are unique experiences with little hard cost to you but huge perceived value to your investors.Part of what you have told your prospective lead investors in Phase 1 are the milestones you will achieve before you are ready to open your round. You will also have gotten feedback from them to make sure you are setting the right milestones. Once you achieve the milestones, go back to each of your prospects and close them.If you have achieved your milestones and there are still objections, then those people are probably not going to invest. Let them know you are interviewing other lead investors and will come back to them if there is still room in the round.The terms under which you close your lead investor is a matter of negotiation. There is no right answer, but both you and the investor will each have a range of acceptable terms, for example a range of acceptable valuations for the company. Assuming there is overlap in your respective ranges, then there is a zone of possible agreement. Where in that range you end up is what’s being negotiated.The way you get the best deal possible for yourself (and existing shareholders) is by having the option to walk away from the deal. And you only have that option if you either don’t need investment, or you have multiple investors you are negotiating with simultaneously. This is where your work in the previous phase begins to pay off.Once you have closed a lead investor, you can begin closing people from your network.Your pitch is online at Crowdfunder, as are all Your supporting documents, such as financials and disclosures. And through your efforts in Phase 1, a good portion of your network is now Following your company. Send them a message announcing the lead investor. Then reach out to each person directly via email/text/phone to set up a closing call or meeting. Make sure to reach out to everyone you spoke to, even if they are not Following your company.To close investors, set up group calls and meetings if possible. This creates the proper signaling to investors that your time is limited, and that there are many other investors looking at your deal. (It’s the same dynamic created by having an open house just once a week when you are selling your house). If grouping is not possible for certain investors, limit your call to 15 minutes.Once they have agreed to speak, direct them to your online pitch and documents and urge them to review prior to your call/meeting. This does several important things: (1) gets them invested in your deal with their time/attention (2) sets the proper expectations that the call won’t be to pitch them, but rather to close them (3) filters out the tire-kickers from the buyers.Before you speak to anyone, make sure that the major questions and objections (which will inevitably come up) are thoroughly and clearly addressed in your pitch and diligence documents. For less important questions, you should maintain an online FAQ and update it when new objections or question arise. Then, when you are speaking with investors, instead of answering questions that can be found in the FAQ, politely remind them that these details can be found on Crowdfunder. Tell them you want to be respectful of their time (and your own) by sticking to the most important, high level items that are make-or-break for their investment.Reserve part of the time to interview the investor about what makes them a good investor for your company. Ask them what they plan to contribute besides capital — Use Crowdfunder’s The more interest and momentum you share with investors who are looking at your deal, the more excited and likely they will be into invest (remember, you’re “unfundable until oversubscribed….”)Finally, you should end every closing conversation with investors by giving them a deadline for their decision and for getting their money wired. Let them know that the public campaign will begin after the deadline, and they will lose their spot if they miss the deadline.The more of your online campaign goal you have already closed from your own network, the easier it will be to attract and close investors from the Crowdfunder network, and the public at large. Having lots of interest from the public is also good signaling for folks in your network who are on the fence.There is no hard and fast rule, but I like to close 70% of my fundraising goal privately, before letting the public in. Note that you are always free to take in more than 100% of your stated goal, as long as your investment documents allow for that.Once your deal is public you will have to take active steps to verify that investors coming in are accredited. Crowdfunder will help you with this if you ask, just email The final phase of your campaign is to let everyone know the good news of your success. Remember, your ultimate goal is to build a successful business and serve your customers; the investment capital you raised is simply a means to that end. With your successful raise, you have just built up new social currency, which you can utilize to grow sales and build your brand.The first people to contact are those lucky folks who invested. Congratulate them and welcome them aboard. Most importantly let them know how they can help you build the business, and hence increase the value of their equity.Next, you should contact everyone who you touched in the campaign process, even if they didn’t invest. This includes all the folks who expressed interest in your deal on Crowdfunder but didn’t invest for whatever reason.Finally, you should let the world know through PR and social media. Here’s a I’ve just showed you how to hack the startup fundraising matrix by planning and executing a five phase campaign using your social currency. Now you have to jump in and start. You won’t be perfect, and that’s okay. Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Here are some tools and resources to help:I also highly recommend listening to every episode of Gimlet Media’s Finally, here are some matrix subroutines to reflect on…Imagine you are rolling out your first product to the world but nobody knows about it (or you) yet. So to build awareness and demand — and to bring in some capital to help you launch your product — you decide to create a unique, limited edition, exclusive offering that you will sell to tastemakers and wealthy buyers, who in turn will later help make your big product launch a success. How would you go about creating a campaign for your exclusive offering?Since your offering is limited, and since you have the ability to say who gets in and who doesn’t, you might look to the world of night club promotion. The technique is simple: get a buzz going about it well in advance by having tastemakers spread the word; then leak to the press which celebrities will be in the VIP room; finally, set up a velvet rope at the door of the nightclub.The velvet rope serves two purposes. The first is to make a giant spectacle of how much demand there is to get into the club (i.e. demonstrate your social currency). The second is to publicly pick and choose the lucky few who will get in, thereby making them feel very special and fortunate to know you. Simultaneously you are building up demand for your product launch with those who are locked outside the velvet rope. These things together create even more demand, and tell a story worthy of press coverage having nothing to do with what’s inside the club!The exclusive offering, of course, is the equity in your company. The celebrities are your lead investors. The tastemakers are your private network, especially those who are investing. And the press is, well, the press… plus social media and whatever other channels you have to get the word out as far and wide as possible.Sign up on Crowdfunder and Follow me: Co-Founder,  Crowdfunder

Atualmente há muita discussão em torno da eficiência de uma corporação grande e consolidada e uma startup. Startups possuem equipes menores que podem tomar decisões mais rápidas. As decisões não tem que subir toda a cadeia hierárquica dentro da empresa. Em uma startup, uma ideia é formulada, você pode executar rapidamente e fazê-la acontecer. Se falhar, aprende com os erros, se reagrupa e tenta outro caminho.As grandes empresas adorariam ser mais rápidas e ágeis para os mercados de hoje. Existem muitos talentos e ideias dentro dessas corporações, mas com frequência esbarram em processos burocráticos na hora de tomar decisões. Se as empresas maiores operassem como startups com diversos times menores, identificando oportunidades e tomando decisões, elas poderiam ser bem-sucedidas neste sentido.Uma forma que as empresas encontraram de assimilar a mentalidade de startup é encorajando os funcionários a trabalhar em espaços de coworking. Esses espaços são como ímãs de talento, dando às pessoas — principalmente empreendedores — a possibilidade de interagir e conhecer pessoas, enquanto proporciona um fluxo adicional de criatividade. Hoje em dia é possível ver algumas companhias que encorajam seus empregados a tirar um dia ou dois para ir trabalhar em um espaço de coworking. Ao fazer isso, você está permitindo que os funcionários sintam-se como empreendedores. Passando algum tempo neste ambiente criativo, o empregado pode voltar revigorado para a empresa e contribuir com novas ideias.Não é tão fácil para os empreendedores brasileiros encontrar investidores como no Vale do Silício e o custo da infraestrutura é alto. Mas as coisas estão melhorando. Os empreendedores brasileiros têm grandes ideias e estão tentando descobrir o que fazer a seguir. Rio de Janeiro e São Paulo, por exemplo, estão estabelecendo ótimos espaços de co-working que melhoram a colaboração e a criatividade.Trazendo a conversa para dentro da Evernote, podemos afirmar que manter a cultura, é, com certeza, uma prioridade. A mudança está na forma como ela será mantida, já que após 7 anos e 150 milhões de usuários no mundo, as tomadas de decisões sobem alguns níveis, junto com a maturidade. Nós continuamos trabalhando para realizar as coisas rapidamente. Nós trabalhamos em um ambiente aberto, colaborativo e que incentiva a criatividade. Nosso objetivo é continuar a crescer para uma grande corporação, mas mantendo a mentalidade de startup.Descubra o futuro da colaboração e do trabalho através de empreendedores brasileiros. #WorkSmarter

Today I will become the first recipient of the During my few years working with Late last year I left my role at Rockstart to With the introduction of the Dutch Startup Visa on January 1st 2015, Holland now appears a much more attractive option for non-European entrepreneurs to set up shop. This visa is intended to be a 12 month runway to the above mentioned Self-Employed Visa as it has Here is a list of what I included in my application:In addition to this, Rockstart had to submit:Feel free to ping me with questions if you are thinking about applying.UPDATE:Yesterday I spoke with the people at IND and RVO responsible for assessing and processing the startup visa applications. There told me that on average they expect applications to be processed in around 6–7 weeks. They claim this delay is because of the number of different people and departments involved in reviewing the applications. At the moment, these applications are posted between the respective reviewers and this is part of the reason it takes so long to review an application. IND are currently ‘experimenting’ with distributing Highly Skilled Migrant Visa applications amongst reviewers via email and are hoping to be able to do the same soon with the Startup Visa applications.

Let’s get this out of the way. I spent 8 turbulent years at my former Wall Street employer. A lifetime ago. I have nothing but fond memories of the friends with whom I worked and the work we did.A A startup accelerator, or its younger cousin, the incubator, is a several-month program that provides mentorship, training and investor introductions. It helps early stage companies with a life-support system of resources such as office space, technology, or production facilities.Also money.Some of the most successful and popular examples in the United States are Companies accepted to top accelerator/incubator programs are exposed to the business equivalent of movie stars and professional athletes.

Few companies have access to that breadth and depth of an investor pool.

The truth is this could easily be written about any large successful financial institution. In fact, as much as I wish I could take full credit for this idea, in researching this post, I These accelerators provide founders and their early-stage startups with mentorship through a vast internal and external network of industry and product leaders. They provide access to investors, either at demo-day or throughout the program. They provide infrastructure in the form of office space (sometimes inside the companies themselves), technology, production lines, design teams and many provide funding as well.What does the sponsoring company get? Besides the equity stake, of course, Coca-Cola, through it’s accelerator To date these accelerators have followed the traditional model of accepting applications from young outside companies. But after speaking with some former colleagues about this idea, a proposal was made:Taking Goldman Sachs as an example again, imagine an employee who comes up with an idea for a FinTech (financial technology) innovation. He or she could propose it to their superiors where the merits would be debated but likely decided it’s either too costly or too risky to implement. The idea could also stray too far from the core business model. Where does that leave the inquisitive young worker bee? They could try to fight the urge to run with the idea and continue in their current role or they resign and venture off on their own. Both outcomes leave the company at somewhat of a loss. Off the top of my head I personally know of several GS colleagues who did exactly that: the popular But if an incubator program was available to internal employees to flesh out these ideas it could provide an effective outlet for staff that would have otherwise left, keep innovation from walking out the door, and providing future managers the This is a thought experiment.

With iOS everything was fine in the design process but I stumbled a bit with android because I really hate it so bad at that time. Their design styles where too awful and most of the apps on it looked ancient After finishing One of the things that we learned is listening to the customers feedback and doing some tests based on that. Also we believe that My days at If you like the article please recommend it on Medium and share it ☺Product designer for living … 

It is no coincidence that the best entrepreneurs I have met over the past couple of years have been some of the most modest, humble, organised and driven people that I have met in my entire life. Entrepreneurs are natural rebels. They don’t like to conform; they like to So here we are. These are some of the hard lessons I have learnt over the past two years as Co-Founder and CEO of Why does the Marketing Team need to know about the different joysticks that your Product Team is testing? Why do the Developers need to know about the meetings that the Sales Team has coming up? The answer may seem obvious now, but you would be surprised how many (particularly small and medium-sized) teams don’t operate in this way. Keep the feedback loop internal as well as external. You never know how vital a piece of information like this may be for other members of your company, and it can avoid some serious problems later on.And the key to good knowledge looping: to encourage feedback from your colleagues. What are their opinions? Do they have any suggestions?If this is something that you struggle with, start by setting scheduled meetings to update each other on what you are working on. I find it best to print things off. Discuss what is being worked on. Help each other.“I’ve been in contact with John, and I hope to hear back from him this week. I’ve also been filling in such-and-such a database. Next week I’m going to start that draft we spoke about,” is NOT an update.“This is what I have done so far of that draft. What do you think? Also, I’m going to speak to John this afternoon about our upcoming release. This is what I planned to speak about… Is there anything you think it would be worth mentioning?”. Much better.For better-established companies, this might come across as micromanaging. For a startup, I believe that sharing knowledge and opinions is a good way to get everyone on the same page and working toward the same goal.If you are reading this you then will likely be well aware of the Lean Methodology spoken about in the popular book Your vision, your dream…that is Perfection in your eyes. Never lose sight of that (but be flexible enough for it to change). Take that Perfection and add your Resources, Priorities and (conservative!) Timeline to the equation.In case you need some help with the maths, the part in the brackets in the first equation comes to zero, meaning that Perfection = Everything I Want. The second equation is how to tackle your first product launch as a startup. I cannot stress this point enough…One final point, please make yourself proud. Don’t think of an MVP as a poor man’s version of what you This one may seem obvious, but it is amazing how quickly a small company can become blinkered and solely focused on one possible direction and method of execution. Did you know that your PR man was a fanatic gamer as a child, or that your CMO acted at the Edinburgh Film Festival? Sometimes we need to think outside the box about our team’s strengths and look for ways to utilise everyone’s skills.Whether you’re an expert in your field or you’ve recently graduated with an MBA from the London Business School, there will still be plenty of gaps in your knowledge, particularly when it comes to running a startup.So begin to network, attend seminars, apply for pitching events and accelerator programmes; do whatever you can to mingle with people who have It should be very high up on the your priority list to put together a small group of core mentors who will always be on hand to help out. These relationships may evolve into advisor roles, but there are plenty of experienced entrepreneurs and businesspeople out there who are happy Wibbu’s first period of change and expansion happened while we took part in the Ignite Accelerator Programme up in Newcastle, England. At the start of the programme, we would spend 2–4 hours every day meeting serial entrepreneurs, local businessmen, successful CEOs, charity workers, and almost anyone who was willing to give up their time to speak to us.For us, initially, we found this quite frustrating. We had a product to build with very little lead time, and the majority of these people had absolutely no connection to that product (a language learning app), our field (EdTech), or our market (the Spanish-speaking world).At times it felt like everyone was out to destroy our dreams, and to play devil’s advocate, but to push it to the point of us really questioning what the hell we were making. It was probably only with hindsight, however, that we realised the importance of these meetings.Developing a dating app? Of course, you will want to speak to the makers of Tinder, Happn, OkCupid… but what about other app developers, or games developers, or the founders of a shopping website? All of these people will bring a different perspective to what you are creating.With this, I bring you one of the most valuable lessons I have learnt on this journey:Is it your user retention numbers? Is it your team’s experience? Is it your vision? Whatever the answer, if you start to see positive feedback regarding a particular aspect of your company or product then start to exploit this as much as possible in meetings, pitches, presentations, advertising… Who knows, perhaps you have stumbled upon your USP.WARNING: This may not be something you first expected would excite people. I remember running a focus group with some English teachers in Mexico City recently. Expecting them to want features such as student analytics and content creation, I was very pleasantly surprised when they revealed that the “free play” aspect of the app is extremely important to them. This is now a benefit of the app that I continue to promote to teachers that I speak to.This may just be something you do informally at lunch or as a scheduled weekly event. Either way, it is extremely worthwhile. Why? Because sometimes it is far easier to analyse someone else’s product or company that your own.TRY THIS: Choose a product (it could be a competitor’s or one in a completely different industry). Play with that product and analyse it with scrutiny. Now answer these three questions.Not only will this get your analytical brain working, but it will open your eyes to potential problems in your own product, and allow you to think of solutions.And Test again. I am happy to hold up my hand here and admit that this is where we went wrong at the beginning. We spend two weeks running focus groups to test the usability and effectiveness of our first MVP, but did nothing else for the following 12 months! We spoke to users over Skype and by email, but this is not enough.Get the product into the hands of your users and watch them! It’s that simple. There’s no need even to create fancy questionnaires or surveys. Just watch and discuss. You will learn more than you could ever imagine, and you’ll be amazed about what your users respond to when they play with your product. CEO of Wibbu. We make video-game mobile apps to learn languages.

Are you the person who wakes up eager to get to your desk to whittle that email back to inbox zero and feel a sense of accomplishment? Or check your social notifications to make sure you aren’t missing out on anything important? If you said yes, you aren’t alone. Self-interruptions account forIt’s a lie!And it has a name. It’s been highlighted as the The most productive (and successful) people are those that limit daily distractions to focus on their one thing. They ask themselves: The problem is that most people fail to understand what it is that they should be focusing their time on and end up doing everything, and everything poorly. Hear me out — here are six ways the false hustle could be holding you back, fellow entrepreneur — and, more importantly, what to do to stop it.Persistent email checking is one of the main distractions in business today. It falls on the shoulders of poor context switching; going from having a deep focus on one task to jumping into another without giving yourself the necessary time to decompress from the previous. It’s a productivity killer. And so are your frequent team check ins, web browsing, aimless conversations with co-workers, and checking the weather to see if your tee time is justified. In the end, you can’t control the weather, but you can control your focus.Don’t fall victim to the busyness disease. Plan your day the night before. Prioritize the one thing you need to accomplish tomorrow, today by eliminating all activities that take you away from completing it. Delegate unnecessary tasks, cancel disruptive meetings, turn off all notifications, and hone in on your main goal.The lead developer as co-founder, the overextended mompreneur, the CEO and janitor, the President as the shoulder-to-cry-on — most of us wear many hats, and need to in the early days of running a business. But the reality is that 70% (or more) of the things that keep us occupied are either unnecessary, or should be delegated to someone else. Think of it this way: if you typically bill out $180/hour, then the things you should be working on need to have Here’s the reality: you can’t be everything to everyone. Feature-rich startups end up running circles around themselves trying to keep up to the demand of fixing bugs and losing focus. Clients that feel the need to offload everything to you because they ‘pay you a lot of money and need to justify their spend’ (also called SOW creep), end up keeping you busy for the sake of, well, keeping you busy. In the end, you produce crap work because you are trying to please everyone.Are you saying one thing, but then doing something else? If so, you’re a perpetrator to executive misalignment. It occurs when employees don’t understand the company’s overall goals and is worsened when founders make decisions that conflict with them. Many new or lower level employees often only have a vague idea of how their role is tied to the goals of the company and therefore become isolated from the team. If not corrected, “isolated groups — especially in big companies — will continually create their own justifications for their actions that may be totally removed from the purpose of the business,” explains A clear direction will help you and your team stay on track. Internally, your team needs to understand your business goals and mission. (If you care to share your revenue projections, then by all means, let your team know.) Externally, your customers need to know your purpose/why and what they can expect working with you. Post the goals in the company wiki, on a physical bulletin board, heck — at the water cooler — and discuss them daily. When you and your team know what you are working towards, it makes you hustle with more swagger.Steve Jobs said “I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.” This means saying no to anything that is not in line with your goals even if it means saying no to a high-paying client. Quick wins, fast sprints, and revenue-generating ideas that steer you off course will sink your ship.Many service-based businesses know this all too well. Here’s a common scenario: cash flow is tight this month, but a low paying prospect wants to work with you. You’re lured by the cash, but not energized by the work. You say yes, to find out that they take up more time than expected and the only time you have to properly position yourself to take on bigger clients. It’s a catch 22. But by saying no, you would have opened up to the possibility of attracting the right client, because you would have had the focused time to do so.Jumping from task to task without a little break to rest your thoughts is a killer. Justine Musk once said ‘reading is the inhale, writing is the exhale.’ Many great writers never pair research and writing in the same productivity interval. They need time to think about how all the new information will best be articulated. The same goes for pretty much any task. Successful people often schedule their days in two chunks: 1) a highly focused thinking chunk, and 2) an everything else chunk. A typical day to me is a morning of high brain power work (like writing this blog post) and an afternoon of sales calls. This allows me to switch contexts from thinking hat to sales hat without having to flip flop on a moment’s notice.Growth is great. It’s amazing. If it’s at the right pace. Hiring too soon means you can kill your cashflow. Hiring too late means you end up doing all the work yourself and likely a crappy job at it. You may be proud of the apparent hustle you have in doing all the work, but it will crush you.Hiring is one of those often overlooked and never streamlined processes many business owners face. I know this all too well. In the last three years, we have seen eight people come and go from one position. We failed at a couple things (sharing the vision of the company, training, and support) and hired too fast for a role we didn’t need.Some companies want to scale up so quickly they end up putting the cart before the horse, hiring too many employees while not having the revenues to support the plan. Hoping that additional manpower will contribute to increased sales is poor practice and will lead to an untimely business death. Hire not only when you can afford it, but when you need it. Just because you have the cash flow to justify adding to the team, doesn’t mean it’s the best decision. In many cases, outsourcing work to contractors will be more beneficial.If you’re a hustler with swagger and closing deals every day, then you got game my friend. But if you feel like you’re getting sucked into the vortex that is the false hustle, then it’s time to recognize it. Stop pretending to be someone (or a company) that has real hustle. Real hustle takes courage, tenacity and commitment, even if it means having to give the shirt off your back during a Boston snowstorm. Know your limits, but also know when you need to go past the tipping point. Real hustlers don’t claim to be ‘busy’ — real hustlers plan, analyze and do better at making every move a move toward their goals. Every moment, every day.Originally posted on Geek in stilettos.

I’m concerned.The degree of schadenfreude in the Indian startup ecosystem is a little more than mildly disturbing. People who haven’t achieved half of what Deepinder or Harshvardhan have, commenting on how they were sure that Zomato or TinyOwl were bound to stumble in the hyper-growth game, I have a simple question for you: if you are so fucking smart in predicting successes, why not join a VC firm and ensure good returns for the LPs?I’m no hotshot startup founder who has built a boatload of unicorns, but from the little I have read and from the little I have experienced , it’s obvious that The commentators harp a lot on strategic points like what the focus should be on — which mostly tends to be unit economics. Alright genius, that’s what all businesses should ultimately focus on, but it’s his fucking company, let him run it his fucking way. Can we please, pretty please just focus on building our startups most of which don’t have a product with even a tenth of the traction the supposedly ‘doomed’ startups have?Not surprisingly, most of the hatred stems from the fact that these guys have raised a ton of money, whereas most of the complainants haven’t. I find it ridiculous — yes, investors look at traction, and yes, the pedigree colleges (IITs, BITS, NITs, etc.) are at an advantage. They have tightly knit, tech savvy college communities they can fall back on to get the initial traction. But then, welcome to life, it isn’t fair.As startup founders, let’s play the game as well as we can, and let’s not root for someone to lose, please.Peace out.Founder. Thinker. Talker. Dreamer. Doer.

Working regularly with startups I see that the shadow of failure is always in close pursuit. That’s why Tim Harford’s book While you may find it obvious how complexity could be a problem it might be worth elaborating on how Startups are risky and prone to catastrophic failure. Why is this? Because of they become complex and involve “tightly linked” activities. Bare with me…At the Working on a startup in the 21st century generally involves the close coordination of business, design and technology activities. Each of these areas have their own unique challenges but are also And so hear are my four suggestions on how to avoid the catastrophic failure of your startup.We’re all guilty of thinking “wouldn’t it be good if my solution also included this feature too?” Many entrepreneurs can’t avoid stuffing their software/product/service with more features because they believe more features means more value. In fact more features means more complexity which means a higher risk of failure.So why does this happen?The entrepreneur resorts to feature stuffing because they’re not sure what their customers really need. If they really knew what problems they were solving and for whom they were solving them then they’d have a much better chance of reducing scope and complexity.The other thing to think about when talking complexity is that simple ideas will ultimately get more complex. Think of some of the biggest Internet businesses out there at the moment:A simple idea of renting out a spare room has led to complex technical challenges like building an “insta-booking” app and operating in What could be more simple than an auction? You post an item and get people to bid for it. However, on top of the the technical challenges you’ve also got issues of trust, payments, refunds, ratings etc… A whole lot of complexity under the bonnet.Larry and Sergei’s idea was so simple that users quickly saw the value of Google and in 2014 racked up All of the above ideas started simple but led to greater and greater complexity. Imagine if they started off with complex ideas?Given that your idea WILL increase in complexity over time you need to make sure you don’t hit the “null motivation horizon” before your business starts to get some traction. I’ve had first hand experience of this when building software products. The client resorts to feature stuffing because they aren’t confident in the strength of their original idea. In an effort to please multiple requests from different stakeholders new features are added and the product soon becomes overly complex with many interconnected (Product complexity grows exponentially with time if you’re not careful and it won’t take long before you hit the “null motivation horizon”. Once this threshold is crossed motivation quite literally drops off a cliff leading to complacency, errors and catastrophic failure.Key to avoiding complexity is being able to confidently say no. This only comes from having a clear sense of priorities.When everything is equally important then we’re easily distracted. We have no way to focus on doing any one thing well and so we end up doing many things badly.You can gain focus by defining the core ideas underpinning your startup. You need to prioritise the things you want to tackle and identify which ones are the most important. Picture listing out all the different elements of your idea within a set of concentric circles. The centre circle (the smallest one) should contain the key core elements that are essential to the existence of your startup. Everything else either supports these core elements (and are nice to have) or are superfluous (so drop them like a bad habit).Once you’re able to identify the core of your startup you’re in a much better position to say no to any distracting new features that could create unnecessary complexity.Avoid thinking about your startup as one singular entity but something comprised of lots of different modules. I like to use Lego as an analogy. You should be able to break down your startup into its constituent building blocks and so simplify what initially might look quite intricate. You then want to see how you can isolate each of these building blocks and test them separately. This is the whole premise of the Lean Startup. Identifying your fundamental assumptions and validating them before ploughing ahead too quickly. What you’ve done is “When dealing with a SAAS product this involves playing with business model canvases; doing customer development; performing usability testing; and lots of prototyping.So if you’re thinking of launching your startup soon please remember:Co–founder of Spook Studio  The Happy Startup School.

You may have read about the transition from Here’s what I learned from making the move.In the agency world, I was a pro. I’d mastered every step of the process.First, we’d set a crazy, but not too crazy, project timeline. We’d meet clients at kick-off meetings and stay in touch with status calls. Then we’d go heads-down and try to build what we’d discussed.A lot of great things that can emerge from that. Every new project offers up a blank canvas, just waiting for you to create something great. Whether you do that or make a “camel” depends on how well everyone works together.After over a year on a single agency project, I started to develop a strong attachment to it. I cared about more than just building something I could put my name next to. I started caring about how much traffic it got and how many new users signed up. I cared about how those users were engaging and interacting with the product. I was getting the bug to be constantly building, measuring, and making something better.Turns out, this is the perfect attitude to take with you to a startup.I was getting the bug to be constantly building, measuring, and making something better.On my first day at When I pointed out the obvious, I got the perfect response from our cofounder, who was showing me around:“Startups, man.”It’s no surprise that a team building a product from scratch is going to be full of resourceful people. People who know how to multitask. Working on UI features and improvements, we’re working on a bunch of projects at once. When you’re building something new, there’s a seemingly endless product road map. And when you get helpful customer feedback or uncover an annoying bug, you have to be prepared to react. The sheer number of new tools and techniques I’ve come across and learned in the last 3 months is a little dizzying. That’s not too surprising, because it can take some of the latest and coolest technology to solve complex problems. Some things stick immediately, others you’ll learn over time. Some haven’t sunk in yet and of course, I’m still learning.All the libraries, frameworks, and plugins you come across keep you busy. On top of that, we use a lot of tools for debugging, caching, tracking, analytics, A/B testing, feedback and usability. You’re always looking for an opportunity to watch, measure, and improve. Communicating your strengths and weaknesses and filling gaps where you can becomes incredibly valuable.I’ve found that learning by doing is the best way to get familiar with all these new tools. If you want to use a technology just to use it, chances are you’re only going to skim the surface. But if you’re learning in the context of building something, the pieces start to fall into place a lot faster. The other important thing is to pair up with people who are a lot smarter than you and can show you a thing or two.If you’re learning in the context of building something, the pieces start to fall into place a lot faster.There’s always a lot to do at startups. Balancing late-night work with spending time with the team outside work becomes vital. You’ll create something every day, get it out into the wild to get feedback, and make it better — constantly. You’ll switch from giving input and making recommendations to another team to taking ownership of a product at a moment’s notice.I’m very much a startup newbie — only a few months in, tackling new technologies and problems. At the end of the day, relying on previous experience to take new challenges head-on will get you most of the way there.

I’ve been following the We need to put the situation in the context of startup life and what its like to be a founder.When putting all of the above in context, what happened with Zirtual is a series of events that happens all the time at startups. Zirtual’s headcount made it larger and more public than others, but it’s not an outlier. The one area where I feel the critics have been most unfair is calling Donovan a bad/unethical/immoral person. Despite all of her failures — which, remember, are all common in startups — I just don’t think she is a bad person. She tried. She made mistakes. She failed. People were hurt. But she didn’t want that to happen and had no ill intent.Zirtual is not a case of first degree murder, it was an accidental killing.Exploring the next path. Formerly 

However,The million-dollar question, or rather the billion-dollar question for some of these new companies, is simple: what do venture capital firms look for?Stephan says that from the perspective of a VC firm, there are some You need a smart, put-together team. A small business is only as good as its founders and employees, and there are some pretty clear signs that your team or business may not meet their required standards:A team lacking relevant experience with no background in the industry they’re trying to be successful in.Co-founders who don’t want to commit and work full-time.Founders who cannot distinctly identify their role in the business.Simply put, successful startups are built by high impact teams. Your team dynamic is impossible to fake in a pitch. That being said, your true colours will show when presenting and therefore so too will your team dynamic. A lack of commitment to the product and the team is an easy way to spot a that a company isn’t ready for higher levels of investment.You’re not required to be a coding genius as the CEO of a tech startup. However, the technical portion of your company is crucial from the perspective of a VC, says the investor. Dangerous signs from a company which is lacking technical foundation include:Lack of a co-founder with technical background.No ownership of IP for the software or technology behind the business.Outsourcing all of the technical product development in the early days.Though there are plenty of quick and accessible methods of outsourcing work, successful companies need to know how they got to the product that they’re trying to sell. This does not just apply to technical work: outsourcing pitch deck production and investor outreach to bankers and advisers can equally be frowned upon by early stage investors.VC firms are constantly investigating a company, including past events and developments that the company and its founders have gone through. If you’ve got skeletons in the closet, VC firms will most likely find out whether you address them openly or not:A co-founder who has “mysteriously” left the company.Previous investors who have decided to no longer support you after their initial investment.CEO’s who cannot appropriately answer all basic questions about key aspects of their business during a pitch meeting.Don’t make it a secret, says Stephan. Addressing the past, even if it is potentially negative is important in order to be transparent. Acknowledging former mistakes and using them as information to inform how you move forwards is key to showing your commitment to a business that has learned and grown from its previous shortcomings.Forewarned is forearmed. Knowing what a VC firm looks for in a company can make the difference between success and failure in fundraising. Being sure that you don’t exhibit any of the characteristics mentioned will increase your likelihood of securing investment.Deputy Editor for The Startup Magazine, A collection of articles from The Startup Magazine and, writers we like on Medium.

I’m a big fan of podcasts, it’s engaging in a way paper isn’t, it’s got that human touch and feel that makes it sticky. Moreover, I’ve never had/made the time for a newspaper in the morning, and after a long day at work, active content consumption is usually the last thing I feel like. Movies, tv and music has always been my go to for passive content, but now my favourite is more and more turning to podcasts. The idea of radio on demand may not sound very innovative, but it has some big advantages over alternative media. Namely, the ability to do this while performing monotonous tasks, such as commuting, highway driving, working out etc.Personally, I’ve changed my morning routine to include a 45–60 minute workout of some sort everyday (almost), in which time, I also listen to the BBC Global News (30 mins, recorded late the night before) and at least one episode of some of the podcasts listed below. This allows me to keep up on the (biggest) world news, and on topics that I have a passion for, while maintaining my physical health. I love it!So, here they are, in no particular order:This list is by no means exclusive, but I prefer a shorter list that’s more digestible. That said, I’m always on the hunt for new podcasts, so if I’ve missed anything in this space, please do let me know — Startup Business Ninja - Ops, BI, Tech - Languages, RunningWe are a global tribe creating the startup community we’ve always wanted.

Remember Aaliyah? She was a double-platinum, American RB singer. Before a terrible plane crash took her life, Aaliyah had sold 52 million records worldwide, earning her the nicknames ‘Princess of RB’ and ‘Queen of Urban Pop’.”Like many first-time startup founders, I f*** up all the time, at least daily. I try not to, but, truthfully, every day brings a new challenge that I’d never previously prepared myself for. They just don’t teach you this stuff in school.Legal. Accounting. Payroll. Fundraising. UI / UX Design. Sales. Social Media Marketing. Product Management… so many things to think about.Just two years after graduation, I audaciously (and impulsively) left my job at Google to pursue my startup dream. Filled with the naivete and exuberance of youth, there was no way my Tinder for Jobs app would fail.I’d read the recommended startup literature. Then, I would be ready to take off and join the rest of the Unicorns.Easy enough.Fast-forward 12 months. We didn’t have product-market fit. We didn’t hook our users. And we definitely didn’t have traction. I’ve previously written a post titled Instead, I’ll tell you how we scrapped our way out of the deep, deep abyss of self-loathing and “failure”, and “pivoted” to You’ve probably heard of heroic tales of how startup founders altered the course of their business model, earning them the status of most admired CEOs. Zuckerberg’s Wirehog became Facebook, not bad. YouTube even started out as video dating site.Rarely, however, does one talk about how painful this transition can be.To give you a bit of an idea, ask your coworkers — “Where do you want to go for lunch today?”Now imagine trying to get five people to agree on major changes that directly affect your team’s ability to succeed and pay the bills.Chances are what worked (or what you thought worked…) in the past may not be right for your “pivoted” company. In our case, we built an amazing team of iOS developers and business-people, who were passionate about making Tinder for Jobs awesome.With its euthanasia, our company needed to click refresh and even, at times, control + alt + delete. We were looking to iterate quickly and test new ideas, hardly optimal for developing on iOS or keeping a sales team.My co-founder Reilly and I are the only two left from our original team. We had built amazing bonds and friendships with everyone. But, we were bloated, and we knew it. They knew it. For nearly two months, the full team struggled together in search of a new beginning. We shouldn’t have all endured the torture. We should have pulled the band-aid off immediately and lessened the pain.Take swift action and make the necessary HR decisions to let go of those you no longer need and can no longer put in a position to excel.You wouldn’t believe how many critical product-market fit mistakes could be avoided if you go out and actually talk to people.So for weeks, I threw on a backwards college hat. I even shaved! After all, in the words of my mentor Aaliyah:With $5 Starbucks gift cards to give out, I approached and interviewed student after student.I learned a lot. It turns out… I’m actually pretty old. The anonymous gossip website JuicyCampus was no longer. YikYak had become all the rage. Wharton students no longer wanted to work at Goldman Sachs; they wanted to be Googlers.It’s like the world had turned upside down on college campuses (our target demographic), and I had no idea because I’d spent too much time wire-framing, product strategizing, and forgetting the most important thing — to be solving a real problem!Just don’t approach people with this line:You’ll get some weird looks, get ignored, and feel like an idiot.Dust yourself off. And try again. You have nothing to lose.Your company actually depends on your ability to do so. Rejection will help you refine your craft. Asking your friends for advice and feedback can be helpful, but it also can be detrimental as friends can think too much like you or simply be “too nice.”Rather than spending days or weeks considering or designing the perfect feature, put something out there and just see what happens.For example, our team loves HBO’s show Silicon Valley. It’s kind of our lives, so we decided why not host the Official SV Tour — an all-expenses paid tour of SV. We’d show two students around Hooli’s campus (ie Google), Pied Piper (ie our Trailer Park HQ) and more.From idea conception to execution, we launched this page and raffle content in 3 hours.

So what happened? In February of last year, I was still feeling pretty good about grad school. I had an exciting project that had the potential to reveal a lot about a brain disease called The big day came, and my obsessive over-preparation for quals paid off. I presented my research plan, handled every question to the satisfaction of my committee members, and got some really helpful feedback. I felt motivated and ready to DO SOME SCIENCE.As soon as I passed my quals, the tiny, nagging voice in my head that kept asking whether I The truth is, I had doubts about my choice to go to grad school within a few months of starting the PhD program. In my first 3 years I went through several bouts of crises in which I seriously questioned continuing grad school, but I kept convincing myself to stay because it would be “good for my career.” This time was different. I had reached a critical point: it was either commit to doing this project for the next 3+ years, or cut my losses and find something else to do.Despite this conviction, I was still really scared to actually leave the path that I’d been on for so long. My days looked something like this:After a couple months of absolute misery, I decided (with the help of some very supportive friends and family) to take a leave of absence from grad school and look for an internship or job. Being in the Bay Area, I naturally started looking at startups. I decided that startups were the way to go, namely because (a) I liked the idea of a fast-paced, high-energy work environment focused on actually doing/making things, and (b) startups generally seemed more okay with hiring people who were smart, but might not have much relevant job experience (or in my case, As these things go, I ended up getting connected with a startup called Amplitude provides scalable analytics for mobile and web apps. In other words, it has absolutely nothing to do with anything I’ve learned or worked on. However, the company was looking for someone to start out taking care of day-to-day operations, finance, HR, etc, while also learning the product and company. This person would then move on to a more focused role depending on what they found interesting/were good at. In other words, it sounded perfect. It would give me the chance to learn a ton of new things as part of a small team at a fast-growing startup, and I would have the flexibility of figuring out what area I wanted to work in. I joined Amplitude 2 weeks later and haven’t looked back since.Now that I’ve been here for 7 months, I’ve had time to realize that despite the obvious differences between academia and startups, there’s actually quite a lot that my time in academia taught me that translates to my current work.This post contains observations that I’ve made over the past year — a year in which I went from feeling miserable and trapped to being at a job that I actually enjoy. Hopefully, it will give anyone who’s currently feeling stuck in academia (or anywhere else for that matter) assurance that, So here it is — things I’ve learned from academia that have helped me at a tech startup:I’m now working full-time as Amplitude’s marketing team of one. Everyone else at Amplitude has about as much marketing experience as I did coming in, which is to say, very little. I’ve been teaching myself and figuring things out as I go, reading lots of blog posts, and seeking out advice from more experienced marketers in my space.Luckily, all of this was incredibly familiar.In grad school, this happened when I wanted to use human stem cells and turn them into a specific type of brain cell (called microglia) that I wanted to study. My lab didn’t have any expertise in this area, so I caught myself up by reading dozens of journal articles, getting coffee with students and postdocs from other labs who did have experience, and practicing the techniques to make sure I got them right.My time in research got me really comfortable with a few things: embarking on a new project with very little prior knowledge, confidence that I could figure things out given the available resources, and asking more experienced people for help. So, when I started working on marketing, I was naturally a little nervous, but I knew exactly how to jump right in.If there’s one guaranteed thing in research, it’s that your experiments will fail. Most of the time it’s for no discernible reason, no matter how many things you try to fix to get it to work.I spent a whole summer in college trying to make biodegradable microspheres that would deliver drugs to injury sites to improve healing. It never worked. Turns out the process of making the microspheres was too harsh for the protein I was working with, so I was degrading the protein every time, leaving me with some empty, useless microspheres. So that was fun.As a result, researchers develop a pretty thick skin — which is perfect for working in the world of startups, where failure is common and often praised.In addition, you learn when to call it quits. Obviously you don’t give up right away, but after you’ve banged your head against the wall enough times…you know when it’s time to move on and find a different approach.At my current company, we all work a lot, but we’re working as a team, building a product that our customers need and get a lot of value out of. We feel ownership for our work. We really, really want to see it succeed, because it’s something that we’ve built and care about.Contrast this with grad school. I felt pressure to always be working — but it wasn’t a good, self-motivated pressure. It made me stressed out and miserable. Looking back, the difference is that I didn’t really believe in what I was doing. I didn’t actually care if my project succeeded or not, except for how it would affect me completing my degree. I just worked all the time (or felt guilty when I wasn’t working) because I thought I was It’s not about work-life balance, so much as finding the work that you actually want to do, and hopefully, a team to do it with. Also, a good work environment certainly doesn’t hurt:Sure, startups are risky, but so is pursuing a research project that has very little chance of producing results. The really exciting, potentially groundbreaking research ideas are always the ones with the lowest chances of working out.Working in a lab environment for 7 years trained me to be comfortable with some amount of risk. It also taught me to always have several projects going in parallel: at least one really exciting, high-risk, high-payoff project, and a couple safer projects on the side.This one’s pretty obvious: as a scientist, hypotheses and experiments are your bread and butter. The good news is that if you end up leaving science, these skills are still incredibly applicable.Coming up with a new product idea or marketing campaign is all about starting with an initial hypothesis. Now that I’m working on marketing, that hypothesis might be that a certain blog post, ad, or campaign is going to increase traffic to our website and generate potential customers. I may have certain hypotheses about the messaging, medium, design, etc. that I can test — and then I evaluate the data from Google Analytics and our own internal tracking to see what’s working and what isn’t. Sound familiar, scientists?In both academia and early startups, funding is essential. At least some startups, including Amplitude, have revenue, but in an academic lab, you are completely dependent on raising money from government agencies, research foundations, and private charities.The letters are a little different: instead of NRSA, NSF, and K grants, you’re thinking about seed rounds and Series A’s, but the underlying goals and strategies are the same.How do you convey, in a very short amount of space (in the case of research grant proposals) or time (in the case of investor pitches), that your idea is worth investing in, and that you have the ability and resources to carry out that idea? If you’ve written research grants, you’re already a pro at this.Except now I don’t have to worry about splashing hydrochloric acid on my shirt or having my clothes smell like the mouse room.There you have it. If you’re reading this and you want to leave academia, I feel you. I hope reading this gives you some assurance that a life in research has taught you many things that are valuable for life after research. Most of all, I hope this helps you if you know, deep down, that you need to leave, but haven’t, whether it’s due to fear, inertia, or a combination of the two.I realize that I’m incredibly lucky to have landed what is turning out to be an amazing job so soon after deciding to leave my PhD program. I also didn’t talk much about just how hard of a decision it was to leave (which could be a whole other post).I don’t intend to leave biomedical science behind forever, even though I’ve stepped away from it for the time being. I envision that my next step will be to work at a startup doing something innovative in the health space. I don’t know what exactly, but whatever it is, it will be making something that really improves the quality of people’s lives; that’s the reason I wanted to go into biomedical research in the first place.For now, I’m happy where I am. I’m learning new things every day and flexing a part of my brain I haven’t in a while. I have a lot of say over what projects I work on. I get to spend time with fun, smart people every day, working on something that our users get a ton of value out of. Bottom line: I left a path I’d been on for 7 years, and it turned out more than okay.Lapsed neuroscientist-in-training, now doing startup marketing at 

Even though it’s trendy in startups to say that ideas mean nothing and execution means everything, the reality is much less binary and much more nuanced. For example, even the world’s best entrepreneur with incredible execution will fail if their idea is fundamentally flawed, or if their market is too small. This list of 10 rules put together by the What we have found is that if an early-stage founder can check off the ten items below, they have a solid foundation by which to start a company. You are absolutely not assured success if you can check off these items (nor are you assured failure if you can’t), but your chances of success are much, much higher if you can.In order to power through the hard times of being an entrepreneur, founders need to be working on ideas that they can see themselves still working on in 5, 10, or even 20 years. As Elon Musk famously said, “Being an entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of death.” If you don’t have the requisite passion, your chances of seeing a project through are minimal.Other people will easily be able to see through your lack of passion, like customers, investors, and press. For example, investors are typically concerned more about the “why you”, then they are about the “why” of your idea.Big ideas are raised, not born, and they are most often raised by simple pain points. For example, Mark Zuckerberg didn’t wake up one morning and say, “I’m am going to create the social graph.” Instead, he set out to build a simple utility for Harvard students to see who was in their classes.All the great businesses of our time have started with an incredibly simple idea, and then expanded upon that. If you can start by solving one problem, with one product, for one customer, you will be sufficiently focused and can have a great foundation for success.Also, it’s a common misconception that companies who focused on early user growth (ex. Google) didn’t have a revenue model in mind when they started. In reality, these businesses saw incredible early traction, and then the founders made a tactical decision to shift their focus to growth.Can someone build a great company with a zero revenue mentality from the outset? Sure. But building a business with no revenue stream in the hopes of becoming the next Instagram is like buying a lottery ticket — except that lottery ticket costs a lot more time and effort than $3.This is a very important step during the ideation process: what are the things that need to happen before you make a dollar? If you have to provide a service in order to collect data that will then be sold to advertisers, for example, you have a very complex business. That would be 5+ steps to revenue. Try to limit the number of steps to revenue to around three from the beginning.A common mistake we encounter is that people don’t go nearly deep enough in their customer definition, or customer development. For example, many people will stop at “I am helping large companies hire.” In reality, they need to be able to say something like; “I am helping senior hiring managers at enterprise software companies in the United States with 400–800 employees. They are typically female, age 29–34, making an average of $58,000 per year. They report to the company HR lead, and their KPIs are X, Y, and Z, measured quarterly. They spend the majority of their day doing A, B, and C, and the biggest impediments to them hitting their KPIs include X, Y, and Z. Currently they are using products from companies A, B, and C, but those products don’t allow them to do these three critical things…”Also, there’s nobody you know more intimately than yourself. That is why so many great businesses have been formed from personal need.If you are not an expert on your market, then it’s time to get to work. There are no shortcuts here.Any market with less than 10 million people or multiple billions in annual revenue that is not growing at a very fast rate will be very hard to address, and is probably not worth your time. For example, even if you were lucky enough to be moderately successful in a $500 million market, you would likely still only have around a $50 million business.You will die winning a small market, so be smart and don’t start your company in a graveyard.Also, your secret sauce needs to be original. If it’s obvious, that is almost always a bad sign. The best ideas have a secret sauce that is transformational, not incremental.What secret do you know that will help you win? For example, Tony Hsieh started Zappos with a very distinct insight and secret sauce — customer service. His transformational insight was that buying shoes online was really a customer service problem, and not a retail problem.Your job in the idea stage is to find the things that make your idea bad. Try to kill your idea, and then, one-by-one, iterate and eliminate the negative aspects of the idea. The result will be a much more defensible foundation by which to start.You need to be pitching your idea all day long to anybody who will listen, and incorporating all the feedback you receive into improving the idea. Feedback is an entrepreneur’s best friend, and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs understand this better than anybody else. For example, on any given night, you can find 20 different events in Silicon Valley where people are openly sharing their ideas, and it is this collaborative, teamwork-oriented culture that leads to innovation.Director of the Founder Institute It Takes Time To Become Legendary… The Clock Is Ticking!

Last month I completed a year as a UX designer at With high hopes from the blissful unknown of a startups journey I started my journey as a designer, and a year later here I am a little wiser than I was a year ago.I learnt a few things over the year which have helped me become a better designer than I was a year ago. Without any further ado here they are:You may be familiar to the quote by Picasso,Understanding the difference in between copying and stealing was possibly one of my first revelations to becoming a better designer. As the workload in startup kept piling it was sometimes unavoidable to copy a sliver of someone elses imagination to get things done.But simply copying someone elses solution will not necessarily solve the problem in hand. The solution was devised for a particular problem the designer was facing. If the idea is copied without understanding its crux, it is as good as killing a good design. But on the other hand if the design is understood, analysed and then stolen with the appropriate changes it can add much more value than the sum of parts.The two basic building blocks of a modern day product development. It is no secret that both disciplines have a discourse with each others methods.The role of a modern day designer has evolved to be more holistic. The designer is expected to understand technology and Engineers design. Nurturing a good dialogue in between design and technology is the way to go.We at An open dialogue between designers and engineers saves time and fosters a good work culture.Presenting a design to colleagues in form images or interactions is not enough. The audience is a mixture of stakeholders, most of whom do not understand design the same way you do. Most of the time they don’t know what is the problem you are trying to solve.Giving the design a personality and rationality while selling is helpful in convincing the stakeholders with design solutions. Telling them about the specific such as;helps them understand your design better. Walking them through your design process and the rationality behind the designs makes it easy for them to connect to your designs and give better feedback.You can hit me up on twitter at Check out some other design projects:UX Designer Reviews, journeys and analysis about using Indian websites, apps and services.

By Quick test: How much do you know about your city’s startup community? Do you know who your most successful startups are? Do you know where in the city they’re based? Do you know the companies’ histories and where they’re trying to go in the future?Some of you may know this information pretty well; others, barely at all. If you’re among the latter, you may find that learning more about startups in your city isn’t always easy. Often, we don’t hear about our most innovative homegrown businesses until they’ve already morphed into major companies.Yet, if the Digital Revolution is all about providing easier access to information, the startup community — the leaders of this revolution — should set the example by finding an easy way for outsiders to learn more about who its members are and the solutions they’re building.1776 and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation’s In recent years, some startup communities have embraced mapping as a way to create a centralized database with information for outsiders to access. Two good examples include We picked two cities from the Innovation that Matters report — New York and Austin — and used the On a basic level, these maps show us where to find clusters of startup activity. As one might expect, startups in Austin tend to cluster in the downtown area, while those in New York City cluster in midtown Manhattan. Few appear in Brooklyn, a surprise given the borough’s reputation as a hipster tech hub.But more importantly, the maps shows us just how much activity is going on; small, aspiring companies with big dreams to change the world pop up all over both cities. This isn’t limited to tech hubs like Austin and New York: Similar mapping exercises in other cities would reveal the extent to which civic entrepreneurship is spreading all over the globe.Our overarching conclusion from Innovation that Matters is that the secret sauce of building civic startup clusters is to create network connectivity. Cities can do that by connecting the dots between entrepreneurs, public institutions, investors, established businesses, government, research institutions, and other actors in the ecosystem, in order to to foster an open, collaborative community in which people can freely exchange ideas and work together to develop new solutions to existing problems.In order to do this, however, these actors need to know what the ecosystem currently looks like — who is working on what, how far along they are in their work, what their motivations are, and what opportunities exist for collaboration. Mapping the network to understand these dynamics is a first basic step in the process of building an effective community.Our maps above are pretty basic; they just show a collection of locations of civic sector startups in each city. Yet, there are many ways to build on these maps to turn them into useful tools. Imagine layering on more detailed information about each company: what it’s building, who’s on the team, what stage of growth they are at, what needs they have, etc. Then, we could add information about other ecosystem actors. In education, for example, you could show the major ed tech investors, innovation leads in schools and universities, education research institutions, nonprofit advocacy groups, education corporations and others. There are many ways to build out mapping tools, but the basic concept is to increase the community’s awareness of itself and to help people connect with each other and exchange information more easily.Mapping by itself isn’t sufficient; it’s up to the community to take the information and use it for practical purposes, such as convening sessions and action-oriented programs. However, it is a useful first step that more and more communities are embracing as a way to drive local innovation to improve the lives of local citizens.Global incubator  seed fund helping startups transform industries that impact millions — education, energy  sustainability, health, transportation  cities.A 1776 Publication

It is impossible to live and work abroad without coming home a slightly different person. I’ve spent most of my life living and working outside of my home country (the United States), so I’ve had a lot of time to observe this phenomenon. In Switzerland, in Taiwan, and most recently in Estonia at the headquarters of Working in a new country involves a whole lot of change. You’re immersed in a fascinating different culture, surrounded by delicious new flavors to sample, and beckoned by a thrillingly unexplored city waiting to be discovered. But it doesn’t stop there. These outer changes are matched by less obvious yet equally dramatic inner changes — changes that can set you up for the wild, exhilarating ride of a startup career.What I’ve realized is this: Launching a startup involves building a new product, finding a new market, or creating a new business model — or all of these at once. A startup can’t hide behind comfortable routines or successes of the past because it doesn’t have any yet. You too, when you take on a job in a new country, will be starting afresh. The cultural scripts that have guided your daily life and interactions at work will no longer apply. Accolades you have earned in your home country will seem very far away. This may sound daunting, but ultimately it is exhilarating! It sets you up splendidly to question the obvious, and it frees you to dream up new ideas, plans and strategies. When I worked at the American Institute in Taiwan one summer, all of my officemates were middle aged Taiwanese women. They were extremely kind and loved helping me with my Mandarin homework. Every day at noon, my coworkers would begin to anxiously peer over at me, tell me I was working too hard, and insist that I go enjoy my lunch. It took me almost a month to figure out why. Apparently every day at lunch time my coworkers would quickly eat at their desks, then put a “It was a genius idea, and one that they never would have explained to me outright — I had to figure it out for myself (with some outside help, I’ll admit). Working abroad, you won’t necessarily be faced with bigger mountains to climb, metaphorically speaking. Rather,At first you may be frustrated that seemingly simple tasks now require supreme amounts of energy and cognition. But gradually, you will begin to notice a difference. And when you return to your home country, this difference may be staggering. Like an Olympic runner who trains at high altitudes in thin air to gain a powerful advantage back at sea level, after working abroad you will become a power problem-solver who can breeze through the tricky challenges of startup life that would have tripped you up before.When you’re suddenly transplanted into a different culture, blunders are inevitable. But like the creators of Youtube (which was You will come to relish these realizations of your errors, because they are signposts that point the way to success. In Peter Skillman’s famous “Why did the kindergarteners triumph? The professionals would spend the majority of their time planning, so by the time they actually put together a tower, it would usually crash down, leaving them no time to rebuild. The kindergarteners, on the other hand, made an attempt in the first few seconds. When their tower tumbled, they would pick up the pieces and try again, this time with slightly different tactics. They repeated this over and over, their tower getting stronger and taller each time, far outpacing the older and supposedly wiser team.At home, you may feel like you have it all figured out. This feeling goes out the window when you’re abroad — in the best way possible. You will make mistakes. You will need to ask for directions and ask for help. And it will leave you with something that can only be learned through experience: humility. You will realize that your opinion or way of doing things shouldn’t necessarily be the loudest in the room, and you will develop a deep respect for the ideas of othersDoes this mean lowering your self-confidence or suppressing your own ideas? Absolutely not! Your heightened awareness of your own fallibility will come hand in hand with an acceptance of it, and a willingness to fearlessly make mistakes. When “fail early; fail often” is your motto and problem-solving is your bread and butter, you won’t be afraid to voice an idea others might disagree with. And you will trust in your heightened communication skills to help you tactfully and effectively express it. You won’t hesitate to try something that might be completely crazy, or might be just crazy enough to work.This combination of confidence and humility is the sweet spot for effective collaboration, and it completes the perfect startup bootcamp that incited the first four elements I’ve described: the abilities to thrive in the unfamiliar, superbly observe and communicate, solve problems with alacrity, and embrace failure and pivots.I am confident that this perfect storm is something that entrepreneurial minds will recognize when you walk into an interview, even if they can’t put it into words. It will mark you as a person who can be trusted with the tasks — great and small — that make or break a new business.

I’ve been holding off from the obligatory “what I’ve learned at a startup” post as there’s a lot of them out there. I felt that the cliches I originally met with skepticism though, like many others yet to embark on a startup journey have been confirmed as true valuable insight and should be shared. So here’s some of my experiences with them so far.You think you know…Yep, the oldest cliche in the startup manual. The mere mention of the term ‘growth hack’ seems to stir a rage in some people. It’s overused and the backlash is crazy but it’s also a set of tactics and a mindset that can be critical to reach that elusive hockey stick. If all those buzz words in one sentence didn’t make you sick in your mouth then read on. It’s not just A/B testing a landing page, it’s embracing experimentation and using the tools you have at your disposal right from the start to drive more sign ups or conversions and find a sustainable channel. We all know the examples of dropbox, hotmail etc (google Lean Startup stipulates to get your minimum viable product out there quickly and track how users interact then iterate fast until you’ve got your product. While I do think taking a design thinking approach to understanding your target users first is helpful to define what to test, you really won’t learn at the rapid rate you can do when your product is in the hands of the user. There are always things you can tweak and add and design you can improve on but this cycle can be never ending. Just get it out the door and improve from the feedback and data. Endless amounts of user testing and prototypes were great, but it was only when we released it into the wild that the fun began. It’s scary as shit too! But just move fast.You might think having an awesome product and a defined job role is enough to get you success, but it’s not. You’re required to get your hands dirty in every aspect of the business and by far the biggest is selling it. We’ve got a pretty well mapped out growth strategy that’s working and now we’re picking up a steady flow of clients but the initial few were tough and when your limited marketing budget ($0.00) is running dry, you have to keep the numbers coming in! So much so that I spent days on end manually searching and inviting potential users through LinkedIn to join the product. It was soul destroying but we gained around an extra 20% of conversions. #WINNING.This is probably the most talked about and truest cliche — it’s tough. It can be mentally and emotionally draining with even the smallest of constructive criticism making you want to lay on the floor and reflect on life choices for the rest of day but you love it, right? Because if you didn’t love it you’d quit because you’re sane.Similar experiences? Let me know your thoughts and feel free to share comments on the above.Co-Founder  Product Manager at Yudoozy.

No amenazaba ruina, pero He de decir una cosa. Llegados a este punto recuerdo que tuve la capacidad de bajarme del torbellino durante un par de minutos para pensar: Yo creo que este formato internacional -más de 700 ciudades, 123.000 participantes, 13.000 startups creadas- , y tan bien ejecutado como lo fue por el equipo de Cosfera, te imbuye de tal forma que llegas a ver posible lo que el primer día no te lo parecía en absoluto.

“On a scale of 1–10 how happy are you?”“In life?… or on the job?”“On the job of course.”My boss looked at me expectantly. I recalled the past year chained to my desk, lethargic and uninspired, surrounded by three hulking monitors, pointlessly nitpicking data points in desperate attempt to seem busy. Automatically I defaulted towards the politically correct number 7 — better than average, not phenomenal, but acceptable. But was I a 7? No, definitely less.“He sighed, “That’s not good, Lisa.” My facade was up, but honestly, I was relieved that he recognized my unhappiness. He continued, “Many people accept being unhappy in their jobs because they’re afraid of risk, of the struggle it takes to figure out how to do what they really love. I encounter this fear almost every day, especially among my high-achieving peers. We are funneled into jobs as consultants, investment bankers, analysts, and we stay for the required two years or more, even when we realize within the first few weeks that our glittering ivy league degrees have left us woefully unprepared for the cold hard reality of cubicle life and a stale marriage to Excel. We dreamed of leading campaigns, of inspiring our community, of impacting policy, of building an empire, of making our mark; instead, we stare at our monitors, editing powerpoints, moving around decimal points, wondering how our mundane work will ever make even an ounce of real impact.Why do we stay? We stay because the job is reputable, because we understand others covet these positions, because it’s expected by society, by our families, by our pride. We stay because we have no idea what else to pursue, because we’re afraid to fail, because as the days wear on, we become increasingly removed from the dreams we once had of improving our food system, or reshaping education, or reversing environmental decline. While we once believed we could change the world, we now resign ourselves to satisfying meaningless metrics, and quietly quelling our anxieties by falling back on a large yet tenuous net of apathy and external expectations. We stay, well, because it’s better to be safe than sorry… right?We’ve heard it a million times: people generally regret the risks they never took significantly more than the mistakes they made. So why haven’t we internalized that yet? Why are we still so afraid to pursue what we want most?Some people rationalize, ‘So when my boss asked me if I was certain I wanted to leave, he was also implying all of the above — ‘Once I answered these questions, it became extremely evident that the biggest mistake I could make would be to stay and do nothing. I asked myself, what makes me unhappy? What excites me? What would I do if money were no matter? What would I do if I stopped caring about how other people perceived me? What would I do if I didn’t let my job title define me?While you won’t figure it all out immediately, what you can do is more clearly define what you value most in a job. For me, those qualities were creativity, transparency, innovation, and ownership. I knew I couldn’t have that in a structured corporate job. I realized that much of my downtime at work was already spent reading about innovative solutions and mobile technology, and I was amazed at the amount of creative energy bouncing around, amplified by peers my age. ‘Quitting a great job is terrifying, but if you want to find something you love, you can’t half-heartedly dabble a little here and a little there. Ultimately, what you must do is create your vision, and go after it with an unwavering drive, an eye towards risk, a stubborn indignance, a sense of urgency, and just enough faith that things will work out if you have the courage to try.Just keep asking yourself, ‘Startup musings

You see it all the time. A young, invincible hustler-hacker team join together as startup co-founders to pursue a dream of becoming the next Google or Facebook. The hustler takes the CEO title while the hacker becomes the CTO. All is good, right? Well, maybe not. Many first-time startup CEOs know there will probably be a time in the future when they will need to decide if they want to be rich or be the king, which translates to a possible need to step down as CEO and bring in someone with more experience. The CEO learns this by getting asked by investors if they insist on remaining the CEO forever. What about the CTO? The dilemma is different but has similar implications. Let’s explore further.As the hacker in the two-person team, the startup CTO does everything of a technical nature. Of course, this means writing the software code or designing the first printed circuit board (PCB). But it also means selecting the hosting infrastructure for the software to run on, the underlying software stack, the technical architecture, the source code management tools, etc., etc. No big surprise there. What about creating a company website, administering the wireless router in the office, helping fix the CEO’s laptop when it gets a virus, and administering the company’s email server? Yes, the CTO does all of that, too, plus sweep the floor of the house they work from and pick up the mail from the local post office box. The dilemma comes into play when the company grows and starts adding more technical talent. Many of the things the CTO did in the early days will get assigned to others. Eventually the CEO and the management team will realize they need someone to oversee the day-to-day development operations (software or hardware) and someone to just be the technical visionary and technical spokesperson for the company. This translates into one VP of Engineering (or related title) and one CTO. Which role is best for the founding CTO based on their skills and future aspirations? If the answer is overseeing the day-to-day development operations, the “Chief” title goes away and there can be a perception of a demotion when, in fact, both roles are critical to the company’s success and continued growth. You can up-level the title to “Senior VP,” but if you’re only a 30-employee company it might look a little silly to have Sr. VPs. The truth is any title that doesn’t have “Chief” in it can seem like a demotion to someone who had it prior.I commonly advise startup founders to Maybe I’m the only one that gets annoyed by this, but it drives me nuts when a five-person startup gives everyone a Chief ____ title. I don’t think it’s needed if all five founders are experienced and with prior successful exits. So you can imagine my reaction when I see a five-employee startup team with less than 10 years of cumulative experience between them who have titles like Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Revenue Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Product Officer.Visit Amazon Web Services Startup Program.

It was only while rushing to get to the tube amidst a summer storm that I realised it: the last summer I spent in London was 16 years ago.In 1999, during my degree’s “industrial placement”, I worked at a large investment bank. It was during the bull period for the world’s financial markets, and the spirits were high in the City.Within 16 years, change is inevitable. Some happened through specific ‘black swan’ events: another investment bank, occupying the floor right below my then-office, filed the industry’s Fast forward to today, and it is this level of intense activity that brings me here again: our digital health startup But shortly after touch-paying for my £2.90 tube ride, the trail of thought led to Athens: my “home city”, in a country that has been battered, unstable, and with the uncertainty of its junk bond status. Charting its 16-year course would be challenging (as I’ve moved cities a few times since then), but it was inevitable to start the comparison engine…You may be in for a surprise.You can’t escape the bustling activity of Above ground, there are cranes everywhere for new developments — offices for more companies or buildings for more students, professionals and families to call home. On the ground, the number of co-working spaces and events is growing and still reaching capacity, as more and more people of all ages start out on their own or want to feel part of the ever-growing community. (Case in point: only a couple of weeks before the MassChallenge UK programme kicked off in June, its As for under-ground… well, if this is any indication, the London Underground service is expanding with more lines under construction, and aims to A couple of years ago, I came across the term “In In 2012, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) introduced generous tax incentives (the Beyond the government’s measures, though, venture capital is in no short supply, with firms seeking to invest slightly higher amounts than before but still eager to participate early on.In Apparently, So what does this make This is not really the case with most young people in Thankfully, there is a more optimistic perspective: compared to London, at least, wages are lower and the potential is there.

I follow the startup scene in Lisbon from a safe distance. It’s good to be close enough to understand what is going on, and it’s important not to focus too much and lose perspective. The same applies to a number of startups abroad.For quite some time, I have felt we are building a broken ecosystem, akin to the dotcom era.This list could go on and you have surely found a great deal of rants and nay-sayers. The scenario is so psychedelic that we have began calling some startups ‘unicorns’, because their perceived value is over 1 Bilion.Which isn’t to say that there aren’t worthwhile companies bringing in true innovation to the world. They are just outside the spotlight, most of the times at least. The startup-circus sells more newspapers, gets more page views and is much more entertaining to watch.There are also some sound professionals that give their best possible advice and guidance. Sometimes this requires the modesty to admit mistakes, failures and fears. Again, we have to cut through the noise of the startup-circus so we can listen.The web is filled with a discourse that can be divided in 2 categories. It’s either inspirational or pragmatic.The problem I see in pragmatic content is that it focuses in the end result, applying any means necessary. It is therefore no wonder that we have seen a rise in ‘growth hackers’ instead of performance engineers or marketing managers.Ironically, most pragmatic content lacks the ethics and values present in the inspirational category, which in turn is often guilty of over simplifying and lacking pragmatism.Matters become worse when countless hours of reading from both categories lead us to conclude none of it can be applied to the problem we have. Books are a good exception to this rule, they can be inspirational, pragmatic and their knowledge applied to a large number of similar problems.This is the point where I could claim that sharing knowledge that is both inspirational and pragmatic could save the startup business everywhere and fix the broken ecosystem. I wont, because it won’t work. At this point, focusing in improving content being shared requires a lot of effort and risks drowning in the deluge of noise and babble.We need a shift in how we think and build strategies. Part of the shift means measuring startups by what they are worth and not by their perceived (future) value.My proposal for this measurement is user growth and participation. A large part of what follows is taken from Eric Ries’ book ‘The chart felt like a good indicator of the health of the startup and a radar to pin point where the UX challenges were. The problem was that the chart was specific to a company.As a solution, I built a scale of participation for the different types of users:This scale was built after reading a paper titled ‘With this framework in place we are able to collect data on what actions are being performed and ascertain the level of participation (engagement) of the users with the site. This sort of monthly or quarterly report can later be used by marketing and UX, investors and management.Cross referencing this information with geographical data and demographic data helps marketing plan in a more strategic way.UX and graphic designers can focus their attention in specific actions or steps of the user journey.Management and Investors can use the data to make decisions and adjust their strategy.Given the required transparency, the startup ecosystem would know for a fact the health of each company inside it.This raises questions regarding the value of a User and if that value should change over time or not. There is also the question if we are dealing with unique users, such as what is supposed to happen with Facebook, or duplicate users, like what happens on Reddit. Let’s agree that this use of User Participation as a metric for startups as a whole is close to a Utopia.Yet, startups seeking funding should rely heavily on user participation and share that information with their investors, if for no other reason to show their money is being put to good use.This metric is also a valuable tool for those managing collaboration and knowledge management within a company. In a granular level, you will be able to pinpoint the most active users and the ones less engaged with the tools you are using.Not all, but most of the startups will die if their managers and investors switch to metrics that focus on user participation and behaviour. There will be no pivot tactic or funding round to save them. That is a good thing, believe me.The startup circus is crowding the ecosystem and keeping the truly valuable companies from thriving.You can argue that this sudden demise will mean less choice for the user. It will no doubt mean less choice, and it will also mean less crappy options to choose from. Users will also be forced to demand more out of the good and services they are purchasing online. From this, the startup may see the need for a premium / paid service instead of dragging around a freemium service plan that in the end may result in its demise.Dynamic Systems have a way of stabilizing themselves. The startup ecosystem is not different.Some startups are dead already. They are feeding on vanity metrics, page views and distracted investors.The only way to stop these Zombies is from within the management or through the investors. This is where the hard work comes in.This attitude is hard and harsh, but please refrain from telling me it’s not possible. It is imperative to focus more on the ones worth saving. The only way to know which ones will survive is to bring back a focus on the user and hard business metrics.Digital Strategist based in Lisbon and full time geek. Likes coffee and bicycles.

In 2014 I participated in the wild, fast-paced startup competition known as The week leading up to my trip on StartupBusNYC, I tried to prepare myself by reading a couple blog posts from people who had gone the year before. The advice was relatively perfunctory: bring snacks, USB drives, a mifi hotspot. What I really wanted to know was If you’re reading this, you’re likely considering whether to go, or you’re preparing for the unknown. Here I’ll address non-technical pre-departure concerns and will try to paint a semi-objective picture of what it’s like to be there.In short, the trip is as exhilarating as it is exhausting. Typically five or six teams are formed on each bus, and the majority of your time will be spent in the bus working intensely with your team, then squeezing in a couple more hours of work in your shared hotel room. If that sounds fairly peaceful, think again.Expect a feverish pace and plenty of unknowns. For one, the bus will stop for surprise events. As ridiculous as it may sound, these events often felt like a zany cross between professional development and those wacky contest shows like Nickelodeon Later that day at a mall food court, a contingent of us took over a carousel and the rest of us ran around playing games at an arcade. Looking at it this way, StartupBus is fun — fun like summer camp if it were actually really stressful and full of techy grown-ups.The days on the bus are long by any account. By law, the bus driver is supposed to get eight hours of sleep, but this had little bearing on how much sleep any of us would be getting. From what I saw, only the bus itself had eight hours of downtime. Arriving at the hotel late into the night, the process of simply checking in could take hours (isn’t there an app for that?). Before we could shuffle off to sleep, our mentors would have each team come by to pitch and get critiqued, and then we’d do more of the same during breakfast the next morning. Hours for sleeping were cut down to about four per night, maximum. Adrenaline kept most teams working late into the night anyway, further cutting into sleep. On the night before the final competition when everyone was on their last legs, energy-wise, most everyone still managed to pull an all-nighter. Looking at it this way, StartupBus is still fun — fun like college fueled by an overabundance of coffee instead of alcohol.The packed schedule, plus the pressure to create your product, reach your milestones, and perfect your pitch, is intense. Looking at it this way, StartupBus has more in common with a presidential campaign trail. At least one of the buses had seen that kind of action—rumor had it that one of the charter buses was used by Mitt Romney years ago.Amid all the intensity, shit will go wrong. Our bus got stuck on an iced-over highway and we collectively had to scramble to change our route. It was freezing. We ate through our provisions. Evening turned to night as we yearned for the hotel rooms we were long overdue for. A pregnant woman hobbled across the ice and begged entrance onto the bus to use our toilet. It was halfWhat is often not explicitly stated with intense social situations like these is that they are the quickest, most effective way for people to form deep and lasting bonds. All the trials and tribulations of summer camp or college are condensed into three days. It’s like a pressure chamber for making friends. For adults, social opportunities like this are exceedingly rare. This is the real reason why StartupBus is an amazing experience. Just remember to try to get the seats at the front of the bus (the toilet is in the back).Now, for some advice.Having the opportunity to go on StartupBus is a privilege. Even still, I didn’t know if I could swing it, or wanted to. My given reason at the time was “I’m too thirty for that,” but my real reason was a combination of opportunity cost (a whole week away from my fledgling business), real costs (the $300 fee, hotels, a flight back) and good old fashioned fear: I was only a recent entrant into the world of web design and development, the skill set I would ostensibly be bringing to the table, and I was intimidated by the caliber of the other participants. Thankfully I ignored these concerns and just went for it.I shoved my trepidations aside after attending two alumni events where I met former buspreneurs who ticked my same boxes: thirty-somethings, women, non-whites, and people that weren’t hardcore technical geniuses.The events went a long way in convincing me. The alumni clearly had a cohesive community going and it seemed like a pretty cool bunch of people. I mean, who wants to spend 72 consecutive hours geeking out over a new project with a bunch of strangers, stopping off in places like Roanoke or Tuscaloosa? That adventuresome spirit isn’t just for the young and crazy, it’s for good-natured, curious people who like to put themselves to the test. That’s my kind of people.If you aim to keep costs low, you could head home immediately after the competition in Nashville and skip the festivities altogether, but I would highly advise against this. In previous years, StartupBus convened in time for SXSWi in Austin, and though the conference in Nashville is quite different, it’ll be worth it.Don’t underestimate the fact that you’ll have just bonded with 30 new friends. Everyone will be hanging out together after going through a crucible of stress and hard work. Join in already. I’m fairly good at being a curmudgeon and I still was inspired to yolo it up all over town.Expect that you’ll want to stay to bask in the post-StartupBus glow. Kevin Galligan, a 2012 buspreneur and 2014 judge of the final competition, said that simply wearing his StartupBus hoodie around town served to help him make connections with people from other buses. These are your new friends if you stick around and spend time with them.Last year, most of us stayed an extra few days after the final competition, making for a week-long trip in total.Organize shared housing with your busmates as soon as you know you’re going. With lots of people storming Nashville at the same time, you might want to act quickly if you want to find an Airbnb or hotel room, let alone one that’s close by and not outrageously overpriced.Last year I went ahead and booked an Airbnb house before I even knew who would join in. Even still we ended up with a run-down place that was far away — and far from cheap. But it worked out. By the time we got there, six people who wanted to stay had already ponied up their share and four more wanted to glom on at the last minute.Get a place that’s within walking distance. You’ll want to be in and out regularly because of the timing of events, meeting up with different people, and the fact that your tired ass will be sneaking in daytime naps after the sleepless half of the trip.Some people found cheaper hotel rooms further away but it put a damper on their social life. Going out is the reason for going at all, so do it right.Aside from logistics, there are other important things to prepare. Here’s a big one: in the weeks leading up to the trip, think about a product idea you might like to pitch.“Everyone pitches” was a common refrain heard on the bus. Not only does this mean that everyone on a team was expected to get up and pitch their company regularly, it also meant that everyone had to pitch at least one idea when we first boarded the bus. This increases the “we’re all in this together” feel and also makes sure that lots of ideas are floating around when it comes time to form teams.Some people who prefaced their pitch with “I didn’t expect to share this, but…” ended up forming a team around their idea. Bonus points for well thought out concepts: Madelena Mak, a top designer, passed out slick illustrated booklets when she pitched her idea for MiniMap. Guess what — not only did she pull a fantastic team together, the team made it all the way to the finals.This is a bit of an odd suggestion, as it may seem creepy to internet-stalk your future busmates before seeing them IRL, but it served me very well. Before the trip, the StartupBus website publishes brief bios of each buspreneur, accompanied by a photo and short list of each person’s skills. One night before the trip I sat at a bar and read through everyone’s bio.The next day when I met my future busmates at a pre-trip party, I already had a leg up and was able to start matching faces to names. It helps because you have to act fast to meet so many new people. Knowing each person’s skill set can also give you an edge when it comes time to form teams.To be honest, I worried that my skills would not be on par with my fellow buspreneurs. For fuck’s sake, I’d been designing and building for clients for years, but when you work alone, no one gives you a promotion or pats you on the back to say “nice job.” Earning a living and having happy clients is one form of proof, but if you work for yourself, you don’t often get to see how you stack up against others.Given that each participant is expected to fill one of three roles — developer, designer, or “hustler” (i.e. business development) — if I were out of my depth I might end up being a lame teammate, or worse, a dead weight. As a conscientious and empathetic person, that was an awful prospect to consider.I may have had a double anxiety about this, as a female and as someone whose design and development skills are entirely self-taught. Call it gender-related performance anxiety. Anyone would be embarrassed if their skills didn’t cut it. But since the tech world of hackathons and startups is dominated by “rockstar” programmer dudes, the possibility that I might not “deserve” to be there haunted me. As a woman, the implication of getting somewhere The feeling that you may be unmasked as a fraud is a common one when you contend with groups of high-caliber professionals who demonstrate their value in a competitive and public way. I’m harping on this point because I eventually found there were a number of others who felt unsure as well—and I should note that When you’re self-taught and work alone, there’s a lot of shadow boxing. StartupBus is full of people who regularly do hackathons, but for me it was the first time I developed a web application with other people. It was immensely illuminating. This is how best practices are spread. (And realizing how often skilled people rely on Google to figure out how to solve problems was a great relief.)It quickly became obvious that each person brought to the table more than just their raw skills, and some of these things made all the difference. Domain expertise, humor, willingness to get up and talk in front of a crowd, and other personality traits had a critical place.My team consisted of two designers and four developers, so we sometimes split things up. One developer who also had film editing skills made a great video for our landing page. Another developer doubled as a data scientist. I shifted over to “hustling” and PR when I saw that the other designer had our bases covered. But another way of looking at my team was that we had a jokester who was great for morale, and a couple indefatigable team members to rope us all back in. For a three-day competition, that mattered a lot more than who was the dopest with Javascript.Alternately, if your skills are best used elsewhere, you can always switch teams. When you belong to a good community there will be a place for you. If you’ve been asked to belong to this community, quit second guessing yourself—you’re a good fit.Technically StartupBus teams compete against each other, particuarly against the teams from other buses. But that’s just the grand finale, and while it’s intense, it’s done in good humor. Everything leading up to that is highly collaborative, though it’s done in the language of competition. I found the whole experience to be much more about cooperation than about fighting to win.This is a key facet of the entire StartupBus organization. It’s run by people who participated in years past and the community aspect is deeply reinforced. It’s evidenced by the tribal affinity you develop with your teammates and it continues long after you get back. On the whole, the StartupBus experience is distinct in its dedication to building and maintaining a strong community.The question of how exactly teams get formed was brought up by a lot of us before we got on the bus. The answer is that it happens insanely fast — in literally a matter of minutes. Before our bus made its first stop for a coffee break, teams were already formed and hard at work. It seems like not nearly enough time to make sure you have the “right” team. But what do you expect when you’re supposed to have a product by the end of the first day?Here’s how my team, It’s a bit like musical chairs. The only difference is no one gets left out. Our team started with a gargantuan seven people, and later in the day one of our own, Nicole Dominguez (who had even chosen our company’s name) switched to another team that needed her formidable design skills. There is inevitably some shuffling but from what I could tell everyone was really pleased with their team.Yes, teams did tend to form around shared competencies: some Android developers stuck together; my own team had Ruby on Rails in common. But some teams were a totally mixed bag and relied on one developer to build the product.Looking back, forming a great team is less about skill sets and more about mutual passion for the idea, a sense of humor and camaraderie, and shared goals. When I say shared goals, I expecially mean the goal of winning, or of not caring about winning. Not all girls just wanna have fun: some people want to find a project that lets their skills stand out in a big way. At the same time, plenty of people don’t care all that much about making it to the finals. If some people on your team are intent on winning and others aren’t, that could be a schism that disappoints and stresses everybody out.While StartupBus is ostensibly an opportunity to form a real company, this is not an explicit goal for most participants. That doesn’t mean there aren’t some big successes. Salman Ansari, a developer who had built and sold a company before getting on the bus, said he joined “for shits and giggles.” I think it’s fair to say he was not alone. I myself joined because I thought three days of making friends and working on something new would be a lot of fun regardless of the results. And it was, particularly because my team was all on the same page—we just really loved the concept we were working on.Whether it’s the sleepless nights, the exhaustion, the pressure, the stage fright, the bus toilet, or the weak hotel coffee, you will suffer. Like a rough road trip, it all adds up to the kind of fun you have when you don’t realize you’re having fun.And then there are the times — like when fifty of us from the US and Mexico ran around the Alamo like Pee Wee Herman — when you realize you’re actually having fun. Later, when a team from our bus was declared the winner, we stomped and hollered so loud you’d swear we were real Texans at a hootenanny.Even when you’ve lost your ability to keep your eyes open, you’ll still be having fun. Remember this when you lay your head down to pass out under a table after the final competition.Without a doubt, going on StartupBus kicked my ass. I won’t lie: in my first week back I was actually bitter. I thought my mentors had been hard on me, pointing out some daunting things about myself that knocked the wind out of my sails. It didn’t help that I also caught a massive cold.After recovering from sleep deprivation and sickness, I spent time obsessing over my personal successes and failures on the trip. Moments where I was an unflinching bad-ass, moments where I let my team down, and everything in between. StartupBus is a proving ground. Proving grounds are always rough terrain, but they’re necessary if you want to know the truth about yourself under pressure. If you’re considering a future in startups, this is a great crash course—not in how to build a company, but in how to deal with yourself and others in a high-stakes environment.My biggest takeaway was realizing Upon my return, I couldn’t help but look at my yawningly unfinished projects with a critical eye. I saw that my future would remain on idle as long as I let it, but that I could break out with some down-and-dirty intense work. Within two months of returning, I founded and launched a publication; within six months I pivoted my company and launched a new product. It’s been a year since I got on the bus, the most successful year of my life.Oh, yeah, and I have 30 new friends who are fucking excellent—smart, successful, capable, connected, helpful and cool as fuck. I’ve collaborated with some, gone on trips with others, and celebrated with all of them. That alone made it worth it.—Founding editor of New Worker Magazine. Entrepreneur, designer, writer.

Have you ever been asked how your startup is doing and answered with something like “Everything’s OK, nothing special”? What were you really thinking? And did you really join or create a startup because you wanted to do Tech startups, operate in one of the fastest ever changing industries in the world. Things that cost a team years to research, design and develop can often be copied and improved within weeks. No matter how big a tech company is, a group of nerds can challenge it right from the comfort of their couch.So how good should a team really do to survive the year? The answer is: Definitely not “OK”.Let’s break down a possible lifecycle of the average startup:You have invented something that will change the world. You wake up every day motivated to make it a reality, making huge leaps forward with every step you take. The first prototype is promising, your friends and their friends like it.You are not unique. Competition is better than you thought. You launched the first version, people didn’t stick with it. You need funding to really make it to the market but investors are hesitant and the round is harder to close than you thought.Something worked out. Either one of the big media companies picked you up, a big partnership came about or your revenue started to grow.You did it — you received funding. You are still a small team with a considerable amount of cash in your bank account. This is the most freedom you will ever experience in the life of this project. The world is your oyster.You hire, try out stuff, growth is not super-fast but measurable. This next feature/campaign/hire will make you nail it. Media attention is low, but all in all it’s not worse than before, right?Ok, something went wrong. You need to pull it around ASAP. Everything goes now — what can we change? Let’s slim everything down, let’s be radical, let’s kick ass like we did a year ago!This is the place where 9 in 10 startups leave the market. Only one will pull it around and head on to a new rollercoaster of ups and downs.Avoiding those stages in the first two years of a startup is almost impossible. One of the biggest improvements a startup can do is seizing the (A startup is an “organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model“ — It’s an experiment with a huge deadline in form of a cash-filled hourglass. If the startup is doing “OK” it is not learning anything.Make your team and yourself understand that each week you are doing OK, there is a lot of room for improvement. One of our team members once said: “Of course it’s At our startup, Now you could ask yourself: “Am I doing OK?”CEO and Co-Founder of Your battles, your stories.

There is a lot of speculation surrounding how to define a pre-accelerator and how this form of acceleration differs from traditional accelerators. The main difference between these two types of programs is in the different stages of the startups they admit.Traditional accelerators such as Put simply, a pre-accelerator takes on startups that are at an even This process Hackathons are flooded with the world’s most talented and brightest minds, many of which are overlooked. Investors have always seen hackathons as great opportunities to source deals with talented hackers, but there typically wasn’t a formal process which guided these deals. Enter AngelHack.Approximately 79% of AngelHack’s hackathon attendees consist of developers and designers, with little to no background in business development. This makes these talented hackers vulnerable as founders, sometimes leading them to accept investment from individuals who provide little to no value aside from the checks they hand out. In their book Being the largest and most global developer ecosystem, AngelHack found itself in the premier position to provide this missing value. Teams who join the HACKcelerator gain access to AngelHack’s extensive network of mentors, business partners, and community leaders who can add value to their experience. Teams also get to enjoy being spotlighted to our engaged community of 50,000+ of developers and innovators, who are always on the lookout for the tech industry’s Next Big Thing.Milan Koch, AngelHack’s Director of Incubation and Acceleration, summarizes the measures taken to de-risk the HACKcelerator teams below.Because our teams are admitted straight out of hackathons, the HACKcelerator has a distinct advantage of vetting raw technical talent. However, AngelHack does partner with technology giants in the industry to provide additional guidance where needed. For example, this year, AngelHack has partnered with HP’s Haven OnDemand team to provide technical support for the HACKcelerator teams throughout the program.Taking the need for a minimum viable product and proof of customer validation into consideration, the program follows a three-phased, business and tech balanced curriculum, that leverages AngelHack’s extensive network of global developers, entrepreneurs, and investors to produce startups from hacks that are attractive to investors.The HACKcelerator also follows a performance-based model to ensure the graduation of top-flight startups. Participating teams have to meet weekly milestones to reserve their spot on the stage at Global Demo Day.While pre-accelerators don’t generally boast the high portfolios traditional accelerators do, AngelHack’s HACKcelerator has experienced a lot of success in the area.But the biggest proof of success is seen in how quickly the concept has been adopted globally. Solo companies have sprung into existence to join the pre-acceleration movement, and larger companies, such as 500 Startups, have created pre-acceleration programs of their own. The entry requirements of such companies vary vastly, with the HACKcelerator remaining as the only pre-accelerator working with hackathon winners.All in all, AngelHack continues to seek new ways to increase opportunity for passionate innovators in the ever-changing tech industry.AngelHacker — Bringing tech  innovation to the Middle East

In the roughly 18 months between the announcement of a presidential campaign and Election Day, the general election candidates will likely have raised and spent over a billion dollars each. They will have built an organization with hundreds of paid staffers and untold thousands more in volunteers. Beyond that, the formal campaign organization is just one part of a large ecosystem of organizations working to support the campaign in coordinated and uncoordinated ways.Even the fast-growing startups in Silicon Valley have not seen growth this explosive or complex. Snapchat, one of the fastest, was valued at $2 billion just two years after founding, and in less than three years has raised over a billion dollars in funding. But the presidential campaigns will hit that mark in half the time.This rate of growth is a major management challenge. There are certainly lessons to learn from the tech startup experience. These are among the handful of modern companies that have dealt with truly exponential growth and the struggle of scaling at superhuman speed.But despite the lessons from Silicon Valley, there are also differences in the practical logistics between today’s tech startups and presidential campaigns. A tech startup can leverage a small number of staffers to support a large digital footprint or a broad user base. But a presidential campaign requires a comparatively large staff. They need to organize at the local level, engage with national and local media, test messages, create ads, produce events, and more. They are in a race to 50.1 percent, with a monopoly for the winner.The nature of this ‘business’ requires many people all working in concert during a short period of time toward that single goal. Growing the team in an effective way in line with resources is a significant challenge. Go too fast and you won’t have the resources to compete when it matters; go too slow and you won’t be in a position to take advantage of opportunities. This differs by the type of race, as well. Incumbents have the luxury of saving resources for the general election. Underdogs in the primary have to pick their spots and place their bets.Of course, a presidential campaign is not a business. There is no profit or loss; there is just Election Day and win or lose. And there are rules and systems for campaigns that the business world does not have to deal with, in terms of limits on fundraising and the party and third party apparatus that exist around the campaigns. Some of this complexity creates more problems, and some offers solutions to the scaling problem. Indeed, outside groups offer one way to relieve the pressure of scaling rapidly.The problem is how to help staff get up this learning curve. Many campaign staffers are young and lack significant work or management experience.So if you were to create a cheat sheet of lessons from start-up thinking, MBA thinking, and campaign thinking, what would that look like and what lessons would it hold for the teams on the presidential campaigns that are just now beginning?There are many ways to think about this, but there are four common themes across all three of these disciplines that any campaign should pay attention to. First, the culture of the campaign and how it works; second, the management style and how people are organized; third, the strategy of how a campaign makes decisions; and fourth, the systems defining how a campaign is able to scale.Whether it’s the “No Asshole Rule” from Stanford’s Robert Sutton or the president’s campaign approach of “No drama Obama,” both the business world and the political world recognize the power of culture in an organization. Former GE Chairman Jack Welch has a good way of talking about culture. He largely abandons the idea of organizational ‘values’ in favor of thinking about ‘behaviors.’ This is a much more concrete way of thinking about culture, while still acknowledging the core importance of the topic. What would the effective behaviors of a presidential campaign look like? It’s probably different for each, but some basic ground rules for campaign life might be:1. Pay attention to detail. Presidential campaigns are under the microscope and the little things matter. Own your work from the details to the big picture.2. Make mistakes once, but not twice. It is good for people to learn, but there isn’t enough time for people to have to learn from the same mistake over and over.3. Spend time on things that matter. Understand what matters for your personal big picture and spend time appropriately. This doesn’t mean that everyone’s job is big picture strategy, but regardless of the role, some things always have more impact than others; figure out how to make the important things your focus.Culture is the unspoken structure that allows people to make decisions within a broader shared framework of how to think and behave. A high functioning culture enables less rules-based management and ultimately empowers individuals to make greater contributions. Every new staffer should understand what the organization values and it should echo through every meeting.Given the hours and the pay, it’s no surprise that campaigns are a young person’s game. But that fact also points to the importance of actively thinking about management and how to do it effectively. This isn’t a skill set that comes early, so many on a presidential campaign may have no experience managing others at all.It’s important to understand that management is fundamentally about leveraging people’s time. A manager should be able to organize their team’s time and effort to make the group more effective than they would be otherwise. This implies that if you are not making other people better at their job, you are not managing properly.Some basic approaches for good management:1. Push work down while training people up to do the job. Don’t worry, there is always more work that will come. Make yourself dispensable.2. Encourage and practice transparency. Try to give people context for the work they are doing and why it matters.3. Create the space for feedback. You want your team to tell you when there’s a problem, but you also need to create the opportunity for them to do so. Sometimes this is as simple as saying, “if there’s a problem, tell me.”Different people will have different styles, but remember: the right style is the one that gets the best out of your team, not the one that you are most comfortable with. Practice different styles.Strategy is a difficult concept and in the political world it can often be mistaken for tactics. These are two different things. You can have multiple strategies, but they each must entail a choice and a trade-off within the campaign limitations of time and money.If your primary calendar strategy is to win Iowa, then time spent outside the state does not contribute to achieving that strategy, unless your persuasion strategy is driven by ad buys paid for by out-of-state fundraising.When evaluating strategy, one of the most useful questions to ask yourself is: what would you have to believe about the future for this to be a good strategy? This test lays out the assumptions, and in developing strategy, assessing assumptions is as important as evaluating the strategy itself, especially in ambiguous situations common to campaigns.The ability to scale is most dependent on the strength or weakness of the systems underlying the campaign. Systems can scale; individual dependencies can’t. Systems are the foundations that allow you to make fast decisions and focus on what’s important down the road. Put time into how you process information, how you organize people, and how you make decisions. Time spent making systems effective has a multiplying effect as the campaign moves on.The Obama campaign did this with a structured salary system where people slotted into predetermined levels. There was no negotiation, which saved time and energy, while simultaneously creating a structure staffers perceived as fair.Likewise, every modern presidential campaign has had an hour or more of email or network outage at some critical moment (every moment is) where people were unable to access the tools to do their job. Smart campaigns will figure out how to use Box, Dropbox, Slack, or Google Apps to simply outsource this function and ensure an IT system that will scale so they can focus on other things.One of the great challenges of a presidential campaign is dealing with the crisis of the next five minutes and carving out enough time to work on the things that will help you in five weeks or five months. That balance can be especially difficult between strategic and tactical priorities, as you are pulled into the tactical crisis of the moment.Campaigns have always moved quickly, but modern campaigns are bigger and faster than ever, and managing this new reality effectively will require tips and tricks from other disciplines and situations.For campaigns that run especially lean until their ‘moment,’ it will be critical to grow in a smart way. When and how to scale a modern presidential campaign is the management achievement that could put someone in the White House.

I’ve been lucky enough to mentor on multiple If you’re thinking of getting involved in this world, here’s some food for thought.This is really important. In many cases, you’re mentoring companies that are new. Their product isn’t fully refined or even properly defined. They haven’t figured out their market, their sales strategy or their target customers. In short, they are not perfect.Your job is to help them. It’s not to tell them the product is shit, their business model is shit or they are shit. If any of those things are true, then part of your job as a mentor should become pretty clear pretty quickly.Pointing out every mistake, misstep and misunderstanding early stage companies have made doesn’t make you look big, clever, smart or more worldly. It makes you look like what you are — a tool.At Also, be clear about when you’re available and when you’re busy. There’s nothing worse than feeling like a company is pestering you or they feel an advisor is deliberately avoiding them when they’re actually on holidays.Everyone’s busy. Very few people are so busy that they can’t muster up time for a chat every week in person, on Skype or on the phone. If you make a commitment to help a company, stick to it.With I suspect some of the startups that I mentor hate me. In our initial sessions, I’ll talk about some connections that I can introduce them to, and then they don’t get that connection for two months. This is really important — particularly in an accelerator setting — you should only intro people when they are ready. Introducing a company to a potential partner or customer when it’s too early for either is a great way to ensure that intro leads nowhere.Also, learn how to write good intro emails. Want hints? Check See the first point — don’t be a dick, but don’t sugarcoat, don’t overflatter, don’t Being a board member, a mentor or an advisor is something in between being a HR person and a therapist. One of the best things you can do for any company you work with is help them to hire. I’m constantly listening to conversations to figure out who’s available, who’s wobbling in their current role, who might be interesting to talk to and who might make a huge difference for the company or companies I’m working with.If you’re doing this, it’s usually because you have a network, some credibility or some expertise. Assuming that’s the case, you’re likely to be meeting people and having some reasonably relevant conversations. Whilst I hope I’m not a pub bore when it comes to the companies I work with, I do talk about them and insert them into presentations and relevant conversations.Spend a lot of time (I usually aim for three months) figuring out if you and the company like/love/loathe one another. If it feels like it’s starting to get serious, then you need to talk. If it’s looking like it might be a longer term relationship, then it’s important to make sure everyone’s interests are aligned. Longer term advisory positions typically involve option grants.Some basic pointers — pick a fixed percentage rather than trying to tie it to hourly rates or any other esoteric equation. Anything over 0.5% in options is excessive. Scale that percentage back for later stage companies or if you’re committing less time. Make sure the options vest over time — two or three years with a one year cliff is probably the best protection for both sides. You can find some good advisory agreements There’s a natural lifecycle that companies and their advisors will go through. At some point along the way, it may become apparent to one or both of you that your advice is better suited for a different stage of that cycle. When that happens, be a grown up and walk away. If you see it happening and the company doesn’t, flag it. If the company sees it coming and you don’t….well then, this video should explain it all.Hardly the 10 commandments, but hopefully a good start.

Amazon has a wonderful ‘bar raiser’ process to ensure that the people being hired increase the overall quality of the team they are being hired for. The thumb rule for any new candidate is this:It’s elegant in its simplicity and more importantly (for me personally), it puts things in engineering terms. This simple filter during every hire process ensures that the candidates being hired are constantly improving the team and driving the bar upwards.That thought has firmed up over the last 8 weeks when I’ve thrust myself into a role that demands me to cook up reality from ideas and vision. This goes into my to do list as: Articulating vision, generating tangible short terms goals, creating roles (within the nebulous order), grooming leaders, designing teams and showing results.I began with certain thumb rules on the typical profile of people I want on this journey. Some rules got validated, some were proven wrong and new rules were added to this. But one thing became very clear:Since rejection was such an important component of the regular hiring process, I have begun to try and formalize what would push a candidate to rejection. These are the alarm bells that would ring in my head and if one too many rang, the benefit of doubt gets cancelled. Usually its certain phrases or responses that trigger these.Big red flag. Usually the candidate follows it up with a statement like: I would be able to do different types of roles in a startup.Candidates who focus on the designation are usually the first to go update their LinkedIn profile after the job change.These candidates are usually worried about how their performance in their given role would be measured. Most times this is followed up with questions on what would happen if another team — whom they are dependent on — screw up. Would they be penalized?These candidates The same people who whine about the constraining nature of the role in a big company. Those The list above is in no way comprehensive or absolute. In fact, hiring is a very personal process that varies wildly depending on the person / organization doing it. I will keep adding to this as I learn more.This is a collections for articles about business including startups, business developments, and management. Managed by 

Is Silicon Valley currently in a bubble? Is the party over?Some very smart people are Others are But what’s clear is this: we’re at the peak of this ~10 year cycle, and every boom comes with a bust. The players in the game (mainly, VCs and startups) have already began bracing for this cycle’s bust by raising as much money as possible and storing it away, drastically reducing funding for risky investments, and negotiating punitive term sheets that would save the VCs in case the startup vaporizes, among other protective measures. Investors like Bill Gurley think we’ll see a couple dead unicorns this year. And he’ll be right.Once a few of those unicorns implode, panic will set in. Investors will pressure startups to start generating revenue instead of focusing on customer acquisition, and will completely cut funding for businesses that don’t have the potential to bring in high profit margins. As First Round Capital’s Rob Hayes pointed out, a game of musical chairs will begin around this time: employees, suddenly unsure of the prospects of the startup they’re working for, scramble to get their old jobs back at Google or Facebook. Except there won’t be a lot of chairs left.BUT… if you have a legitimately disruptive startup (one that isn’t a service based simply off the idea “what can’t I get my mom to do for me?”), you shouldn’t worry. Here’s why.Startups that are disruptive tend to upend the existing model not because they’re necessarily better (although they do get better with more time and cash infusion), but because most of the time, they’re more convenient and less expensive.Think about Starbucks: the coffees/lattes/mochas served at Starbucks are definitely not better than the ones served by, say, a high quality boutique café somewhere in the city. But what Starbucks brings to the table is convenience (it’s everywhere), affordability (compared to the prices that could vary between individual boutique shops) and consistency (yeah, the drinks they serve may not be as great, but at least you know what you’ll be getting, every single time). Because of that, Starbucks has more or less dominated the coffeehouse industry.Now, during a downturn, people are looking to save money. They want the cheapest product or service that they know will serve them reliably. Does your startup do that?Uber does that: Uber X is cheaper than most cab rides. Uber X cars are not only nicer and cleaner than most cabs, but its drivers tend to be more polite too (kudos to the rating system; think about how important this can be during a frustrating time like an economic downturn!), which makes Uber’s value proposition all the more advantageous.Airbnb does that: hotels are expensive, and its prices fluctuate wildly during peak seasons. A traveller can potentially save hundreds, if not more, by renting an apartment on Airbnb (also, as an added bonus, most Airbnbs are much bigger than hotel rooms — for the same price, or even less).Xiaomi does that: people want the best phone, without the price tag. Xiaomi offers just that: the Mi Note, for example, has build quality and specs that rival Samsung’s Galaxy Note at roughy half the price.Netflix does that too. I recently watched In all of the examples above, each company focused on driving down one thing — the one critical thing that everyone thinks about during an economic downturn: the price. Most of them did so without reducing the quality of services/products offered. Now On the other hand, if your startup does neither of those things, but instead provides a service that’s “nice to have” There are, of course, still many startups like Homejoy out there. One of them, Instacart, has raised more than $270 million at a $2 billion (!) valuation from several respectable VC firms. That’s great for Instacart… but when crunch time comes, will its current users still want to pay someone to buy their groceries for them when they could do it themselves? What about when Amazon inevitably pours more money into its Fresh project, which offers same-day and early morning deliveries? Will Instacart still be able to retain its users? Now, take this with a few grains of salt, but some investors in Silicon Valley have already begun worrying about Instacart’s finances out loud.And it’s not just Instacart that may be in deep trouble: GrubHub, Postmates and Seamless’ livelihoods could be threatened after Amazon announced its (See also: Of course, there’s still room for optimism: some of the best services which we use today came out of the economic downturn. Facebook, Google (sending Yahoo! into a tailspin), Salesforce (to compete with Oracle), eBay and Netflix (effectively shutting down Blockbuster) all emerged as victors after brutal economic downturns, killing the previously dominant businesses in their industries.This time around, there will be victors too: products built today that our grandkids may continue to use. But don’t forget how many startups had to die before the smoke cleared, showing a clear picture of the true victors.reporter  researcher | covering S.V.No IT Dept: You’re On Your Own

There’s endless analysis of startups from every angle that it be hard to keep up with. Here’s a simplified (and overgeneralized) guide to the main themes of startups.Wait — hasn’t While GoogleA few companies have done this impressively well. Other startups are also on their way to dominating search in specific categories. The timing of The second key theme revolves around an activity that dates to prehistory. It’s impressive the endless creativity in how and who we communicate with.Unlike my enthusiasm for the unbundling of search, I find it annoying that I must maintain so many communication apps. 😒 I’d much prefer a single app with the all relevant communication functionalities.Overall, I have less insightful commentary on this theme except that I love the sub-theme of communication via photos and emoji 😍. This isn’t completely surprising if you consider that non-verbal communication represents two-thirds of all communicationI thought it was only fair to carve out a distinct theme that’s fitting for the mythical “unicorn” Unfortunately I don’t have time to add more commentary on this theme because I need to walk to work… 😊software engineer; former finance geek

That’s how we started chatting about the heart of the business, about your reason for existence and your Truth.And I started telling you about the lessons I had learnt from the time I first started making internet investments in 1999.Seems a long time ago now, but Truths don’t change, just how we interpret them does.#1 How many of your customers repeat#2 How often do they repeat#3 The rest of your business is just a support system for #1 and #2VCs have a label for it: “finding product-market fit” (PMF). It’s a nice euphemism for “do people really need your s**t”.Why do they focus on this so much?PMF is a marker for a stage in their investment. It’s an important marker since all investments prior to this stage are based on faith in the team, and a general belief in the proposition. But when they see signs of a start-up achieving PMF, that’s the night they sleep well. That’s when they are happy to double-down and put in more money into your business.Till that point it’s like spraying small bullets in the dark. Once you find PMF, they want you to pull out the rocket-launcher and press fire.That’s To make PMF a bit more real for the purpose of this piece, I am going to call it a “cohort” — you can apply any of the labels I’ve used above, or create ones that suit your business.If your cohorts are weak, you have a problem.You can hide it under massive user growth, snuff it with millions of downloads, cover it under some great PR around your fundraise.But when it comes down to the atomic level — when it is just between that single customer and you — there is no place to hide.Demographically and psychographically (ouch, what a mouthful), India probably has the most heterogeneous audience in the world. Language, age and just the sheer new-ness for customers using their smartphone for the first time are things that you are dealing with. New instruments, fear of dealing with online, paranoia of being cheated, fear of making a mistake and being charged for it, are all barriers to a smooth transaction. Add to it the perennial struggle with internet access and download speed.So where does one begin improving cohorts:It starts with a realization that it is not You need to analyze each of these situations separately. Go back to your school days. Start making sets of these cohorts, intersect them, visualize them as people — don’t let them be numbers on an Excel sheet.Work backwards, and attempt to discover or at least imagine the intent behind their actions. That will give rise to meaningful insights.If you’re a pure-play internet company, your business is simply the culmination of your consumers’ micro behaviours — each tiny one matters. (And if you are not pure-play, you need to factor in your employees’ micro behaviours as well.)Times have changed. We are entering a phase where This is a hard-learned lesson from my years in the media business. You should be vitally aware of the “self-fulfilling” error when you analyse your cohorts — some things end up working precisely I call this in-built error the “Anti-Heisenberg Principle”: position can actually determine the momentum! More seriously, it causes huge errors in site design and planning as data analysts focus on consumption without seeing how placement in the mix is forcing that variable.Your design and usage data is its own enemy. Consumers behave along the path you set them. Don’t blame them; it’s like putting trains on a track that goes off a cliff, and then wondering why the data is showing the trains are crashing.Don’t blame the train, blame your track!Data analysis is not all science, it’s quite a bit of art. The link between causation and correlation is flawed and it needs your gut and instinct.A few weeks ago, I had a meeting with the founder of a fairly successful, growing, bootstrapped private label start-up. He had fantastic organic traffic — millions of visitors, great time-spent, but very low sales.The repeat visitors and referral metrics were good but strangely conversion was low. Clearly, people came to the site with an intent to purchase, but something was killing it.We discussed what do consumers typically see. He told me that for every category he offers over 250 options and keeps adding new ones every week. I asked him to visualize from their point of view. Are you confusing them with more options?Four weeks later he sent an email saying he had cut his options by over 30% with absolutely no loss of sale but a massive saving in backend and inventory costs. He plans to cut down the options further and create unique paths for first-time and returning customers.He now intends to personalize the mailers, and create follow-up mailers with products that either complete an ensemble or contrast it for the consumers and is getting his tech backend ready to create customized mailers depending on his customers’ purchase pattern.Lesson: Get your analytics/intelligence team to put away their laptops, call in for some beer and sit and have a chat — not about what the data is showing, but to wonder what people could possibly be doing. Ask them to run a series of “what ifs” and create new train tracks. The results will surprise you.And yes, tell them to step out of their cubicles and go buy a coffee for customers (and non-customers) in the real world.There are hundreds of case-studies on how a small change to the call-to-action from green to red caused a massive jump in conversions. Scores of A/B studies (experiments with two variants) talk about the endless small tweaks that flipped consumers over from just browsing to buying.They are all true. Isn’t it obvious? The only thing between you and your customer is that tiny 4x5-inch mobile screen, that 12-inch laptop screen — each bit of that real estate and how you treat it matters.Colours, position, verbiage — every tiny cue matters. The success of Just a couple of quick examples on how these nuances matter:When I launched Moneycontrol.com, we realized that Indian consumers hated setting up portfolios on financial websites. Way back in 2001, we crafted a feature that would pre-populate a portfolio based on their search pattern (using cookies). That small tweak ensured that Moneycontrol has never been challenged as India’s premier financial site (despite minimal innovation for the last five years).I recall a debate with Bookmyshow.com’s Ashish Hemrajani and his team in 2007 (Network18 invested in the company). We decided to remove the pain of signing-in to buy a ticket. We asked why should we need a sign-in? Our job was simple: get the customer to his ticket with the least roadblocks. It’s a very small tweak and most of you wouldn’t have noticed it yet, but you keep coming back to Bookmyshow for its smooth transaction experience.Similarly, I see most travel sites don’t keep a record of my past booking history — that I usually book only direct flights (by the way, this hopping flight concept is not relevant to India; it originated in the US, where airlines fly hub-and-spoke), or that I always give priority to departure time versus hunting for the lowest fare. Yet these sites treat me like a brand-new customer and insist on showing me two-hop flights between Mumbai and Delhi from 2 am in the morning.It’s amazing that in this day and age, several websites and apps struggle to treat me differently from a new customer. If 100-odd ad-tech companies can know my usage pattern, why is your website still in the dark? Find a fix!If your customer acquisition cost (CAC) is not lower than your 6 or 12 month Lifetime Value (or LTV, the amount you earn from a customer over that period), you are likely to be toast.You are probably spending all the money, all over again, to get the customer back.If you do the math at your start-up, you will discover that you make money We spend all our money and effort on generating trial and not enough on the “follow through” — on the journey of converting trial users into heavy users.Light users look very rosy on VC presentations since they show up in the monthly active users and daily active users metrics, but they are harmful, as they suck away resources without ever converting to loyal customers.Split your audiences into the first timers, light users and heavy users. If you are able to shift just 5% of your light users to heavy, you can change the fortunes of your business. For instance, if 15% of your users are heavy users, that tiny 5% more can give a 33% jump in your revenues without adding to costs. That’s your leverage, right there.Many a start-up has died at this altar of widespread adoption but thin repeat usage; consumers come for the deals and leave you holding the lemon.There is a tipping point in the consumers’ behaviour when they convert from flirting users to heavy ones. Get obsessed with finding it.Don’t get carried away by the testimonials from Google Play Store or the reviews from your Facebook page. Wake up and smell the coffee — this is feedback from just 1 or 2 % of people who used your service and not from the 98% who never transacted.The silent majority votes with their feet; they just click away from your carefully designed website, your mouth-watering deals and don’t come back.If you don’t ask them, you’ll never know.You need to invest time and effort researching your non-users. Find a way to get into their head. We’ve been reacting to selling cues for thousands of years — it’s visceral. Observe saree salesmen at Delhi’s Karol Bagh market and you’ll see how they change their behaviour once they size up a new customer walking into the shop and ensure she leaves with more sarees than she ever intended to buy. That’s the way you win at your business.Often your team will be obsessed with adding features just because they think it’s clever. They forget that there is some poor consumer at the other end of that maze struggling to get your app to do something simple and doesn’t really need these fancy little features you have added. Empathize with him!Over-engineering is a crime. It’s just crazy to assume that consumers want more and more and more — don’t overwhelm them with choices and options.Example: Not a single e-commerce player has created a simple usage and buying guide for the millions of first-time consumers. There is no content to help people choose their TV sets or smartphones. The strategy seems to be to just overwhelm them with 250 models and bribe them with a discount. In five years most haven’t figured that their site can be a “favourite” place to shop if it actually helps consumers make a decision and not just blind them with options.How many e-tailers have tried to use the power of video that can crush the language barrier? Why are most e-commerce sites in English? Somehow they are willing to spend millions on discounts and Lesson: Don’t put your team in silos when it comes to consumer empathy. Have a regular “flow” meeting. Ask your entire team — tech, product, merchandising and sales support — to sit and figure how a consumer would react to each touch point.This meeting is more important than the one with the affiliate marketer at the cafe next door.There, I said it. Let’s admit that we Indians have been introduced to good design only in the last few years. We were not born into it, not seeped into it. We haven’t been reading London Tube maps for the last 50 years and haven’t seen great road and highway signage since birth.Try most of the packaging from Indian consumer companies and you’ll see what I mean. Some of them are sealed with such an intensity that you wonder if they ever wanted a consumer to unpack them. Only recently have we started seeing some innovation in packaging and design.We have a cultural heritage of art and aesthetic design, but not functional and simple design. Though I’ve worked with some of the best, the Great Indian Designer is a rarity. So if you have one, keep him — else find a way for your team to collaborate with the best in the world. Those are the best dollars you may spend. Like it or not, most Indian designers who will make the leap for you are still in high school.Some founders also forget the essential difference between a user interface designer and a user experience designer. They are not the same thing.They shouldn’t even be sitting together. One lives in the studio and the other should be out in the field with your customers.It doesn’t end with your website or app. It merely starts there. The end of every transaction is the beginning of a new, deeper relationship with the customer.It’s a fresh chance to reinforce your engagement, to take trust and the bond to another level. Every moment of delight you create matters. And this gives rise to a completely new set of cohorts for you to analyze.Cohort analysis is the fundamental underpinning of your business. It is the lie-detector test for whether your model works. It indicates, whether you set the right expectations, and whether you meet them. Are you creating productive, useful customer relationships?Good, solid cohorts are the indicator that your model is differentiated and sustainable.In other words, they are why you come to work.Remember, you are one cohort away from failureNow: Partner at India Value Fund + Active Angel Investor.

I applied to a couple of internships at mySidewalk (see Two) and both applications were more intense than the other positions I had applied for around the country. They required me to walk through what I would do on the job in order to access how IIf someone would have told me I would be writing for a tech start-up this summer, I would have quickly dismissed the idea. I spent months internship hunting, seeking a spots on political campaigns, lobbying, and in summer policy programs. Everything was anAfter the final round of interviews for the research internship, I got a call asking me to apply for the marketing position. It was a relief to take on more creative work after a semester of researching immigration in the European Union.Now I am thrilled to be writing every day, my team values my work, and I can’t wait to get better at it!My first couple of weeks did not feel very productive, but I learned a remarkable amount about marketing, sales stages, and data visualization that laid the foundation for the rest of my work. Through participating in brainstorming sessions and asking lots of questions, I received guidance and mentorship about which of my ideas worked, which were weak, and why.This taught me how to revise my ideas before I put them on the table, freeing my mentors up to do more of their own work, and increasing my value to the team.MySidewalk is a company of around 45 people, which feels massive to me, but in the grand scheme of things is probably very small. Everything we need to accomplish is taken care of internally in a wide open-office layout. That means I not only gained a broad understanding of how a start-up functions, Your internship should be about more than boosting your resume and tricking your company into hiring you, although that is a large part of it.Helping local leaders and city experts build better communities

După cum unii dintre voi știu, de mai bine de o lună am decis să “pivotez” în cariera mea și să mă dedic unui domeniu pe care-l abordasem oricum de ceva vreme: startup-urile și antreprenoriatul. Am vorbit cu zeci de tineri și antreprenori până acum și o voi face în continuare, în cadrul proiectului editorial Începând de astăzi, pe site, veți găsi povești ample ale antreprenorilor români de aici sau din străinătate. Nu-mi place doar să zgândăresc și să aflu doar părțile pozitive. Mai curând, mă interesează dramele, erorile sau eșecurile prin care trec fondatorii sau investitorii. Fără să fiu pompos, numai așa cred că vom deveni mai realiști și vom privi cum trebuie startup-urile românești.În cei patru ani de când sunt în presă am tradus zeci de mii de știri. A fost obositor și, de multe ori, futil. De aceea pe start-up.ro mă voi concentra pe materiale mari, originale, pe discuții cu fondatori, antreprenori sau investitori.De asemenea, în timp, vreau să devină locul unde se vor anunța cele mai noi tranzacții din piață. Calitate, înainte de cantitate, așa că în fiecare dimineață voi selecta un brief (FYI) cu cele mai interesante link-uri din presa internațională și locală, urmat de un story mai amplu.Acum ceva vreme spuneam că-mi place să fur, prin intermediul interviurilor pe care le fac, câte ceva de la fiecare om. O voi face în continuare.Let’s have some fun! Mă găsiți pe TinTag au obținut anul trecut 71.000 de dolari prin crowdfunding, pe Indiegogo.

Bu sene Startup Turkey’e cuma sabahı gittim, o nedenle perşembe günü özel oturumu ve girişimlerin yatırımcılara yaptığı pitch’leri kaçırdım. Cuma günü 22 girişimci/yatırımcı kartını vermiş (Artık kart taşımadığım için ben kart vermedim). 7–8 girişimci bana girişimini anlattı. Fikirlere yorum yapmıyorum dememe rağmen çok ısrar edenlere yorum yaptım. Tanıdıkları görmek iyi geldi, 2–3 kişiyle çok istememe rağmen buluşamadık çünkü otel bu sefer çok büyük ve bir gördüğünü bir daha görmek gerçekten zor. Yeni girişimimi bir kaç yerden haber beklediğim için public olarak açmadım ama üzerimdeki badge’de yazdığı için mecburen bayağı bir kişiye anlattım. (Hedef kitleme giren 4–5 kişiye kapalı beta için hesap da açtım az önce).Dakick’i beraber kurduğum ortaklarla (Ender ve Özgür), yeni bir projeyi tüm gün analiz ettik, tartışırken de bayağı eğlendik. Hatta bir ara sayısal lotoyu bile icad ettik, içkinin de etkisiyle. (Proje güzel, onu sağlam kafayla tartıştık) Eğer o projeyi de bir gün hayata geçirirsek diye hatırlamak için buraya da yazayım istedim ☺Yeni girişimimle ilgili de güzel gelişmeler oldu ama sonuçlansın, o zaman ayrıca yazarım.Gece feci içmişim, sanırım 1 şişe şarap, 4 kadeh single-malt viski, 3 tekila, 1 martini, 2 bira, bir de Ender’in ikramlarını içtim ama adlarını hatırlamıyorum. Cuma gecesi uyuduğumda sabah 4tü. Şunu farkettim, biz girişimciler daha çok biraraya gelmeli ve daha çok içmeliyiz, o kadar stresin üstüne arada eğlenmek iyi geliyor ☺Bu arada sürekli selamlaşmaktan, ayaküstü pitch’lerden yorulup bir ara herkesten gizlendim ☺ Etrafımda milyon dolar exit yapan bir sürü başarılı girişimci olmasına rağmen yine de üzerimde olması gerekenden çok fazla ilgi olması beni hala şaşırtmaya devam ediyor. Bu kadar ilgiyi hakedecek henüz süper bir başarım yok ama bir şekilde ön planda kaldım sanırım. Bunu söylediğimde de genelde “vay be adam üstelik alçak gönüllü” diyorlar. Bir ara benimle röportaj yapanlar oldu, tam o sırada “arkamda Selçuk Saraç var, onunla yapsanıza, adam hem süper başarılı, hem de bence 2015in en iyi melek yatırımcısı olma yolunda ilerliyor” dedim ama dinletemedim.Bu arada, beğendiğim girişimciler vardı, onlarla da sohbet ettim bol bol. Genel olarak gözlemim çoğu bıraktığım yerde kalmış, çok ilerleyememiş. Girişimcilere en büyük tavsiyelerimden birini söyleyim. “Eğer işler istediğiniz gibi gitmiyorsa major kararlar alın. Örneğin sürekli masa başında ürünle mi ilgileniyorsunuz, 1 ay ofise girmeyin, sahada dolaşın; Türkiye pazarı çok büyük değil diye mi düşünüyorsunuz, o zaman ürününüze çok güveniyorsanız ülke değiştirin.“ Zaten karar almakta zorlanıyorsanız, belki bir sonraki görüşümde de aynı yerde olacaksınız. Her gün büyük kararlar almaya alışın artık!Neyse çok konuştum, Burak Büyükdemir’e ve tüm Etohum ailesine sevgiler.Co-Founder of dakick.com (acquired by Turkcell) ; Author of “Dijital Girişimcilik Rehberi”  “Silikon Vadisi ve Girişimcilik”  “Dijital Girişimcilik 101”Gelecek aklında ilerle.

We failed yet another project! Why? Is it because we suck? Lack of experience? Wrong direction? Wrong motive? Why?All and none of the above at the same time.The main reason we had started this project We never realized what this project actually meant for people until we were too far along. We only thought it was a fun thing for the users. But before that a little story about our wrong motives.While watching Few months into the release of our app, we realized that people enjoyed putting their faces on actual characters a lot more than fruits. The problem was that we would have needed to deal with the copyright issues which we couldn’t carry through with our connections and budget. So the dream of acquiring wealth, going viral and becoming a success slowly faded away for this project. Thus we moved on.Why did people love putting their faces on characters? We never asked this question. What it meant for them and why they wanted to do it… It is however very clear to me now, and was namely because it defined who they really were. What their goals, their dreams were. They wanted to be closer to their ideal self, their motivations, their beliefs, their inspirations.That is why my profile picture is of Ash Ketchum with my face on, and previously as a fruit with my face on it for 6 months. Because those pictures defined me more than any other picture taken in the whole world. With the capsicum face I wanted to reflect the unique, strange side of my personality (no one else had a profile pic like that) and with Ash Ketchum, my goals, my dreams and my attitude.For our startup, this should have been the motivation. We should have tried to help people express themselves, show their emotions, their desires, their passions with the help of their beloved characters. Help people get closer to their ideal selves just a little bit more, make their friends and family see them as who they really are. But we didn’t do it for these reasons, we did not have a compelling reason to solve this problem and when it didn’t suddenly take off, we gave up. Nevertheless we had learned our lesson and have started another startup but for the right reasons this time. Thus we are Oddly enough, over 90% of We have therefore resolved to We believe that this is what matters the most.What is it that we want to do?We used to think that startups were about doing something great, getting investments, lots of PR, going viral, growing big, changing the world.But we now see that it is just doing something you want and with a little bit of luck it turns out to be what everyone is looking for.So ask yourself, are you doing something you really want?Entrepreneur, geek

Geçtiğimiz salı günü destekçim BKM’nin katkılarıyla yeni girişimimi Öncelikle geliştirmeye 2 Aralık 2014te başladık. MVP’imizi 18 Aralık’ta açtık. Hatta ilk üyelerimiz Bu girişimim yarı sosyal girişim. Girişim ekosisteminin gelişimine katkıda bulunacak farklı bir girişim. O yüzden yarı ticari bir oluşum desek daha doğru olacak. Bu nedenledir ki tüm ekosistem paydaşlarının bu platformu desteklemesini arzuluyorum.Startups.watch’u Platform bir veritabanı gibi gözükse de dinamik metriklerle analiz yapılmasını kolaylaştıran bir analiz platformu.Hatta yakında IP temelli girişimlerin detay raporlarını da platforma dahil etme ihtimalimiz var. Yani özetle startups.watch webrazzi veritabanı gibi bir yapı değil. Onlarla kardeşiz. Biz işin analiz kısmındayız, dinamik verilerle anlık analizler sunuyoruz.Hedef kitlemizi öncelik sırasına göre şu şekilde planladık:Gelelim ilk haftaya. Ilk haftamız düşündüğümden çok daha yoğun geçti. UI hatalarımızı düzelttik, bazı istekleri yaptık. 1 hafta bittiğinde 1. ay hedefimizi tutturduk. 5. sıradaki hedef kitlemiz düşündüğümden fazla paket aldı. O yüzden biraz onlara verdiğimiz faydaları tekrar gözden geçirmeye ve onları ürünü bırakmak istemeyecekleri hale nasıl götürürüzü düşünmeye başladık. Fiyat politikamızı da en çok 5 numaralı hedef kitle eleştirdi fakat ayda 8.25 dolara geldiğini iyi vurgulayamadığımızdan öyle düşündüklerini düşünüyorum. Gerçi en çok da onlar paket aldı :)Önümüzdeki dönem girişimcilerle, hızlandırma programları ile teknoparklarla daha içli dışlı olacağız. Oradaki verilerin düzenli olarak yatırımcıların önüne düşmesi için bir mekanizma oturtmaya çalışacağız. Yapılacaklar listemizde şu anda 35 madde var. Onları da yaptıkça daha da iyiye gideceğiz. İleride bazı sürprizlerimiz de olacak, sektörün analiz kaynağı olmak için üyelerimizi veriye ve analize boğacağız (iyi anlamda).Şimdilik bu kadar.

Over a year ago, on a sleepless night, I sat down and recounted all that has happened since I started and shut down my startup. All that happened over 2 years played out in a blink of an eye.Then goblins in my head worked its magic and started jotting down all that i had learned while building my startup. This post is a result of that.The best way to get over something is to turn it into literature. I might be correct on few things. I might be wrong on many things. I might even be crazy.

나는 스타트업의 가장 큰 의미는, 누구나 자기 스스로의 노력으로 세습에 의하지 않고도 큰 부를 창출할 수 있다는 가능성을 보여 줌으로써 사회 계층 구조에 역동성을 주고 각 개인들에게 동기부여를 하는 것이라고 본다.스타트업이라는게 각 개인이 돈을 벌어야겠다는 동기에 의하여 간접적으로 사회적인 변화를 가져 올 수도 있겠지만, 그 외에 스타트업을 잘 해야만 하는 사회적 의미는 무엇일까?나는 아래의 세 가지가 스타트업이 가지는 사회적인 의미라고 본다지금 우리 주위를 둘러 보면, 생활이 깊숙히 파고든 상품, 서비스 중 많은 것들이 혁신적인 새로운 기술에 의해 만들어진 것이고, 그 제품은 스타트업이 만들어 낸 혁신적인 기술에 의한 것들이 대부분이다.우리가 늘 들고 다니는 핸드폰만 해도, CPU를 양분하는 ARM과 퀄컴, OS를 양분하는 안드로이드와 iOS의 애플, 내장 플래시 메모리의 인텔, 모두 스타트업으로 시작한 기업들이다. 물론 이들 외에도 수백개의 스타트업들이 만들어낸 부품과 소프트웨어로 이 핸드폰이 가득 차 있다.또, 우리의 일상에서 온라인 라이프의 대부분을 담당하고 있는 네이버 (미국의 경우는 구글), 온라인 친구 관계를 책임지는 페이스북 (예전 국내의 싸이월드), 쇼핑을 책임지는 옥션과 지마켓 (미국의 경우는 아마존과 이베이), 역시 모두 스타트업 출신이다.매일 매일의 업무와 일상 생활에서 없는 것을 이제는 상상할 수 없는 PC를 가능하게 한 인텔과 마이크로소프트, IBM이 PC의 시대를 열기 전 PC의 시작을 알린 애플이 대표적 실리콘밸리의 스타트업이었다. 시간을 좀 더 거슬러 올라 가면, 지금은 모두 실패한 핸드폰 메이커로 알고 있지만 한때 인텔과 CPU 시장을 양분하여 패권을 다투었던 모토롤라, 이들 모든 반도체 업체의 원조 좀 더 시야를 확대해 보면, 20세기 초반 자동차의 보편화에 결정적 역할을 한 포드 자동차, 에디슨이 자신이 발명한 전구를 판매하기 위하여 설립한 GE, 자신이 발명한 전신 및 전화 서비스를 보급하기 위하여 그라함 벨이 설립한 벨 전화회사까지도, 당시의 기준에서 보자면 스타트업이었다.즉, 우리 생활에 변화를 가져 온 혁신적인 기술과 제품의 대부분은 사실상 스타트업 기업들이 만들어서 상용화한 것이고 이들 스타트업이 없었다면 이러한 혁신은 거의 가능하지 않았을 것이다.이 것이 스타트업이 우리 사회에 미치는 가장 중요한 영향이라고 생각한다.이를 Andressen Horowitz의 파트너 Benedict Evans는 이렇게 표현하였다.이러한 혁신은 우리 생활 방식을 바꾸었을 뿐 아니라, 그 기업들 자체도 많은 경제적 가치를 창출해 냈다.아직도 스타트업이라고 하면 우리는 ‘뛰어난 기술을 가지고 재미있는 제품을 만드는 원더키드 (wonder kid)’라는 이미지를 가지고 있다.하지만, 실제 데이터를 살펴 보면 경제에서 상당히 많은 비중을 스타트업 출신 기업들이 차지하고 있다. 즉, 단순히 재미있는 제품을 만들어 내는 것에 그치지 않고 그를 기반으로 상당한 경제적 가치를 만들어 냈다.이에 대한 별도의 연구 결과를 찾기 어려워서 아주 간단한 분석을 해 보았다..Nasdaq는 전 세계의 혁신적인 기업들이 모인 미국에서 두 번째 큰 주식 시장으로서 글로벌 스타트업을 상징하는 대표적인 주식 시장이다. 이 시장에서 스타트업 출신 기업이 차지하는 비중을 계산해 보았다. Nasdaq에 리스팅된 기업들을 시가 총액 순서로 1위에서 100위까지의 기업을 나열하고, 그 중에서 VC의 투자를 받은 적이 있는 기업들을 스타트업 출신 기업이라고 판단하고 그들 기업의 가치를 계산해 보았다.2015년 4월 21일 기준, 이들 Nasdaq 100대 기업 중 스타트업 출신 기업의 시가 총액의 합은 3조 7,100억 달러로서, Nasdaq 100대 기업 시가 총액의 합 5조8,500억 달러의 63.5%, Nasdaq 전체 시가 총액의 합 8조5,000억 달러의 43.5%에 달하고 있다.단순히 총액의 합뿐 아니라 시가 총액 기준 Top 10 기업 중 8개, Top 20 기업 중 13개가 스타트업 출신으로서, 스타트업은 ‘아직 기업 규모가 작은 wonderkid들의 기업’이라는 이미지와는 달리 Nasdaq 시장에서 가장 큰 기업들의 대부분이 스타트업 출신이다.과연 미국만 그럴까? 한국의 대표적인 IT 기업 두 곳을 비교해 보자.KT는 명실상부한 대표 IT 기업이다. 하지만, 그 이는 2000년 전후의 인터넷 혁명에서 1위 기업이 된 네이버가 라인 메신저의 성공에 힘입어 지금의 ‘모바일 혁명’의 흐름에서도 큰 미래 가치를 창출해 낼 수 있다는 기대가 반영된 것이다. 1천만대 규모의 PC 기반 인터넷 혁명에서 10조에 가까운 기업 가치를 창출해낸 네이버가, 그 단위가 수억, 수십억대에 이를 모바일 기반 혁명에서도 이 추세를 유지할 수 있다면 그 창출될 가치의 규모는 지금 상상하기 어려운 규모가 될 것이다.아직도 스타트업이 ‘재미있는 기술을 가진 wonder kids의 작은 기업’으로 보이는가?이미 스타트업은 글로벌 시장이나 국내 모두 상당한 경제적 가치를 창출하는 주체가 된지 오래이다.아울러 스타트업의 경제적 가치를 평가하는데 많이 언급되지 않는 것의 하나가, 스타트업이 질 높은 일자리를 창출하는데 기존 대기업보다 훨씬 큰 역할을 한다는 점이다.대기업은 대규모 설비 투자 중심의 제조업 아니면 일자리 창출 효과가 크지 않은 금융업 중심으로서, 이들의 낙수 효과 (trickle-down effect)에 의하여 새로운 일자리가 만들어진다고 하더라도 그 대부분은 저 임금의 서비스업의 일자리를 주로 만들어 내는 것에 비하여, 혁신적인 기술 기반의 스타트업들은 그보다 높은 퀄리티의 일자리를 훨씬 더 많이 창출해 내고 있다.이렇듯 스타트업은 기술 기반의 혁신, 이를 통한 경제적 가치의 창출 및 이를 기반으로 한 퀄리티 높은 일자리의 창출 등 자체의 존재 이유 외에도 사회적으로 큰 혁할을 하고 있다.이러한 점들이 스타트업이 가지는 사회적인 의미라고 본다.이전 이야기:다음 이야기:Entrepreneur-turned venture capitalist @ Translink Capital Korea

August 2015’s public market volatility seemingly spurred new creatures in Silicon Valley’s ever-weirder lexicon. Brad Feld highlighted the This week, Tomasz Tunguz, my favorite VC blogger, set One of the biggest perks of business school is access to great speakers. Two weeks ago, Howard Marks interviewed Between 1981 and 2010, Druckenmiller generated returns close to 30% annually for his investors in Duquesne Capital. More impressively, he never lost money on an annual basis. Yet, what’s most intriguing is Druckenmiller’s approach. Instead of relying on typically cited top down macroeconomic indicators like GDP, employment statistics, and wage growth to evaluate the economy, Stanley used bottom-up leading indicators such as changes in credit spreads or divergences in stock verticals (especially retail and housing) to understand where the market was headed. These indications, based in changes in underlying asset classes, are called market action. Studying the changes in market action is what enabled Stanley to identify and profit enormously in both the 2000 Tech Crash and 2008 Housing Bubble.Bear with me for a quick technical sidebar. JDruckenmiller and Hussman’s idea of market action is not restricted to public markets. On the contrary, the connection between market action and valuation is Keeping in mind the idea of market action, let’s look at the state of Silicon Valley. Mattermark’s Yet, odd market action is not limited to the Late Stage. Strange things are happening in Early Stage investing as well. While Seed/Pre-A investments were down 47% from 2014, record amounts of money are coming onto sites like AngelList. Just this week, AngelList announced a $400MM IPOs (aka “the new down round”) tell a similarly confounding story. Comparing IPO volume to the number of private market companies with “public level” valuations indicates another divergence in market internals. 2014 saw 275 IPOs in the USA, raising collectively close to $90B. Yet in Q1’15, the same quarter the SP500 first broke $2,100.00, US IPO volume dropped to just 34 companies raising $5B, an amount smaller than any quarter in 2013 or 2014. Through October 2015, there have been 147 IPOs, which is approximately 64% of the same YTD 2014 amount. Yet, on the private markets, With all this divergence, what’s going on? Some of this inevitably stems from the current ultra-low interest rate environment. The lack of yield available to investors has pushed unfamiliar money into private tech markets. Marc Andreessen’s recent “The key takeaway about market action is that it conveys a change in sentiment. It doesn’t in-and-of-itself signal a bubble, but instead reflects the underlying risk-appetite investors are displaying. When ultra-high valuations meet diverging market action, things have a tendency to fall apart quickly. I believe this is what is driving many of the large Late Stage rounds. Smart money is preparing for a less friendly economic period, and padding private balance sheets to survive the winter.No Silicon Valley “Boom or Bust” story is complete without an animal these days, so to conclude I bring you the “Bear”. Bears are incredible animals. They eat everything from honey to walruses. They can run nearly as fast as a Thoroughbred and swim in open ocean for 100 miles. When rookie investors leave food on the table at the campsite, bears join the picnic. However, when winter comes and the free food dries up, bears can hibernate for months at a time to endure brutal winter conditions.Unlike the Unicorn, which requires a fictitious story to exist, the Bear is unconcerned with the prevailing sentiment and economic conditions. It is practical, has great unit economics, runs a minimal burn, adheres to a long-term vision, places the customer first, and avoids solving mythical problems. Amazon is a model Bear. It lost 90% of its value after the Tech Crash, only to build it back nearly 100x. Today it continues investing every dollar of operating cash flow to build a long-term business that can still, two decades later, provide shareholders multiples on their investment.It’s not coincidental Bears thrive through and out of Bear market cycles. They are companies learn to forage for talent, hunt for sales and dollars, and survive on limited resources when things are not plentiful. Unlike Unicorns, Bears are real. With valuations sky-high and market action in Startupland degrading, we will likely soon see who is a Unicorn and who is a Bear.We’re a different kind of venture fund run by students, for students.

Technical Debt is viewed and described in many different ways. Its purpose can vary company-to-company, product-to-product. The real key to tech debt however, is the handling of it — and that’s where we want to focus our thoughts today.First, though — Let’s simplify it:Many see tech debt as a necessary evil. Building out perfect software on scalable code takes a significant amount of time. If the product being built is unproven, the best option is often to get a minimum viable product built, test the market, gather feedback and iterate. If a company invests the time into perfect code for initial product release only to find out there’s no product market fit; that is a costly loss.Imagine, for instance, you have to run a quick product test to see if your users are interested in a new feature. One way to code it up would be adding a simple ‘IF’ statement into your main controller. This would add complexity to your code and thus, technical debt. The proper solution would be to add a new class or helper that would allow configuration and be expandable to other tests (you could even implement this in a way where you could clean up some existing logic).The first solution (the ‘IF’ statement) would be a quick 5-minute hack, while the proper fix could lead to five hours of refactoring — a significant difference in time usage. It comes down to prioritizing product release over perfect code.It’s termed “debt” due to the fact that at some point, those “hacks” will need to be repaired or even rebuilt completely. These rebuilds may take longer than if the software were built properly from the beginning. In essence, you’re paying interest.That brings us to the oft-made, and obvious, comparison to financial debt. For simplicity purposes it makes sense. Take on debt, be it technical or financial, in order to gain immediate access to something. Without taking on the debt, one may never attain the desired object — a car, student loan, or version 1.0 of a mobile app.Sure, technical debt can absolutely cost a company more money in the long run, but if managed properly, tech debt can also be a key asset in helping an early-stage startup grow.If a CTO chooses to add technical debt to the code base in order to run a quick feature test or to help land a new client, it should be done with the full knowledge of their business counterparts along with the acceptance that this feature, if successful, will need an extra 5 hours or more of coding down the road to refactor (pay off the debt). If the experiment fails, there should also be the willingness to clean up and remove the hack. Failing to clean up will leave the code cluttered and messy, causing additional coding problems in the future.Technical debt, first and foremost, is a means to an end. It’s a step in the process of attaining a goal, hitting a milestone, or more, getting a product to market. Tech debt is a cost of doing business. Like any expense, though, it needs to be managed.How does one manage it?Tech debt is not a new phenomenon. CTO’s, Engineers and technical teams have been working around it for years. Everyone has their own method of tracking hacks and ensuring they don’t cause too much damage — or interest. Some solutions are more scientific or complex than others.Properly communicating and tracking the technical debt in your code base, leads to healthy conversation between sales, marketing and business folks. It’s better to have full visibility into the debt and inform the business team when too much is accrued.We created We built Bliss because we feel strongly about the benefits tech debt can bring to an early-stage company if managed properly between both the non-technical leadership and the technical team.However, the important point is whatever method a company chooses to manage their technical debt, the important thing is to remain aware of it and understand some code may need refactoring. Be prepared to track and publish your numbers internally — when you don’t measure and make something visible it is impossible to make the right decisions.We have found that for early-stage companies a good base for your tech debt is It’s difficult to put a metric around the opportunity cost of not getting to market early (due to spending time building the perfect code). The reality, however, is no product will ever be perfect or final in its first release. Changes will be made, iteration will happen.By accruing technical debt a startup is able to play in the middle ground — build a product functional and aesthetic enough to test the market, but release it in a manner that does not burn through the company’s operating budget before getting off the ground.The key takeaway from this is understanding that technical debt, in most cases, is a necessary evil — a means to an end. The refactoring, or extra work, on the back-end is worth it because taking on the tech debt allowed you to hit key milestones and release dates at a pace otherwise unattainable.CEO of 

Each of us who starts up, some of us are first time entrepreneurs; in fact most are firs-timers in Indian ecosystem. We are fine at the start with 2 co-founder sketching an idea to start and some early proof in establishing that there is a market. We go on to expand the team and growth picks up with let’s say 5 people team. Everybody is happy and we think we know the trade. This is where we start our own ‘growth’ limitations. And this happens to most when we are mostly at Pre-Series A or at Angel funding stage. This is the stage where 80% of startup dies a brutal death.I walked to a fellow CEO’s office to understand how he runs his business. Some super learning and practicals on how he has grown his company 9x in less than 6 months.I thought to jot down this blog post as part of #PayItForward sharing philosophies. Here are five things that you must do to expand capabilities and grow +vely.There is no excuse that you don’t need a mentor. Don’t expect your mentor to say yes for everything. Don’t expect mentor to be your sales man. Use your mentor for insights on certain part of the business, specifically growth (I’m assuming your mentor is an entrepreneur — been there, done that and failed/succeeded in his/her endeavour).Just not money but smart mind gives your investment an instant return. Establish an active board with your investor board members participating regularly. Without this, you are going nowhere! With this, it doesn’t guarantee success but you definitely gain more insights on growth.Oh yes! Go out to drink coffee and meet people in Startup ecosystem. Do some #PayItForward type participation in helping other Staruppers. There is lot to learn from others.You need a ‘peer’ network which could be an independent ‘sounding board’, informally. Though you have mentors, advisors, investors who are super in sharing their time for biz. However, to keep in touch with ground realities, such peer network is the way forward. This peer network is huge as you gain lot of practices they use in their organization.Meet other founders  CEOs. Ask them to walk you through how they execute their growth.CEO  Co-founder 

As I write this I am currently in the air transiting back from Aruba where I spoke at the ATECH conference and now on my way to Turkey for the G20 Youth Entrepreneur Summit. In the next four months I will be in and out of Vancouver travelling to San Francisco, Toronto, Mexico, New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and potentially a trip out to Colombia and Brazil. Through it all Vancouver is and will always be my central hub.Locally back in Vancouver, sparks flew when Compass revealed that Vancouver dropped from #9 to #18 on the Luckily, our very own Alex Chuang — Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Launch Academy dissected the report in While many of these findings may suggest startups have a greater chance of survival outside of Vancouver, here are some reasons why I think I can speak for all three of us (Manny, Shafin and myself) — we’ve all had opportunities to live and work in different parts of the world, but we’ve all come back to Vancouver in certain respects to build businesses here because for us, this is home. All three of us are in love with this city, our community, and our ecosystem here in Vancouver. Vancouver is such a diverse ecosystem in terms of ethnicity, geography, and demographics — it really makes a compelling place to build businesses that could have international appeal. With our focus being international, being in a place like Vancouver gives us the foundational outreach into different communities and geographical locations.While Silicon Valley ranked #1 and Seattle at #8 on the Global Startup Ecosystem Ranking, the benefit of operating in Vancouver is same time zone and its close proximity to these key ecosystems which helps drive channel partners to Vancouver. We saw this with the success of the With the development of the Asia-Pacific Gateway and Corridor underway, being in Vancouver will allow us to leverage our potential expansion out into Asia. We’re also looking into expanding in Latin America and Europe, but all these communities have an affinity for Vancouver, so for us to sell them on coming here or working with partners in Vancouver isn’t that difficult. These overseas partners are also cognizant of the relationships and inroads we have into Seattle and Silicon Valley. For them coming into Canada as opposed to directly into the US is a bonus as Vancouver can act as a safe landing pad for them to utilize as an entry point into the North American market. Similar to how Singapore acts as a safe landing pad as an entry point into the Asian market.Based on our experiences on building businesses in Canada (specifically in British Columbia and Ontario), we’ve leveraged the benefits of the tax credits, access to government grants, and getting affordable (and loyal) tech talent. To compare, the average salary of devs in Silicon Valley is $118K for a software engineer versus the $51.6K in Vancouver.With regards to government funding options and other non-dilutive financing programs, manage your time wisely. Ensure your company has reached product market fit and customer validation prior to exploring programs such as SRED and IRAP. Government grants and tax credit programs require quite a rigorous documentation and reporting process — which you must be on top of from day one of starting your company. Maximize your highly valuable time by focusing on what is most important at the early stages: talking to customers.While Vancouver has many other benefits on starting a business, keep in mind that once you are ready to scale and grow that business, you will need to look for opportunities and channel partners outside of Vancouver (especially if your customer base is outside of Vancouver).For Victory Square, our vast network gives us the visibility and connections our portfolio companies need when expansion is on the horizon. Having a presence for business development and marketing purposes in San Francisco and other international cities is critical to the development of our companies. But as far as headquarters goes, Vancouver is our home.Investor/Entrepreneur  Co-Founder/CEO of 

“Nobody is allowed to say ‘easy,’ ‘fast,’ or ‘simple.’”My marketing manager Katie brandished a purple marker, indicating that I was to shut up. We were having an all-team meeting about brand direction, and she hamstrung us where we sat, 5 minutes into the meeting. Expense management is a crowded space. And that’s why we entered it. Usually when a technology space is crowded it’s because no one has found a I want Being a small team, our process is based around conversation. Usually our best ideas start as a joke. By the time we’ve distilled that concept into a working element, we’d edited out the humor that had attracted us to the idea in the first place. A lot of this came down to us not trusting ourselves in this stuffy arena. We’re a team of smart-alec-y goofs in a suit-world. But maybe, we thought, that could work to our advantage. The closest any of our competition has come to being playful is Expensify using “suck” in their tagline. Having collected that evidence, and spent some serious time thinking of how we could make our app more uniquely enjoyable, we came up with a few things that we’re going to focus on as we go on our journey of brand-discovery.Enterprise design is SO BORING. Why?! It’s as though a company hits a certain number of users and RUNS to the Enterprise-Internet salon for a makeover, emerging resplendent in muted tones of grey and dark blue. It’s like watching what was once an interesting, edgy candidate go through presidential bootcamp.There’s been a lot of talk about A/B testing designs, and touting the inherent conversion rates. Great products evoke an emotional response. We turn to products because they solve a problem, yes, but also because they bring us a modicum of joy. “Whimsy” was one of the keywords we came up with during our session. We like it because it grants us permission to try stuff out, make silly jokes, and occasionally make you double-take. Just as design gets muted, tone of voice gets super pandering. Gone are their playful tones and cheeky tweets: instead, their copy is cool and indulgent, and promises to “be in touch.” It’s a narrative equivalent of soylent. Nutritious, but bland: without heart… without playfulness.We turned into a bunch of future-ists during our chat about branding. We didn’t just focus on who we want to be, we talked about how we want to grow up. When we consider the future of expense management, we see it becoming an extremely automated experience. Excited about tech, travel and family. CEO 

In the startup scene there is a lot of discussion around company culture, however there seems to be more focus on the superficial, observable elements of organizational culture, rather than its core, a company’s ethos and ethics. A culture without ethos is but an empty shell, a soulless body. Ethos is the heart of every culture and you should protect it at all cost. Ethos is character, authenticity and integrity. Ethos is the good name that as a magnet attracts great people and ensures longevity. Business ethics are also crucial to a company’s survival, if you don’t act ethically, you cannot have ethos.Ethos is the character, spirit and moral compass of a person, organization or movement and therefore determines one’s credibility, trustworthiness and authority. Ethos is in essence what gives you a good name. A startup’s ethos derives from the ethos of the founder of a company or its CEO and develops constantly throughout a company’s lifetime. Key to ethos is integrity and can only be sustained through constant self-examination, as it may change in response to new ideas or as your organizational structure changes. As your team grows you need to foster a shared ethos and ensure you add people that their ethos is in line with the company ethos. If teamwork is one the core characteristics of your team, but you keep hiring antagonistic, imperious personalities you’ll end up with a very different company, as in the words of Aristotle, you are what you repeatedly do. In the words of Business models, product development and funding can only get you that far. At the end of the day, at the core of business, are human relationships, relationships with your employees, customers and investors, and successful relationships demand ethos, authenticity and respect.To determine your company’s ethos you need to consider what characteristics you’d want people to associate with your brand and how your management and employees should address hypothetical dilemmas that call for trade offs between profits, customer experience, and ethically questionable practices.Ethos is also the origin of the word ethics. Ethos and ethics are intertwined, ethics derive from ethos, but you also can’t have ethos if you don’t behave ethically. Business ethics is the analysis and reasoned reaction to any business situation, from deciding the promotion of an employee, to releasing a product to market and Culture on the other hand is but the expression of your company’s ethos, the traditions, habits, beliefs and ways of communication. According to At a startup organizational culture, both observable and core, stem from the founding team’s ethos, incentives and relationship between its members. As the company grows, the founding team instills its work ethos to employees leading by example, rewarding ethical behavior and setting traditions consistent with its values, in short via building an authentic culture with a strong core consistent to the company’s values.In Google has influenced a lot of startups in shaping their culture and publicly shares its Entrepreneurship is a journey, ethos is your compass, ethics represent the decisions you make trying to stay on course, while culture represents the day to day life on board. Like Odysseus you will face tons of temptations, conflicts and hardships, not only at sea but also on board and at home.The sum of all this is what makes or breaks a company, it drives decisions, attracts and retains talent, and dictates the prioritization of a company’s resources and conflict management. It’s what makes a brand authentic and attracts loyal customers.It is easy to build a false identity and company culture that isn’t authentic, but derives from the overall current entrepreneurial culture of the startup ecosystem, however, although popular, this may not be sustainable. In many cases the observable culture seems to overshadow the core one, and is disconnected from the company values, that are left still and dusty on a wall.Startups move at such a fast pace that it’s sometimes easy to go with the motions, forget to reassess their culture and ethical behavior or simply try to fit in the overall vibe of their ecosystem.Let’s take a look at four common traps relevant to culture and ethics startups fall into.Perhaps the most well known, human, customer centric culture in the startup community is This happiness/positivity centric philosophy, along with the view Focusing on happiness as an end goal though, can be In his article “As Leo Widrich, co-founder of Buffer, says there is a difference between being positive and sweeping anything negative unders the carpet. He A day doesn’t go by without seeing in my Facebook newsfeed some entrepreneur sharing a quote about the heroic nature of entrepreneurs, which is a great confidence booster I guess, through the ups and downs of building a company, but there is a thin line between being confident and being condescending.There is a lot of talk about whether entrepreneurs are born or made, but either way the fact that someone is different doesn’t mean they are superior. Do entrepreneurs naturally have stronger narcissistic tendencies and higher chances of suffering from delusion of grandeur? In case you are wondering about both your entrepreneurial potential and your psychopathic tendencies this Startup universe has its own mythology, Gods and heroes, like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Peter Thiel, and is aligned on a single mission to make the world a better place. When entrepreneurs portray themselves as the rebels that broke the chains of a monthly wage, the lions that rose from the sheep, I cannot help but wonder though, how do they think that appeals to the rest of the “sheep” that they’ll try to hire for a monthly wage? If you want to attract talented entrepreneurial people to your company, remember that they want to work with people, not work for people. A great entrepreneur without good employees is like a great idea without execution.Hiring to cultural fit is a very popular practice — recent survey found that more thanSubjective criteria, like likability, common interests and gut feeling may trick you into hiring a fit to the observable culture, to your company’s A false use of cultural fit may not only lead to a less diverse and Let’s rethink what cultural fit means in the Technological advancements have always had a strong impact in society, and the revolution in communications in the past few years has However startup community seems It is telling, perhaps, that the majority of startup related exposé in the recent years, like Ethical culture and positive social sentiment cannot be built overnight as you approach an IPO, it needs to be embedded at the core of your business. Founders should consider that the way they face their ethical social responsibilities trickles down the company culture and in the ways their employees will identify and respond to ethical issues as well. In order to respond to an ethical issue, employees should first be able to identify it and have a clear decision making process at hand. Diversity in the workplace can A solid ethical reputation not only results in greater employee commitment, satisfaction and therefore efficiency, but also leads to increased partnership opportunities as well as customer and investor trust.Brad Feld has written a great post on the illusion that you can achieve Information and Communication Systems Engineer, fashion/tech/luxury consultant // founder WINLea // VC //@LCFLondon// 

by By now it’s fairly common knowledge that the failure rate of startups is extremely high. Today, approximately one out of ten startups actually succeed. The bigger question is why do so many startups fail?Often it’s due to the very first step — the most crucial, and most avoidable step — in the startup journey.The light bulb goes off. You just had an idea for the next great app, software or product that is going to solve a tremendous need. How can this not exist yet? Surely the guys at Shark Tank will bite on this one. After all you’ve evaluated the market landscape, growth potential, competitors, opportunities, and validated current assumptions about your potential customers’ pain points and needs. Right?Well…chances are, probably not. This is all too common. In fact, Fortune reported Why do so many entrepreneurs fail to see if their assumptions are right?Turns out this is an extremely challenging process to go through, especially when most startups are solo operations or very lean teams. The resources simply aren’t there. But going through the process can mean the difference between going into extreme debt and retiring early on a beach somewhere in the South of France.What can you do to be a part of the 10% that succeeds?Many entrepreneurs approach a new business venture assuming their assumptions about the market or customer needs are correct. But what if these are incorrect? What if you create something nobody wants? Or worse, could you be leaving an even bigger opportunity on the table?You have to confirm your assumptions otherwise you could be overlooking larger problems or better solutions you could be pursuing.The single most important thing you can do as a startup is identify the “white space.”Simply put, white space represents market opportunity. Broken down, this is where you zero in on where you can attack a market — how you can offer a product that is highly differentiated from anything else out there, and sufficiently fulfill a real need, desire or pain point. Think of it as gaining market intelligence. To find the white space, there are some essential questions that need to be answered. A few include:Let’s take a quick jaunt down memory lane. Did you ever play in the sandbox when you were a kid? If so, think about how you typically approached the sandbox. Often you’d go in with an idea of what you wanted to create — maybe a massive castle with a moat, a humble village, or maybe a statue of your favorite cartoon character.Once in the sandbox, however, this plan might shift based on tools available to you, what your friends were building, whether the sand was wet or dry, and the list goes on. You took a few minutes to gain intel and pivoted from there. This helped ensure you didn’t waste precious recess time simply pushing sand around.Building a successful business requires the same approach — gaining market intelligence to validate whether or not an opportunity exists, then developing a strategy before you spend your time, money and resources building it.Remember, building a business on just an idea, is the worst idea.We help innovative people transform great ideas into great businesses through design, user validation, development, branding, and customer acquisition.

Not everyone should start a startup. Most people aren’t cut out for building and leading high growth companies. But, in Europe, there are still a large number of people who could be founders, but who don’t realise what’s possible, or how to go about building a startup.A common reason cited by young technologists for not yet starting a startup is that “I want to learn about business before I build my own startup”. Often this means going to work at a big company for a couple of years.This is a common misconception — that a big company will teach you how to build a startup. A big company is not a super sized version of a startup.Although the word startup has now been appropriated to mean ‘any new small business’, a startup is a company that is bringing an unknown product, to an unknown customer using an unknown business model. They aren’t using tried and tested methods. This means that building a startup is an inherently creative process. It’s about exploration, testing and discovery.Big companies have a known product, being sold to a known customer using a known business model. This means that instead of a creative process, working in a big company is all about optimisation. It’s about selling more, for cheaper, potentially in new markets.In the very early days of building a startup, we have seen founders with big company backgrounds struggle. They are looking for answers that will allow them to begin optimising their processes, before they even know what they are selling or to whom. This leads to the biggest mistake that a startup can make — building something that people don’t want.So before you think of going to develop your ‘business experience’ think about why you are doing this — because it’s not to help you build a startup. Are you We have worked with a wide range of founders from straight out of uni (sometimes pre-uni) through to leaving ten years in a career. And there are some benefits to starting up young. Naivety about the status quo can be a benefit. I have never heard a graduate founder worry about procurement processes, for example. It’s not that procurement processes aren’t a problem, but if you don’t even know about them it means you can take a creative approach to selling, rather than following an existing (and probably broken) process.[You can read more about the differences i’ve seen between mature founders and grad founders The skills needed to start a startup are very peculiar to being a founder. And the best way to learn these skills is to become a founder. There is no way to learn the skills you need before you start — no course or hackathon is going to teach you what it’s actually like. If you want to build a company, then ask yourself why you haven’t already.It’s likely that you’re just making excuses.Co-founder of EF (Thoughts from the EF team

Before they give you money, VCs want to know that you’ve not only created something great, but that you’ve got the competence, foresight, and flexibility to build your big idea into an actual game changer. Meanwhile, potential users want to know that you’re not just another app but actually have their best interests in mind.Whether you’re looking for funding, users, or both, you have to sell people with your startup pitch.

I remember lying on the floor of my living room in the fetal position when my first startup was finally put to rest. I was 26 and it felt like I’d lost my only child. I feel your pain.However, that does not, in any way whatsoever, excuse the way you handled this. You go on Kudos for your achievements (this is not the right forum to highlight them by the way). But right now, the only thing you might consider communicating is how badly you fucked up at crisis communication (to say the least) and how you’re making it up to your stakeholders. PandoDaily has some questions for you.Best of luck with the road ahead.

I am an advisor to We needed a place to organize tasks. Trello allows team members to be assigned tasks and see what the company is working on. We have a big push on getting users on our platform, internally it is a top task. We assign task priorities with different label’s with their importance. Red for “High Priority”, orange for “Medium Priority”, and green for “Low Priority”. Now you can remove the noise by filtering for just the important tasks or specific to you as an individual. Also, we can assign due dates for the people who need deadlines. This is a critically important tool, in my operational role.Slack helps us define and maintain our company culture. We have fun in several different channels and keep the conversations light. These channels are our version of the “water cooler” conversations that any member can take part in. It is also our main system for quick communications that doesn’t bombard our emails which we keep open for critical communication and outside world communication. However, we do have specific channels which give us updates on signups, which no one is allowed to talk in. It is critical to have rules for the rooms. You also have set rules for slack to make sure you team members don’t turn it into 4chan…The next 5 items are included in this suite. It is really one of the best uses of $5 a month for an employee cost. I don’t believe there is another suite of products that adds more features that cost this low. If there is, please leave a comment below and let me know. Google apps also allow us to set complex password requirements and more importantly two-step authentication. Two-step makes your startup that much more secure, please do this wherever you can (even your personal stuff)!We use this for smaller calls or calls where we need to screen share or see each other face to face. It also comes with our Google Applications account so we don’t have to pay extra for a private chat group. You could use hangout with any gmail account, however, you can’t maintain control over the hangout system outside of the company google apps account. We don’t really use the chat function since slack does that for us, but this is an option for you to chat within the company.We use these to share group documents. Some need to be separated from daily use so we use them appropriately to our tasks. If you have very sensitive documents, Dropbox + BoxCryptor($96/yr) = encrypted documents. I would recommend using this to protect your documents. This combination protects your documents from a hacker getting into your Dropbox account, it makes it much more difficult to access the information if they do break in.We use this because we can work quickly on editing and sharing documents in one place from our gDrive. Doc’s gives us a basic suite of excel, word processing, and powerpoint applications. Most importantly for us, is the feature that suggests edits to a document, this is an amazing collaboration tool. Since we’re all remote and we work different times, it is hard to get everyone to look at one document at the same time, now they don’t have to.A secure place for us to send an email. As part of, the gmail/google apps feature set is that you can assign aliases for users, as example Sunrise is a perfect way to set up meetings and share times that are good for us. Sunrise gives you the option to share a part of your schedule with someone to get them into a timeslot. With Google calendar, we can send a calendar invite out to our entire team or specific people/groups.We use this to A/B test on our website. This has helped us understand how different messaging is driving customers to sign up vs just visit our page. It is an incredible tool for A/B testing. This has led us to have better customer signups. We’ve seen a 40% increase in signups because of knowing what messaging works better.Gives us a way to push social marketing. Twitter, Facebook, even email pushes. Our team members can sign up on HubSpot so we can push out social pushes through their social media accounts without them having to do extra work. It is just a huge time saver, that brings our productivity up.We’ve used GoToMeeting since day one for our weekly conference calls. It gives us a call in number for those of us who call in from landlines. Every week we have one conference call no matter what is going on. Everyone who can join’s in on the call. We take notes and share them with the group through a google doc. This is one of the products you could skip if you are okay using an only online system IE google hangouts. It is pricey after all.Remember tools are only as good as the humans using them. These are just some of the tools we use. I hope this was helpful to get your startup organized.

(And the User Feedback Cycle.)It all started with a tweet by Jokes aside, this is Enter user feedback: the land of insights we didn’t necessarily ask for but got anyway. It’s the land that we all have to cross before we get to launch. Because if you launch before going through the motions, that will cost you and it could kill your product.So let’s try and cross that land together.If you’re not collecting user feedback, you are missing a huge opportunity for growth — both personal and professional. Those who skip this step usually end up releasing a buggy app or Let’s just assume you’ve built an MVP and you’re ready to test it. You have a list of subscribers (if not, Most founders just install a survey widget on their apps: Nope. I’d say there’s Those of you who are thinking long-term know that — especially at the beginning — user feedback has its own cycle. It’s not enough to smack something on your app and pray for instant gratification. Or to email thousands of people with a request and wait for the feedback to rain.Most of the time people don’t respond to general requests. If you want really good feedback, you have to work at getting it, meaning you need to direct your users and ask the right questions. Yes, like the sheep.However, you must avoid “selective questioning” at all costs. If you ask certain questions and avoid others, you’re guiding the answers, which means you’re still building the product you want to build, not the one your users want to use.So how can we make sure we get the right feedback and lots of it?I’ve always liked this visualization based on Whether you call it a So I borrowed this from And then ask more questions, more users, etc. The cycle can go on and on forever, until there are no complaints and no bugs to fix. Only then have you done your best to improve your product.Sure. ☺When we first talked about collecting feedback with my co-founder — This is the page that asks our users to register for the beta. As you can see, they’re required to choose one of three ways to give us feedback: in Slack, via email, and over Skype. We wanted to be thorough and give them options, which paid back big time. In a matter of days we got feedback over Slack and the widget, and we get to send the emails today, which means more feedback!I think in this way everyone is happy — we get feedback from various sources and our users get to choose the way we bug them.If you’re still asking this question, here are a few benefits of feedback:So it solves a few problems that have made a lot of startups fail. For example, the classic “I made this because I think people need it but actually nobody does” or the “I thought my product was perfect for these people but they’re not really interested”, and so on.Nobody likes to be challenged. I don’t particularly look forward to being proven wrong every day, but this is the price I pay for wanting toIf you want to do the same, you’ll have to be ready for:This is all super constructive and has helped us — at I can’t wait to see what will become of our little app. In my dreams, I see it big and so helpful that everyone is using it to improve their meetings.

이 사진을 보면 미국과 우리나라에서 운전을 할 때 느끼는 가장 큰 차이 하나를 발견하게 된다.미국에서는 왼쪽 사진과 같이 ‘여기에서 U턴을 하면 안 된다’고 명시적으로 표시되어 있지 않는 한 어느 곳에서나 U턴을 할 수 있지만, 국내에서는 오른쪽 사진과 같이 ‘여기에서는 U턴을 할 수 있다’고 명시적으로 표시된 곳 외에는 어디에서도 U턴을 할 수 없다.바로 Negative System과 Positive System의 차이다.기본적인 차이는, 미국의 Negative System은 ‘명시적으로 불허되지 않은 모든 것은 허용된다’는 원칙하에 사회 체제가 움직이고, 우리나라의 Positive System은 ‘명시적으로 허용된 것을 제외한 모든 것은 불허한다’는 원칙하에 사회 체제가 움직인다는 것이다.이러한 차이는 단순히 교통 신호 체계 뿐 아니라, 우리 일상 생활, 경제 등 모든 분야에 적용된다.우리 업계와 관련된 예로서 기간통신사업자 허가에 관해서 예를 들어 보자.우리나라에서는 원칙적으로 정부에서 정한 역무 항목에 대하여 정부가 정한 수의 허가만 부여하고, 그 부여 방법도 일반적으로 비 정기적인 정부의 사업권 부여 계획에 따라 사업자가 제안서를 제출하고 정부가 소위 ‘Beauty Contest’ 방식에 의하여 사업자를 선정하는 방식이다. 매번 신규 통신 사업자 선정때마다 주파수 할당, 제안 금액 등으로 많은 뉴스를 양산해 내는 것이 바로 이런 방식때문이다.반면, 이에 해당하는 미국의 FCC 214 라이센스는, 기본적으로 일정 요건을 정해 두고 업체가 라이센스 부여를 신청하면 그 요건이 충족되는 한 기본적으로는 라이센스를 부여하는 방식이다. 그렇기 때문에, 기존의 전화 회사뿐 아니라 자체의 데이터 센터와 통신망이 필요한 구글도 이 라이센스를 가지고 있고, 자체 클라우드 서비스를 위한 데이터 센터를 구축한 애플도 이 라이센스를 가지고 있다. 이 라이센스가 있어야 데이터센터 구축에 필수적인 광 통신망 소위 ‘이러한 차이는 비단 정부의 허가 사항 뿐 아니라, 스타트업이 새로운 영역의 비즈니스를 개척할 때마다 그 비즈니스가 소위 ‘현행법’에 해당되는 사항이 생길 때마다 이슈가 되고 있다.가장 대표적인 것이, 최근 국내에서는 사실 우버 뿐 아니라 생각보다 많은 신규 사업들이 소위 ‘현행법’의 벽에 막혀 있다.P2P 대출 Lending Club — 대부업법그렇다고, 국내에서 스타트업의 혁신적인 기술이 ‘현행법’의 벽을 극복하고 결국 새로운 혁신을 만들어낸 예가 전혀 없는 것은 아니다.90년대 말에 탄생한 온라인결제대행업 (PG) 업체들도 당시 기준으로는 ‘여신전문금융업법’ 위반 상태였다. 하지만, 새로운 기술에 의하여 기존에 없던 새로운 서비스의 탄생을 본 금융 당국에서 당분간 해당 법 적용을 유보하여 주었고, 또 이러한 새로운 서비스를 수용할 수 있도록 2000년대 초반 그 법안을 개정하여 주었기 때문에, 지금 우리는 모든 온라인 쇼핑몰에서 이들 PC 업체를 통해 신용카드 결제를 할 수 있게 된 것이다. 참고로, 이들 PG 업체의 현재 시가 총액은, 통신사의 일부가 된 LG U+를 제외하고 4개사 약 18조원에 달한다.하지만, 이렇게 현행법 위반이라고 하더라도 정책 당국자의 판단에 의하여 해당 법률 적용이 유보되는 ‘운 좋은’ 경우가 매번 있을 수는 없는 법이다.우리나라의 Positive System 체제에서는 구조적으로 혁신적 새로운 기술에 의하여 탄생한 새로운 상품, 서비스에 대하여 현행법이 좇아 가지 못하는 것이 매번 발생할 수 밖에 없다.실제 새로운 기술의 등장에 따라 기존 법 체제가 이와 상충될 때마다 정부에서도 이 이슈를 해결하기 위하여 많은 노력을 기울이고 있지만, 기본적으로는 막혀 있는 상황에서 요것조것 하나씩 풀어 나가는 과정을 거치다 보면 결국 대부분의 잠재적 혁신 기술 및 서비스는 그 시간의 벽을 뚫지 못하고 좌절하게 된다. 마치 Negative System 하의 미국에서 조차도 이러한 류의 이슈가 발생하면, 이에 대응하는 제도를 만드는 것이 무척 발빠르고 일사불란하다. Crowdfunding이 법률적으로 이슈가 되니 2012년에 바로 2000년 조지 부시와 알 고어의 대통령 선거에서 알 고어가 더 많은 득표를 하고도 낙선한 후 물론 당연히 스타트업이 하는 것이니 모든 것에 면죄부를 주고 무엇이든지 허용해 주어야 하는 것은 아니다. 다만, 사회적으로 이슈가 될 소지가 조금이라도 있으면 ‘일단 안돼’ 라는 대응이 아니라, 일단 기술의 발전에 따라 이제까지 없던 새로운 것이 등장하면 그 것이 사회에 확산되는 과정을 먼저 보면서 사회적으로 용납 가능한 새로운 제도를 만들어서 적용하자는 뜻이다.속된 표현으로 “일단 지를 수 있게 해주고, 사회적 이슈가 생기면 하나씩 해결방법을 찾으면서 지속가능한 구조를 만들어 보자”는 뜻이다.‘기존에 명시적으로 허용되는 것 외에는 사회적으로 이슈가 발생할 소지가 있기 때문에 모두 안 돼’라는 positive system과 ‘기존에 불허된 것을 제외한 모든 것이 일단은 허용돼. 다만 사회적으로 이슈가 되면 그때 그에 맞는 새로운 제도를 만들어 보자’라는 negative system, 둘 중에 어느 것이 빠른 기술의 변화에 따라 이제까지 상상하지 못하였던 새로운 상품, 서비스를 만들어 내는 스타트업에게 적절한 시스템인지는 명확하다고 본다.‘현행법의 전방위적 압박’ 속에서 혁신이 숨 쉴 공간을 최소한이라도 만들어 주기를 바라는 것은 이때문이다.이전 이야기:다음 이야기:Entrepreneur-turned venture capitalist @ Translink Capital Korea

This Saturday afternoon, I finally watched The Martian, a space fantasy movie by Matt Damon and Ridley Scott. Despite some Hollywood cheesiness, I loved it and found myself resonate with it so much from the perspective of a business leader, especially in a startup environment. I’d like to share a few takeaways.Most startups die and it’s not a bad idea to assume that you will not succeed while jumping in. Luckily, running a startup is not like launching a rocket ship — in fact, according to Lean Startup, it’s the very opposite of launching a rocket — you just need to fail fast and try again.Startup experience is always a roller coaster ride. Some days would be nicer, like waking up to a sunny and clear day on Mars, but others would be so stormy and deadly cold that it puts you in fear and despair. Some people give up hope when the first storm hits them, while some survive till the very end. And the one thing that sets the survivors apart is their ability to not give up trying — figure out the direction (mission and goal), come up with a plan (math and metric), and relentlessly execute (solving problems) — and do it again and again.NASA in the movie is both the villain and the savior for Mark. NASA will train you and put you on a spaceship to Mars, but if bad things happen, they will take harsh calls often for the “greater common good”. NASA says no to rescuing the one life of Mark and risking five other lives on Hermes, but at the end of the day both NASA and Hermes team rescued Mark.Extrapolate that to the startup world: If you get a tough VC, think of them as NASA —they are the necessary evils — they may have funded your business but they may ditch you when things are going south. If you are building a startup within a big company, think of the Board or SLT as NASA — not everyone there has the good incentive to help you and if your work doesn’t get them credit, they may not help you or even worse, if there is conflict in priority, they may get in your way. So make sure you have some allies up there who can help you out at critical point, like the NASA officer Mitch who facilitated messaging the Hermes rescue route plan that eventually saved Mark. Ultimately, you need to build a team like the crew at Hermes — you can pretty much bet that they will risk their lives for you and your startup — if you have such a team, you will enjoy the ride no matter what.When Mark learned that the first supply booster launch failed, he asked Captain Lewis to meet his parents if he couldn’t make it and tell them that he felt lucky to have done something he loved and was really good at it (botany), and that he was proud to die for something bigger than himself.Pick something you deeply care about and hopefully are good at when you start up something. It’s when you truly believe in what you do that even if you fail, you will put your ego behind and you will be able to embrace the failure and start up again.The startup journey can be an extraordinary experience in itself — like sunbathing in the glorious red Mars landscape or joy of seeing the first leaf sprouting from the earth in greenhouse. There must be something that’s wonderful and memorable — maybe it’s the awesome team you’ve built, maybe it’s those amazing user feedback you’ve received, or maybe it’s all the learnings you’ve got from failing many many times. Then you will be able to call this an epic journey.

Kate Milliken — Grace Teo — McCauley Wanner — I’d support a Change-Up over a Start-Up any day.And yes, while saying Men = StartUp and Women = ChangeUp would be sexist and misguided by my own standards, I do think it is worth noting that not everything that starts up fits a ‘StartUp’ framework and culture. Let’s focus on the outliers, those who are trying to change perceptions and change the world. ChangeUps come from those who are making life more inclusive.I write about the intersection of disability and style. I love beautiful products.

On your way to success, gaining the capital from the seed/VC fund, you will receive Term Sheet where, as well as in the investment agreement, there will be a provision concerning the investor’s dream: the opportunity to exit the investment whose value has increased considerably over time.For the fund it is the essence of taking the investment risk, namely: ‘What will be my potential profit after X time, if I invest Y today.’ Nowadays one can try to type several kind of ‘exits’, but In my opinion, only two of them matter:The geographical and industrial specificity is very important at this point, as it does not always happen that a given industry or location allow for an optimal exit. For instance, the costs of medical companies’ operation on the American market or the costs of the technological companies’ debut on NASDAQ versus the debut on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.Today I would like to tackle the issue of MA, because in the vast majority of cases it is the most common way of exiting the investment. One of the main reasons for such a tendency is the fact that IPO requires that a company has a very high value so that a successful debut can occur. In the case of MA it is easier to achieve the return on the investment. Therefore, in the world of ‘exits’, each start-up has a MA potential, whereas only few companies possess potential for IPO.There is no magic formula for an effective MA process. As any business process, acquisition has to be justified and might result in either a success or a failure. In corporations, MA is the same process as marketing, sales, distribution or RD. The most successful acquisitions are the ones which contribute a real, very measurable value to the current or future processes occurring in the company. Those acquisitions which are less successful or entirely unsuccessful are often justified by ‘extending the portfolio’ or ‘building the third leg’, which indicates large companies’ inability to be innovative and build the company’s value around the financial results in the nearest year.There is no one way to categorize the types of acquisitions. Their variety, reasons, motivations and sizes are too diverse. However, as McKinsley company provides in one of its works, there are certain archetypes which can be distinguished and thanks to which there might be a strategic justification for an acquisition or an investment in a start-up. If your MA process does not fit into one of these archetypes — there is a huge risk involved that it will not succeed (the transaction will not be completed or it will simply be unsuccessful afterwards).The acquisition of your start-up must have its justification in the strategy of the acquiring company and it cannot fit into something uncountable, like ‘ there will be growth thanks to us’ or ‘thanks to sue you will be innovative in this field’. Every purchase has to translate into something tangible, which exerts a measurable and real influence on the functioning of the acquiring entity.One of the most common reasons for the company acquisition. It is a very simple motivation for MA: someone wants to buy your company because they think that it will enable them to lower costs, improve the existing margins or financial flows of their company.It is very important to remember that the highest value that your company/service can contribute to another company (in the process of product sales or the sales of the entire company) is the ability to prove that you can do at least one of these things:a) help someone earn more moneySuch a strategy is fulfilled in the most effective way by Private Equity Funds. They are able to increase, in a very successful way, the efficiency of companies with low margins and low return rate son the invested capital.Mature markets come to face the moment when demand for specific products or components is really high. Therefore, processes of effective optimization of production processes or product distribution can occur which find their way to mature/saturated market. Nowadays it is, for instance, ‘smart home’ market.It is one of the most commonly occurring archetypes for the takeover of technological companies. On the one hand, large companies/corporations possess relationships, distribution channels and sales networks on their markets. On the other hand, young, not large but extraordinarily operationally efficient companies, while making use of technology and talent to build innovative products, very often face problems with launching them into the market in such a manner so as to guarantee for themselves effective and profitable distribution channels which large companies which have had a longer presence on the market already possess.In the case of this archetype, the purchaser wishes to use your product for entering already existing markets so as to thanks to already developed processes/relationships be able to offer something new which would allow, for example, for the increase in the purchaser’s income.There are numerous examples of such operations and certainly, some of them fail to succeed. The examples of the successful ones: Google purchasing DoubleClick or YouTube, Facebook purchasing Instragram or WhatsApp. Unsuccessful ones: Microsoft purchasing Nokia.In my opinion, Cisco excels in such acquisitions:It’s innovation through acquisition. Large corporations have their RD departments and spend enormous money on them. Simultaneously, the product implementation cycle from such RD is so long that these companies are very often surprised by their competition or some new company (Apple vs. Nokia, MySpace vs. Facebook, MS Office vs. Google Docs, Intel vs. ARM). Start-ups, thanks to their innovativeness are able to offer new products quicker and of better quality than corporations. It makes them inclined to meet the decisions to purchase a company/technologies because they notice the potential (they have got their RD) but after the acquisition they will be able to sell it ‘tomorrow’ and not ‘in 3 years’.The strategy of betting the winners. It consists in early purchasing companies or a new product line, notice much earlier than the majority (the competition) how considerable is a given company’s potential. It is a difficult task for a corporation — it requires that large companies understand where the market will be in x time and that company’s managing staff becomes convinced to this vision. What is very interesting is the fact that the majority of large companies plans for years ahead in their strategies but particularly in Poland (although it is a global problem) few of them can understand, estimate and show the influence of technologies and innovations on their business, trying to think in such categories: ‘if technology does not influence my business, it will be exactly the same in three years’. Nothing could be more wrong.Many large companies do not understand the notion of ‘corporate entrepreneurship’ and do not allow their teams/innovators/ talented employees in the corporation to make the technology influence the existing processes. It is usually explained with security issues, integration costs. Unfortunately, the most common reason is lack of understanding of innovation and technological backwardness of the decision makers themselves.The ability to convince a large company that in this race for the market and with such a significant influence on the technology of people’s lives — it is worth betting on that particular horse, that is your start-up, is essential.In the perfect world your start-up is constantly getting stronger and more developed — entering the ‘break even’ stage. Then the income allows you to support you and your company for years. I wish you that scenario. However, it usually happens that technological companies need investments, technological progress is enormous, changes which occur on both consumer markets and B2B are so significant and rapid, and a way to IPO is long (currently, it is approximately 10–12 years) that one of cards on the table is the fact that your start-up can be bought and developed further within another group. This is also the scenario that I wish for you.A collection of articles from The Startup Magazine and, writers we like on Medium. Covering startups, tech, business entrepreneurship, and working life.

Entrepreneurs who neglect the legal basics can collapse a business before it even gets started. Here’s how you’ll have a serious leg-up on your future and your competition.When you start a business, the opportunities are limitless: for growing wealth, for gaining a new lifestyle, for changing the world — and for making mistakes that will make you wish you’d been more savvy at the beginning. Below are five of the most common legal errors that startups make.Choosing a name is one of the first decisions you’ll make as a new business owner, but before you even get started on this, there are some legal matters you’ll need think through. Your job at this point is to find a name that is all yours to trademark, which means doing a thorough search for any names you consider, as well as any similar names. You don’t want to print a truckload of t-shirts with your logo on them, only to find out that there’s already a company in Iowa with the same name. Use the Internet, check the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and finally, run everything by an Intellectual Property lawyer to make sure you haven’t missed anything.When you are establishing your startup, it’s vital that you obtain any relevant trademarks, patents, or copyrights before your intellectual property is out for public consumption. The obvious risk you run by not doing so is that, if unprotected, your creations are fair game for competitors to steal.There’s another caveat here that might seem less obvious: In addition to worrying about your competitors, you must also guard against intellectual theft by your collaborators and employees. Get in the habit of requiring them all to sign confidentiality agreements, also known as Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). That way, third parties and employees can give you the benefit of their expertise and labor, and you can rest assured that your creations won’t disappear out the door with them when they leave.It’s one of the biggest questions facing any new business owner: What legal structure will your company have? Much has been written (on this very blog, in fact) about this subject. For the topic at hand, the main point to grasp is that, although it is possible to change formats later on, this is a highly undesirable state of affairs. Even putting aside all the lamentable occurrences that might prompt you to switch formats — unforeseen liabilities, tax issues, ownership disputes — the steep fees and mountain of paperwork involved in switching make it worth your while to consider the matter carefully up front, so you won’t need to change your structure later.When you’re starting a company, everything looks rosy: You see only success on the horizon, and you and your business partners will be happy together forever. Needless to say, this may not always be the case. As unpleasant as it may seem, you absolutely must have a written agreement with your co-founders that covers every foreseeable negative outcome. You will need to agree on what happens if a partner leaves, how duties will be shared, how much of a stake each partner has, how to oust a co-founder, and countless other scenarios. It’s much better to figure it all out at the beginning, when everyone is still on friendly terms.The ownership structure of your company should dictate that equity will vest over a period of years. In a way, this is insurance against certain human failings, like betrayal, freeloading, and petty arguing. By requiring co-founders to stay active and productive for a certain period of time, you can avoid being left to do more than your share of the work for less than your share of compensation.Bonus mistake: Thinking you can do it all without a lawyer! It’s almost certain that, somewhere down the line, your business will encounter circumstances you never would have anticipated on your own. Plus, if your venture is as successful as you know it will be, someday there’s going to be a lot of money at stake. An initial investment in good legal advice will repay itself many times over.See what we’re building over at Sharing my startup lessons. Founder  CEO at 

When I first moved to Berlin about 3 years ago, it was exactly for the reasons why most young people come to the city: the great vibe, the big startup scene and the relatively inexpensive cost of living compared to other major German cities. I’d lived in Düsseldorf and London before, and knew I wouldn’t find better living at a better price than in Berlin.After spending a year and a half building a strong recruiting team for a boutique agency in the city, I had an idea for a startup and immediately dove into the scene. I quickly realized how small and intimate Berlin’s startup community is — comprised of many ex-WHU students. They are typically very successful at what they do. A recent article in Der Spiegel about the German startup scene I’ve been back in London for just over 6 months now, and have inevitably been comparing the two cities and their respective startup scenes. I’ve also had the chance to gather some other opinions on the topic. First, London has a much bigger startup scene than Berlin and therefore a lot more resources to expand internationally. For me, London has always been the doorstep to the US, which makes it especially attractive.Another impression I have about German companies is they always perform great in the German-speaking countries, but have a hard time winning outside the borders. Xing vs. Linkedin is a prime example of this. On the other hand, it does seem harder for companies from the outside to conquer the German-speaking market. We’ve seen this with Facebook vs. StudiVZ. That’s also a reason why Rocket Internet has been so successful copying proven business models from the US, bringing them to Germany, and getting them acquired by the U.S. competitors (i.e. Alando and Ebay).After speaking with a few people about Berlin, they also see the city’s startup scene as still wearing the kids’ shoes. There are currently just a handful of great VCs in Berlin, and ultimately it’s still hard to get money. Lifestyle startups abound and people are enjoying the hype. It doesn’t necessarily have the more serious, international vibe of London’s tech scene. In London, you’ll find three times as many startups due to the size of the city, its money and its resources. I also get the impression that it’s easier to grab attention and build something for the whole world when you’re based in London, but of course that depends on your business.Despite this, Berlin is a great place and I loved it there. Coworking spaces like St. Oberholz and Betahaus are helping to grow the tech scene. At the end of the day, it always depends on your product and where your customers are. Mattan Griffel I would still recommend Berlin for startups. It’s the team work that makes the dream work, and you can build companies anywhere in the world. Berlin is a great place to begin, but going international might be easier to do in London (at least that’s where I met my great co-founders at Squelo).Exciting times lie ahead in London, but I’ll always go back to Berlin every now and then. The vibe is just something special.Co-Founder Curated essays from Berlin’s start-up scene.

At Before you think about resourcing up your team further you’ll need to do some homework. Here’s our suggestions on where to start.You’re probably thinking you can tackle most PM responsibilities yourself, and that’s completely fair. You may not need a full-time product manager, but you may still have to share those responsibilities between several team members. After all, being part of a startup means that you and your team will be doubling on roles.Does your product have a vision? Do you have a direction? Do you even know what you’re building and for whom? A product manager can answer all these important questions and ensures that rather than just throwing a bunch of features together, you’re actually solving a problem.Part of a product’s life cycle and management is to gather ideas and feedback. At first, you may not have defined your success metrics, or even have enough customers to make an educated decision about what changes to make, or even where your product fits in the market so you are able to make those strategic changes. By gathering feedback from your team, you’ll not only be able to gather some great ideas and influence openness within your own team, but you’ll be able to understand how and where your team stands on important decisions. Most importantly, you’ll understand how your team is working, which will allow you to analyse and apply any needed changes to improve productivity, and deliver better products.The most important thing to keep in mind, is that hiring a product manager indicates product maturity. If you’re at a point where you simply cannot handle all the tasks by yourself or by splitting it between your existing team members, you’ve reached a point in which your product has grown and needs a bit more love and dedication around the edges. This is good news! You’re no longer just a bunch of features put together — you’re solving a real world problem.As your product matures, the PM’s role will become increasingly time-consuming. So as the team grows, some entrepreneurs will hand over the product reigns to an experienced product manager so that the product can continue to grow and mature properly. Some entrepreneurs find that they’d rather work more closely with the product itself, and so hand over the reigns to the CEO role so that they can focus on what they started, and on what they love: the product.How do you balance your time working at a startup?Unicorn connoisseuse and human to a dog.

It’s 5:47 AM the morning after Phoenix Startup Week, February 28, 2015. That’s the latest I’ve slept in all week. My body has been waking up on pure adrenaline every morning. But today, it’s not that which has me wide-eyed and sitting at my computer the morning after five 16-hour days in a row. Today, What happened this week? How do I recap such an overwhelmingly positive five days? Honestly, it’s a bit of a blur. There’s not just But these numbers don’t express what As you might suspect, there are lots of stories to tell from this week.A number of college students came up to me over the week, very enthusiastic by the event as a whole. One said that he didn’t know what he wanted to do yet, only that he wanted to “eventually do something in startups.” He was learning and networking beyond his expectations, marked by thankfulness in all he shared.I met two employees used their hard-earned vacation time to take five days off of work and immerse themselves in the week’s events. One of them has a startup that he has built on nights and weekends while working for a large local enterprise company. He’s bootstrapped, and now, after years of passionate work on his idea, he’s nearly ready to make the leap of faith and quit his nine-to-five. He is married with five kids and confessed his trepidation about the plunge. But Startup Week proved to him the community that awaits him with open arms, ready to help.Two young Hispanic women looked excited, but uncertain about who to speak with at one of the week’s happy hours. They heard about Phoenix Startup Week during some of the week’s television coverage and knew they needed to come out and meet others. I asked them to pitch me their idea, but said, “We don’t know how.” They rambled for a little bit and I rephrased it in a more succinct phrase (whether right or wrong): a Beauty Concierge for Busy Professional Women. Their eyes went wide, exclaiming, “That’s why we need to be here!” I introduced them to some other busy professionals and executives — their target customers — and they spoke for the rest of the happy hour. They also walked away with contacts and others to help them as they start on the path to starting their business together.Still others stood as cheerleaders for the event throughout the entire week, faces we looked to in the stands for support throughout the week. While many of the planners (including myself) thought that we would only see people attend single days given our rotation throughout the valley before the week, we saw many of the same faces nearly every day. Some of the faces we knew — the familiar, friendly, and encouraging faces of people like One of the several Chase volunteers that were present during the week said that this so invigorated and inspired her that she almost felt ready to “do something.” I told her she should. (Sorry if you lose an employee, Chase, but I’m sure they’ll be a loyal new business customer!)Finally, the overwhelming consensus I heard from those who have been active in the local startup scene for years, even decades, was:The same goes for me, having personally met hundreds of new people.These stories just scratch the surface of all those that emerged out of Phoenix Startup Week.So, how did this all come about? How did Phoenix enjoy the fortune of hearing and witnessing so many inspiring stories between Monday, February 23 and Friday, February 27, 2015?We’re back to the culprit that woke me up this morning. You see, maybe you’ve heard my name a lot this week and leading up to this event. But I’m just one small part of this big, beautiful puzzle that was formed before all of our eyes. I received so many thanks and congratulations this week, and while I appreciate all the kind words, that’s not what this is about.I shared some of the numbers earlier, but now, allow me to pull back the curtain of this spectacle to reveal the humble wizards that made this entire thing possible. Their names deserve writing, honoring, and knowing.Phoenix Startup Week happened because of less than three months of The City of Scottsdale should be proud of Enough cannot be said about After mentioning Paige, I must also thank After learning that job fairs had been successful parts of other markets’ Startup Weeks, Everyone in Phoenix startups knows The list goes on. Then there was the wonderful news coverage of locals like While I can’t thank our sponsors at the corporate level enough (truly, truly,I’m also proud and thankful to have spent time with the entire To To To I haven’t even yet named other mentors, venue hosts, promoters, volunteers, and content providers like And oh yeah, I haven’t even named all of the Last, but certainly not least, I want to thank my own amazing family for giving up time with me the past couple months. I could not do half of the things I do without This barely scratches the surface. There were other volunteers at other venues that I didn’t even have the chance to personally meet. There were other presenters, panelists, and moderators I didn’t get to hear. This massive list of people just serves as yet one more example of how broad the support of our ecosystem reaches.I just listed over I am better for knowing each and every one of them.More names will emerge next year, I am convinced. They will be people drawn in by the success of this first year and with the best of intentions. But let it be said now: the years of Phoenix Startup Week successes and stories that follow this inaugural event will be built upon the shoulders of these humble and hardworking servants of the city I have just named. Remember them. Honor them.I’m sure you’re asking:But for now, let’s just be grateful. This tome of a letter that I began to write this morning doesn’t do justice to all that I feel right now, but I’m sure you get the point. In the simplest and sincerest of words:Please share this with whomever you know that was impacted by or interested in our inaugural event.

By the strictest definition of the word, we failed.We were a startup For five years, we gave it everything we had:Collectively, we labored in furtherance of one common (and ambitious) goal: allowing sports fans to predict the play before it happens.Things didn’t always go according to plan. There were outages. There were crashes. There were agonizing nights where we felt powerless. There were times when it would have been easier to give up. There were setbacks. There were sacrifices. There were disagreements.But in the aggregate, there was also a lot more good than bad. We learned together and grew together — both as a company and as individuals. We built games that people spent hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of hours playing while they watched their favorite teams.But on a Friday night in May, the last guesses were pushed and the final predictions were made. It feels like we failed, even though I know it’s not that simple, and I know it’s not really true.Truthfully, we succeeded in building something awesome, but that was never a guarantee we would be successful in the long run. And really, that’s the toughest thing for me to come to terms with. We grow up thinking that life is linear, and if we make something great, it will be a success.Unfortunately, that is a gross oversimplification of the way the world works.As I continue to process that the PrePlay apps are no longer running, I keep coming back to the age-old paradigm of trying to balance something fun and something you’re passionate about with something that can grow into a sustainable business. Most of the time, it’s a high wire act, and the stakes sometimes threaten to take over the rest of your life.For the last few years, as PrePlay’s Director of Quality Assurance, I was so entrenched in the process of making sure things were working properly, there wasn’t much time for anything else. Surely, things were equally challenging for the people who were tasked with making sure our bottom was healthy enough to sustain operations, and I never once envied their position. If anything, I admired the hell out of them for keeping our company alive for as long as they did.The nature of my job always had me focusing on things that were right in front of my face. It was so easy to get into work and dive into the app for 9 hours and then look up and wonder where the day went. But there were times when I was able to take a step back and look at the broader picture.Those were some of my favorite times of the last few years.I would suddenly look up and I was at the US Open working next to people from IBM and the USTA. I would find myself at a castle in the French countryside attending a company-wide conference with our New York and Paris offices. I’d be sitting in a room and 95 percent of the conversation would be in French, and it was perfectly normal. When people asked me what I did for work, I would basically tell them “I get paid to watch sports and play an app.”My 12 year old self would have thought that was the coolest thing ever. My 29 year old self agrees.I’ve failed at things before, and this doesn’t feel like failure is supposed to.We built something that worked. We built something that was fun and engaging. What we built (and subsequently spent thousands of hours to fine-tune and perfect) was 100 percent in line with the original idea and goal of PrePlay.That’s what makes shutting down our app so difficult. Part of me feels this would all be easier to accept if we But that wasn’t the case.Not that the performance of the app was fait accompli. There was a time, early on, when we never really knew for sure if the thing would work when that first pitch was thrown or that first puck was dropped. Eventually, once we hit our stride within a few years, we Of course, when you become accustomed to the technology we have at our fingertips every day, you start to take it for granted. Nowadays, when we hold something in our hand that would have blown our mind five years ago, we are easily frustrated when it takes longer than three seconds to load. It’s like Louis CK said: “everything’s amazing and nobody’s happy.”Even with our growing expectations for how the app should perform, there was a certain magic that you felt when a batter was walking to the plate and PrePlay would ask you to predict “Hit/Out/Walk” as the catcher was putting down the signs.In spite of that, however, the bottom line never quite added up. After five years of pouring blood, sweat, and tears into PrePlay, the costs were too high and the revenues simply too low. It was a difficult reality to face, but where we ended up doesn’t define the overall worth of the experience.Besides the amazing people I met along the way, the biggest thing I’ll take away from this experience is that you can never aim too high. There were times when I legitimately thought we were being too ambitious and that we wouldn’t make it. More often than not, we found a way.Two years ago, in an effort to save money and create a better app experience, we decided that we would internally record and transmit data from NFL and College Football games to power our football app instead of relying on a 3rd party data provider. The project was huge and beyond intimidating. After all, there are entire companies built solely to record and provide sports data in a matter of seconds, and we were trying to do that on our own. In addition to everything else.We had a meeting where 80 percent of the company’s personnel admitted they weren’t sure if we could pull it off — there were just too many variables. What about when plays are reviewed and overturned? What about time delays from our TV feed? What about penalties? What about human error?Despite the challenges, we did not waver. We built custom software to record the data. We hired and trained part-time game stringers who came in on Saturdays and Sundays. We got DirecTV hooked up to 12 TV’s in our office and equipped them with Sunday Ticket.I can’t quite describe how it felt when Week 1 of the NFL season commenced, and things went off without a hitch. It was one of the sweetest victories of the entire experience, and I’ll carry that with me for the rest of my life.Now, whenever I feel like something Come to think of it, maybe we didn’t fail at all.I don’t have it figured out. I’m just trying to write my way through it.A Sports Illustrated® publication. (By way of Medium.)

Whether you’re breaking down meats or dicing a handful of fresh herbs, it’s difficult to imagine what cooking would be like without a trusted knife. After all, there has to be more than a few good reasons why chefs would consider a knife to be the most valuable tool in their kitchen, right?But while it might make perfect sense for professional chefs to invest hundreds of dollars into their knives, it can be difficult for home cooks to justify the same purchase without breaking their budget.Recently, a pair of Brooklyn chefs — along with an industrial designer friend — set out to solve this frustrating experience of searching for a professional chef’s knife on a home cook’s budget once and for all.The result of their research is Misen — a new company that aims to redefine kitchenware essentials with premium materials, thoughtful design and honest pricing.After launching a Kickstarter campaign for their Misen Chef’s Knife on September 22nd, the team managed to raise their campaign goal — $25,000 — in just a single hour.By the time their campaign came to a close on October 22nd, Misen’s first product had raised a staggering $1,083,344 USD from 13,116 backers — one $65 knife at a time.So how did a small team with a good idea take one of the oldest tools known to man — a handled blade — and make it new again?Thanks to developments in rapid prototyping — or 3D printing — within the last decade, the process of going from an initial sketched idea to a finished product design has never been as accessible or affordable as it is today.To create their million-dollar knife concept, the Misen crew turned to the Here, Misen co-founder Omar Rada and NYC-based 3D Hub provider Dano Wall give us further insight into the process of creating the runaway Kickstarter hit:Also, we’re not creating a Spend time building a community of like-minded individuals early on and prepare for long hours of work in advance of your campaign.

After trial and error, I eventually settled on a PET and polyester mix, printed on a slightly warm bed at very slow speed. This yielded high definition and extremely durable results that I was happy to pass on to Omar for further testing.For those that might have missed out on the Could To find out more about how a local 3D Hub like Worlds largest network of 3D Printers.

We’re fighters, we went to war for the company.It wasn’t easy, we had to support the company with every penny we had, and take zero salary, I sold my bike and had to live in the office for 3 weeks and then I lived for 2 weeks at a friend’s for free, because I couldn’t pay rent, we took another loan from a friend and focused on We hustled hard in every direction, we scanned our network of friends and old colleagues for potential deals and started offering, at some point out of desperation I convinced a customer who operates in a different market to test Egypt through our service and paid the office rent with his money.. we kept hustling for big deals (Silver Bullets), but time was against us, we couldn’t pay the salaries for two months and we had to let some people go, it was the most devastating thing.Finally after months of negotiations we secured a couple of big deals, and we managed to collect our money from old customers, we managed to cut cost without compromising culture, we fixed many process problems and we even created and currently testing a business model for one of our products.— It’s not over until the fat lady sings.— If you lose the last game, nobody gives a shit.— Unnecessary growth kills.— Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.— If you build it, they will not come. — Recurring revenue is — Be shameless and pitch everyone.— Always ask “what do you think?”.— Choose your co-founders very carefully.— Take care of the people, and they will take care of you.— Don’t carry the weight alone.— Keep it professional, for your own sake.— Hiring mistakes are the most expensive.— Don’t just stay relevant, stay necessary.— Hire smarter people, smarter than you.— Firing is not as hard as it seems.

It’s easy to find successful entrepreneurs. They’re all over the news and all anyone ever talks about as they secure more and more funding, their businesses thrive and they just get everything right. I love these success stories, but they paint an unbalanced picture of the industry.When you look at the data, most cite a scary-high failure rate for startups. Personally, I think it’s rather ominous that nine out of every ten startups fail.What’s even scarier is how few people actually look into the reasons behind each failure. Fail and fail quickly is a term that’s been thrown around in nearly every conversation on startups I’ve had, but it’s even more important to understand what went wrong and what could have been done better.Taking examples from real startups, just like yours, here’s the hard truths these founders faced before closing their doors. Learn from their experience, and don’t make these mistakes yourself.Working hard is what it takes, but you need to focus on the right metrics. It’s easy to fall into a routine of busy work as you chase an arbitrary number, say 1,000 email subscribers or 5,000 Facebook fans before putting a product out there but this is a mistake. The hours and hours you’ve spent Gift recommendation platform Or If your business solves a need, an actual need your customers believe is important, you’re going to be fine. Don’t focus your efforts on a perceived problem that no-one cares about. Fortune found this too. 42% of the failed startups Just like Or Just because you’ve got a brilliant team of founders and a *rock-star* CEO, you can’t neglect the fundamentally boring (yet critical) processes of your company. Assigning specific responsibilities to certain people does not mean you’re good-to-go. Startups need to be fluid, able to respond to changes in the market, and have a scalable business model at their core. There’s only so long you can “fake it” until you need the Or Customers are spoilt for choice. It’s a simple fact. In almost every market you can imagine there’s a solution in place to currently meet their needs. Your startup needs to find a novel approach, offer a better solution, or if there really is nothing like it; make it clear, simple and easy for your target customers to understand why you’re solving this need, and why they need your business to overcome it.No matter the industry you’re looking to disrupt, if you’re lacking a deep knowledge of the subject, the ability to tackle problems creatively, and an unwavering amount of stamina to get you through the late nights, early mornings and endless pitches; things are going to be tough. Be passionate about the business you’re in. It’ll give a competitive edge, and who really wants to spend all their waking hours on a product that’s not exciting?Entrepreneurship isn’t a lifestyle endeavor. You’re putting obstacles in your path if you’re gallivanting about all over the world, or only running your business as a side-project. There’s a reason the investors in Shark Tank are only ever interested in businesses where the founder is 100% dedicated to the project; so make sure you are too. There is no miraculous “overnight success” or ways to avoid the hard work. You just need to do it.It’s almost impossible to survive in a startup on your own. You need people. Find a network of customers, suppliers, service providers, employees and co-founders (all people), who share a common passion and will help you succeed. These seven lessons cover a broad range of failures, using real examples to demonstrate just how important each one is to a startups success. One screw-up can mean you’re headed rapidly down the wrong path.Learn from the failures from the entrepreneurs who have gone before you, and get your plan in order. These mistakes are all easy fixes if you tackle them head-on, so clear the elephant from the room and make sure your startup isn’t lacking on any fronts.For the other startup founders out there, is there anything you wish you would have done differently?

Not everyone is profoundly affected by being part of a startup — some people don’t change at all. And of course, lots of people don’t like startups! But for many people, startups are a huge and life-altering experience. This is especially true if they “I definitely expected immediate reach and success,” says Rosengarten has For Rosengarten, this derives from years of experience. For young or first-time startup founders, it’s a common mistake to believe that working constantly will always lead to success. But it doesn’t. Working constantly can lead to burnout, or can even be counterproductive while it’s happening, especially when people overestimate their capacity. And as Rosengarten points out, if we acknowledge that startups can fail — and Silicon Valley is famously hospitable to failure — then perhaps we should acknowledge that a particular company isn’t worth sacrificing too much for.Startup failure shaped “It was a huge eye-opener,” says the older version of Loscavio today.Many people associate startups with wildness and risk-taking. But it sounds like they’re also a good place to gain wisdom.Share what youre reading for work.

It’s September 1, 2014 — Zach and I have no jobs, we have no company concept, and we live in different cities. To create some kind of company….thing, we really needed to be in the same room drawing and redrawing on white boards. Zach decided to move to NYC, which was kind of him to offer and solved one issue, but created another: NYC apartments don’t like broke people with no income.Zach spent the first few weeks sleeping on my couch, his brother’s couch, his uncle’s couch, before we found a sporadic sublet for $150/month. The apartment was a one-bedroom steal but doubled as a budding somelier’s wine cave. Her wifi password was “RubSomePu$$yOnIt69.”Not a permanent solution.During Zach’s RubSomePu$$yOnIt69 phase, I was hitting up every other grad student I knew in NYC for a potential sublet. And then, we bumped into Mike (not real name). I originally met him while I was recruiting PhDs for McKinsey so I knew he would be interviewing. Zach and I approached and I asked Mike how he was doing through the process and then asked whether he knew anyone with an apartment they could sublet. As it turns out, he was looking to sublet I knew he paid ~$900 a month so over email that night offered him as thin a profit margin as possible: $1,000. He wrote back saying he regularly made $2,000. Shit. Well, we didn’t have the money he wanted but it occured to us that we used to have the job he wanted. So, we counteroffered:He took the offer, we spent 16 hours coaching him and Zach’s been living in his apartment for 10 months now. Eventually, that apartment would see two more cofounders move in — Kiran and Robert — and allowed us to bootstrap for months.Our final McKinsey-prep hourly rate: $850.I love my family, Oystir (the startup I cofounded), archery, comic books, making pesto, and collecting brains.

In the wake of Uber’s and Airbnb’s multi-billion dollar valuations, “disruption” — a term popularized by Clayton Christiansen in Disruption describes a market entrant utilizing an innovative business model to provide customers greater value than industry incumbents, often through new technology. It instantly renders incumbents less competitive, if not irrelevant, as the new entrant seizes large chunks of market share and the wealth that the industry previously created is re-concentrated. (To be fair, Uber and Airbnb may reduce wealth concentration by enabling drivers and renters to turn consumption goods into capital goods.)For Uber and Airbnb, disruption has occurred in industries governed by protective regulation (taxis  hotels) or where previous operators added relatively little specialized value and often a poor experience (sorry, taxis).What about industries that aren’t quite so ripe?At first glance, laundry and dry cleaning might seem like an ideal industry for disruption. Laundry is a hassle even for those with in-home washer/dryers, dry cleaning can be worse depending on your options, and outsourcing common chores has become an urban mantra. If a would-be disruptor can build an Uber-for-laundry, will your dry cleaner go the way of the taxi cab?Possibly.Uber-for-laundry But very few have the resources to build a mobile solution to a problem of distribution. Without innovation, disruption may be unavoidable.A little over a year ago, my co-founder Dan Tobon and I had a conversation about his dad’s laundry business, competition from laundry apps, and disruption. We determined to build technology that would enable the best local cleaners to provide customers with that same great mobile experience. We spent the next year studying the industry and speaking with operators and experts in order to build a technology platform truly customized to the needs of cleaners. Along the way, Starchup benefited from an unparalleled support structure when we joined the first cohort of The Starchup Platform gives cleaners the technology to efficiently manage their delivery process, including a dashboard and driver app, and the ability to reach customers through two mobile channels: the Rather than disrupt, Starchup As we prepare to launch the Starchup App in Chicago next Monday, it is exciting to reflect on the potential that startup innovation has to empower, not just to disrupt, industries of operators large and small. As the Unicorns show, technology can create immense value; how that value is distributed may be the key to its future._P.S. - We would love to hear your feedback! And feel free to check out our 

“I didn’t know what it meant to be an entrepreneur,” says Lately, the air is thick with startup mythos and the streets are paved with convertible notes, so it might seem easy to leave a steady job for a startup. But it’s still a big decision with lifelong implications.So why do it? For some people, startups are a great way to find their voice, be creative, and feel like they’re making an impact. Of course, there are plenty of stereotypes about startups — but there’s truth behind the stereotypes. Here are the in-depth reasons that Quibb members described when we asked why they dropped out of Big Companyland and moved to Startupland.Walter Chen had a strong desire to express himself, which was not being satisfied when he worked at a big law firm in New York. “It was fine. It was totally fine,” he says, “but there was a desire to build and create something. In a law firm you’re arguing on behalf of large corporations, whereas when you start your own company, you can speak in your own voice.”A lot of other startup founders described similar feelings — and employees, too. For many people, the transition is all about the opportunity to do creative and concrete work, even if they aren’t building their own thing.Early in his career — back in the 1990s — “I think I underestimated how hard it was, because there’s no guide or map to a successful startup,” says Loscavio today. “I expected a guide or a pattern. I wanted ‘how to be a startup owner in 24 hours,’ but that doesn’t exist. It takes so much hard work and so much thought.”Ultimately, Loscavio thrived on the difficulty. His first business went under, yet his hard work paid off because it was visible to the next person who hired him. “My first startup tried to do too much too fast,” he says. “We undercut our bread and butter revenue by quickly jumping into the manufacturing business. We ultimately diluted our time and money so much that we lost focus of the core competency that our e-commerce business had thrived on, and thus we inevitably went out of business. But my next employer was ATT — my recruiter had been an investor at my company, and he knew directly all the work it had taken me to build my startup, and that’s why he recommended me.”Walter Chen of IDoneThis remembers being impressed by startup founders, because it sounded so difficult. “When I was a lawyer, I was doing my summer internship, and I was sitting next to this associate, and I asked him what he did,” says Chen. “He told me he was an entrepreneur and talked about how he was raising money from investors, and I was so impressed. He was my age, and I couldn’t imagine doing that at the time.”Even though Frankie Loscavio enjoyed his work at ATT, he eventually went back to startups, and is currently working for MedTech Exchange to innovate cost-cutting solutions for the health industry. “Aside from my first company, I’ve been part of three other startups,” he says. “After a while, you start to realize you have more potential, more influence, and more ability to make things happen if you’re not just a cog in a machine.”The competitive advantage of a smaller business is better service — which means that a startup founder has both the responsibility Paul Graham, who started the high-profile startup accelerator Y Combinator, often tells founders to Rosengarten explains: “While I was at one of my startups, someone from Yahoo reached out and said that they wanted me to be part of a 4-person team that ran around Yahoo and caused a bunch of problems. They said, ‘We don’t really care what you do, cause fires and make money.’ We did exceptionally well and made a bunch of money for Yahoo, but we started to feel more constricted over time. We were building tools that would make Yahoo’s tools more successful, but the bureaucracy stopped successful products from being successful.”Pretty much everyone who’s gone from a big company to a startup agrees: It’s amazing to work in an environment with so much less process. “People matter to me,” says Michael Rosengarten. “I liked my colleagues at Yahoo, and I thought they were smart and interesting, but my biggest gripe was that I was surrounded by people who… well, 9–5 was not an important part of their day. In retrospect, I realize that it was unreasonable for me to expect that from my colleagues at Yahoo. But for me, 9–5 is just as important as the rest of my day.”A while back, while Okay, this isn’t the “You often go into things for the wrong reasons,” acknowledges Walter Chen. “I heard a lot of dramatic things about being a lawyer, and my reasons for going into that career were terrible. So maybe I also got into startups because it sounded cool. And the other day I talked to a Thiel fellow who got started after watching “I didn’t put that much thought into what I was doing,” says Walter Chen. “And taking the leap is glorified. But when other people make the transition, I encourage them to put more thought into it than I did.It’s cliché, but true — not every company is right for everyone. And startups are “For me, when I joined a startup, I finally felt comfortable in my work environment — even though it took some time to adapt to the policy-free, just-get-it-done workplace,” Glenn concludes. “Joining a startup was like coming home.”Share what youre reading for work.

Change is good. Change means progress. Change means you learned something new and took action. Being open to change is the #1 thing you need to succeed in a startup culture… and was also my biggest kryptonite when I first started at Social Tables.My struggle with change stems from my mindset of always wanting to be “right.” I used to think that change meant you were wrong the first time, and you had to go back to change (correct) your mistake. Take that mindset, add a healthy dose of stubbornness, and you’ve got a recipe for a startup employee disaster.Thankfully, Dan Berger created a culture of embracing change at ST: I used to do things “right” once and move on without looking back. I did it right the first time, so why would I need to change it? It’s already right! Change could only make things worse! Lucky for me, every day is a school day at ST, and I learned quickly that every moment is a learning opportunity.Looking at every data point and asking yourself “What did this teach me?” or “Knowing this, what can I change?” have become critical to how I approach everything.Looking at your own work and making a change is step 1. Being able to accept, love, and appreciate feedback from others is step 2. It’s also the biggest step.You have to love, crave, and appreciate feedback. When I realized the biggest block to my personal and professional development, Now, every time I get feedback, the first thing that triggers in my head is “thank you.” Thank the person who is trying to help you get better. The perspective is priceless, and you’re lucky he or she cares enough to help you improve.Now? I’m addicted to change. If things aren’t changing, I get uneasy. If we aren’t changing our goals, strategies and tactics on a regular basis, that means we aren’t learning and improving. When I start to feel comfortable, I know it’s time to change.In a fast-growing company, flexibility and adaptability are an advantage over your established competitors. To be a top performer in an environment focused on growth, learning to change as the company grows is key.growing Personal Development Stories of Social Tables Employees

Today it seems every college student is either working on a business or knows someone starting one.But when I was in college, no one I knew was starting a business.No, wThe main reason for the bands is that they are (or were, for me) so much fun. For most of us, any dreams of musical influence ended at the campus gate or at best, the local community. And most of us were fine with that since we didn’t think we were building enduring acts. We wanted to play music and so we did. “Startup” costs and time to market: next to nothing.Your ability to join a band was based on musical ability and whether people knew about your ability. Your ability to put together a group was based on those factors plus whether you could find and manage people. Your success as a group was based on your ability to find good gigs to play, get the word out about them and keep the group together.Like I said, none of us (well, few of us) were doing this because we thought we’d be big stars making serious money. We did it because it was fun; we had something to say. There were also no adults telling us that there was a structured way to optimize our song writing or to grow our target audience. So we just did it. The term “helicopter parenting” had yet to be invented. Likewise, the startup incubator had yet to be developed.Today, now that college bands have turned into startups, the scene is different. There are a lot of adults running around telling the kids how to play.It’s the kind of thought that makes you pause in front of the bathroom mirror, faucet running, toothbrush in hand…Speaking of teeth, remember what Frank Zappa said in response to Tipper Gore’s claim that music can incite deviant behavior? He said Of course, Zappa also said that Back to the funny thought.Back to my experience playing in a college band. First of all, it was the most fun I had in college. I learned a ton about music and in ways that I couldn’t have had I stuck with the larger official music groups on campus.If I stretched the history a bit, I could also say that I learned about team dynamics, marketing and running events.In that ancient era, in the days before Facebook or MySpace (since we’re speaking of music), we didn’t think the same way about promoting our work. Then again, we didn’t think of it as work either.Promoting our music happened in a few ways. First, we would just tell everyone we knew about upcoming shows. Since the shows were all local, there was no need for any extended media presence. So what if we could reach people around the world if they weren’t going to come in to hear us play? All of our recordings (shows, studio sessions) were on tape (a CD was always in the works) so there wasn’t an easy global distribution model.But there was a great Given all of the above and my growing experience working with Let’s hit each of these points one by one.Remember that the first (and most secret) goal of the Disposable Startup is to get experience doing something. The goal is not to deal with the common problems of business models, looking for customers or elements of design or development beyond the capabilities of the current team. If you run this business into the ground over the course of a couple semesters, as long as you also delivered on the above points, then you will learn.Again, this relates to your choice of market. If you choose a market that you are a part of and are surrounded by every day, you’ll be at an advantage over those who choose a theoretically more attractive market that they cannot easily reach or serve. Also, if you choose a market where cycle times are short, you’ll also be able to iterate faster than those who must deal with lengthy decision-making.In some cases, you’re also in a semi-protected market. One student-run food delivery business I know can compete on college campuses simply because they have access to campus buildings.Even if you think you’re not building a business that will endure, these steps will help you build your next business better. And since I’m now largely working with student and alumni founded businesses in which I cannot hold equity, I have as much of an interest in their current learning and future success as anything today.As a college student you understand this market in a way that others even a few years older do not. Your professors, even if they went to the same institution, probably had a very different experience from yours, simply by attending at a different time. The tools and platforms used were different; the interests were different. I, for one, am constantly bewildered by the behavior of college students. That’s fine — I’m not the target customer of a Disposable Startup.Today, many of the more Advisors mean well but often lack an intuitive sense for how markets develop and for how companies can grow into new markets. As such, they may warn you against going into a small market. An easy example of this is judging Facebook in 2004 as restricted to the small market of college students.The other problem with being swayed by market size is that experience in what starts out as a small market is real experience. I put a higher value on real experience operating in a small market than the theoretical ability to one day operate in a large market (while most likely not lasting long enough to get any operational experience at all).If things go well for your business, you can grow into a new market. If things don’t go well, you’ll still get more experience than most other college companies, because you’ll be surrounded by your customers and delivering value, rather than searching for customers and theorizing about the value you could deliver.One student-run career startup I know is so close to student demand for internships that they are already delivering relevant internships to students and talent for their member companies. By first entering the internship market at their home school and now others, they’ll be able to expand to the larger career market.These skills include how to stand up and deliver a presentation, how to network, knowing when and how to ask for help, how to write well, developing a following, and becoming fluent with numbers.The saddest presentations I see are decks for theoretical businesses.

We were done. After ten amazing pitches, we all stood together on stage, celebrating the end of the Barclays Accelerator Spring 2015 Program in front of over 400 people. This was the end of three incredible months that changed my life for the better. But let’s go back to the beginning.About 18 months earlier, l rejected offers from two well known MBA programs. A two year opportunity to give my life a new and heavily needed trajectory, after being no longer happy with my professional career for a long time.Instead, I decided to do what just felt right. I I knew entrepreneurship should be my new playground and a mentor gave me the next idea: Join Techstars as an Associate. One introduction and a personal meeting in London later, I was offered to come onboard the In March, I met all the Startups, Associates and team members who would become my family for the time ahead. It didn’t take long and the program took off and with it, our jobs as Associates to add as much value as possible to the teams with our skills and experience.During your time as an Associate you get the chance to build great connections with mentors, help the teams in any area you are interested in, attend amazing masterclasses and learn how to tell a compelling story.I worked with the startups on anything around Business Development including Business Models, Customer Development, Sales Pipelines and Digital Marketing. On top, I had the pleasure to get deep insights into the operations of the program.Looking back, I realized that, skipping the typical MBA for this program was the perfect choice to prepare myself for my new playground — The Startup Ecosystem. But let me also tell you why:When you work with ten smart and driven startups for three months, you definitely learn one thing: how to solve our biggest problems and build a successful business around it.Most MBA programs focus on turning corporate soldiers into corporate officers and managing an existing business as good as possible. While these are valuable skill for work in a global corporation, it does not prepare you to start your company from scratch.While growing a company is hard, there are tried and tested methods that work and you’ll learn them at Techstars. This can not give you a guaranteed success, but it can increase your chances and make sure you avoid mistakes others have done before.During my time in the business, I learned that books, lectures and case studies can only take you so far. At Techstars, the startups constantly deal with real customers, real products and a real ping pong table to recover from all of that, and so do you as an Associate.While case studies are usually based on real problems, they cannot take into account the dynamic and complexity of a running business. It is one thing to come up with the perfect solution on paper, but once you are facing real business, things change.At Techstars, many experienced mentors support you in handling the real life and you can tap into their knowledge every day. When your goal is to build a company, this is the perfect setup to get you used to reality.One of the most valuable assets of an MBA is the alumni network. It gives you easy access to new contacts that can speed up your career. But those contacts can turn out to be just like you — the BizDevs of the world.A network of consultants, bankers and corporate managers can be a great asset, but if you are reading this right now, it might not be the right one for you. For a startup career, you want to look into a different direction.Techstars’ global network of founders and mentors is a diverse network of amazing people who devote themselves to building great companies and supporting startup communities around the world. If you feel that startup spirit inside you, that is the network you want to join.I believe that the best investments you can make are the ones into your own skills, experience and knowledge. They stay with your forever and make your life worth living. But they also need to pay off at some point down the line.Getting a well recognized MBA today comes with a major investment, due to the high tuition fees and a long time with no regular income. With a fatal result for many graduates who make the payback a priority for their career.When you join Techstars as an Associate you get a guaranteed positive lifetime return. All you have to invest is your time, energy and knowledge. With the provided stipend, you can easily bootstrap your life for the duration of the program and get the experience you desire.When I read Philip Broughton’s experience of an The student asked „Why are you treating me like this? I’m the customer.“ And all the staff member replied was „No, you’re not. You are the product.“In this family, paying it forward is taken seriously. I had the pleasure of experiencing that myself several times. And like in every family, there will be good and though times. But in the end all its members will support you and embrace you for who you are.So no matter if you want to change your career from corporate to startup, prepare yourself for your own startup or just have an amazing three months full of new experiences and contacts: Business Developer | Innovation Facilitator | From Corporate to Solopreneurship 

I still vividly remember July 28th, 2014. It was a dusty summer afternoon in Marrakech. My co-founder and I were hiding from the scolding heat and resting on a traditional Moroccan sofa, and I tentatively clicked on Mailchimp’s “send now” button to officially launch More and more digital nomads move to “Al-Maghreb” to enjoy great weather, good infrastructure, fantastic food, and low prices. The country’s present is deeply interlaced with its history, and when not sitting by a computer, one can visit and marvel at one of the world’s most extraordinary wonders. Night strolling through Jamaa al Fna square in the old city of Marrakech, sipping mint tea in pleasantly refreshing shade of a quaint riad, or talking to the few remaining Berber inhabitants of mud-brick kasbahs in Ouarzazate will bring you several centuries back in time. Enchanting Morocco has always irresistibly attracted various explorers and today tech entrepreneurs are on the hook as well.In May this year, we came back as a part of our tour of 12 emerging countries, this time only for a few weeks, but with our program packed more than ever. As the country is over 2000 km long, we spent countless hours in our fabulous pink rental car, moving between Marrakech, Rabat, Essaouira, Agadir, Taghazout, and Casablanca. And in the meantime, we replaced Lebanese shawarma, hommos, and tabbouleh for Moroccan tajine, zaalouk, and couscous. Adil is vegetarian and I am not a big meat eater either, but since we started our travels in Arab countries, we’ve gotten overloaded with proteins. In Our first workshop brought us to Rabat, a very organized and European looking capital, to meet startup founders and business owners brought together by When we reached Essaouira, a city popular with kite surfers due to its windy climate and backpackers due to its availability of hashish, we got in touch with Aline Mayard, editor of the Middle Eastern magazine for entrepreneurs Before reaching Agadir, we got an invitation to come back to Marrakech and talk to the members of Although I was on antibiotics and Adil was exhausted by the never-ending driving, we were quickly captivated by the vibrant atmosphere and high expectations of the attendees. The product development stage and overall presentations of the startups that took part in the pitch competition were at an extremely high level. It was hard to choose one single favorite. We saw a safe car-pooling solution, an innovative alternative to Groupon for restaurants, or a disruptive advertising model for mobile phones, among others. Some of the startups have already expanded internationally, grown a significant user base, and secured remarkable seed funding. Our own time on stage felt so short when we tried to explain the power of technology and its ability to enable entrepreneurship all around the globe. Yet, many of the participants came to chat with us afterwards because they felt inspired by the idea, so in the end we were leaving the event motivated to keep spreading the message.Well, as far as technology goes, our last day in Morocco let us experience an unexpected and unbelievable kick in the teeth. As we took a taxi to the airport, Adil noticed that the clock in the car shows a different time than our iPhones. We double-checked online and stayed calm until we got off and asked a random passerby. He checked his wristwatch and confirmed that we’re one hour late, which meant the check-in counter had already been closed. Since it was June already, our first though was that for some mysterious reason, possibly Ramadan approaching, Morocco changed the time the previous night, without us having noticed. But as we observed more and more confused and desperate travellers running left and right, and after deeper investigation, it was clear that the mistake was done by “the internet”. The Moroccan summer time change was in fact supposed to happen the next day, but all the smartphones displayed the different time a whole day earlier. Yes, for the whole day, Google would show a wrong time for the entire country. This is a true story.

Behind the veil of every thriving startup lies an entrepreneurial-minded product manager who aids founders in assembling an awesome team, capitalizing on product-market fit, scaling growth and more. Product management is an art and profession all its own, and founders who try to oversee product development while juggling other aspects of a growing company will eventually reach a tipping point.This doesn’t mean CEOs Here’s why you need a product manager to spearhead your product development:We all know the stereotypical visionary CEO: high on dreams and often low on reality. This type of CEO can switch gears quickly and leave others wondering what to work on.A good product manager acts as a buffer between the CEO and the team. She will hear the vision and translate that into actual non-vanity metrics that will grow the company. She will set the right goals for the team to reach the CEO’s vision that you may never have considered.Most importantly, she’ll be honest about feasibility and the pace of innovation. Every CEO wants the world changed yesterday. A PM will keep your team on track, knowing that every incremental change will contribute to the final vision.Founders of fast-growing companies are strapped for time. They need to hire excellent talent, manage culture, craft the strategy, handle press, secure funding and more. The faster and more disruptive a company, the more easily a CEO’s focus can be pulled away from the product.This is where a great PM steps in. In many ways, a PM acts as a mini-CEO. She understands the vision but doesn’t get bogged down by sales, financials or regulations. She can zero in on building an innovative product that solves real customer problems.Nontechnical founders often underestimate the difficulty in managing and communicating with engineers, rallying their team around a common goal and executing.Product managers aren’t just technical, though. The best PMs also know how to work with people — and get the best work out of the team. They create space for everyone to be heard — from customers to engineers and the CEO — and can impart their experiences with product culture to others. And because skilled PMs can motivate and reward employees, your team will feel empowered and challenged to take your company to new heights.PMs are in a better position to manage the product development team than leaders who are stretched in every direction. But to make this dynamic work, you have to hand over real ownership of the product. That doesn’t mean you should step aside, though. By setting up regular review meetings, you can stay up to date on progress and learning and provide feedback.Never forget that the PM’s job largely revolves around communication — not making key decisions — so the entire team should be responsible for successes and failures.Maybe you’ve reached a point where your attention is too divided. Don’t let your product suffer as a result. Search for a capable product manager who can help take your product to the next level, and you won’t regret it.They call me ‘The Wolf’.

While traveling with VC4Africa recorded over $26 million invested in startups in 2014 and this year alone, we have seen companies like After talking to many entrepreneurs, investors and government officials across the continent I have come to believe that the problem much rather lies in the relative illiquidity of the available capital rather than in the amount itself.In easier words: It is too complicated, risky and burdensome to invest capital in startups which results in long due diligence processes, unhappy stakeholders and the impression that there is not enough money for entrepreneurs. This ultimately creates two problems: Entrepreneurs are left with little to no investment and investors are stuck with funds they can’t spend. There are a few reasons for this:VCs and Angels are still relatively few compared to the number of entrepreneurs looking for funding. This means that there is no fierce competition among investors, which gives them more negotiating power while fundraising and in turn drags out the decision making process and puts downward pressure on valuation.Wealthy people still prefer to invest in traditional industries such as oil and gas or real estate. These are industries that provide mediocre, but stable returns which is why people chose those instead of more risky, but also potentially more rewarding opportunities such as startups and entrepreneursEvery investor has a different due diligence process that requires startups to invest a lot of time and energy into providing different information to different investors to comply with their request. This means that a due diligence process can take anything from weeks to months. Lastly, even when an investment offer is made, every investor uses different term sheets, making it hard for entrepreneurs to compare different offers and decide for what’s best for themFrom my experience, these are the main factors that make fundraising for African entrepreneurs incredibly time consuming and frustrating and create the impression that there is a lack of money on the continent. But it doesn’t have to be that way:To see how it can be done differently, we can have a look at Silicon Valley. Fundraising in Silicon Valley is a highly competitive sport for VCs, who consistently fight over being part of the best deals in the valley. This competition reduces time from pitch to term sheet to about half a day and to money in the bank to maybe a week, making it incredibly easy for founders to access the available capital in an efficient way. In addition, the legal and tax framework for investments is relatively clear in the US, removing ambiguity and risk from the process and increasing willingness to invest. Lastly, both entrepreneurs and investors have a longer track record and experience in fundraising and are therefore much more professional, using standard term sheets, contracts and legal structures that have shown to be best practice for a number of years.I am not saying that we don’t need more investor money for African startups but I believe we need to change the way investments are made and make the process easier, faster and more standardized before we can even handle more money. Right now the bottleneck is not the amount of money, but the process with which it is invested. The best way to get there, is educating investors, governments, corporates and entrepreneurs. Let’s fix this first before calling for more money we can’t even invest.Thoughts on innovation, technology  Startup ecosystems| Regional Manager Africa 

I know that this may come as a surprise, but I get a bunch of questions from folks. Like “You’ve been writing about the Portland startup scene for almost a decade. How is it that you’ve never learned how to use the English language?” And “What do you actually do?” And “A beard? Really?” But one question I get more often than any other is “How do I get involved in the Portland startup scene?”So I usually tell them.But then it dawned on me: So without further ado, here’s your no muss, no fuss way to quickly connect with a bunch of other folks who love startups, love Portland, and will probably love you too.For whatever reason, folks keep coming back here to read stuff that I write. As such, I feel an incredible amount of pressure… err motivation to keep this side project going. And to keep sharing interesting stuff with you awesome people. So please, keep reading.If you’re a real glutton for punishment, you can I’d also recommend following This generation of Portland startups was really born out of the already amazing open source scene we had going here in town. And user groups sprinkled here, there, and everywhere in Portland. As such, we’re really into collaborating and informing folks about what’s going on.A while back a small cadre of open source types decided that searching multiple event sites wasn’t the best user experience. So they built So if you’re in Portland — or happen to just be visiting Portland from time to time — this is the very best spot to figure out what’s happening when. It’s the go to site for Portland events. Full stop.Like many startup scenes, Portland is collaborative and collegial. We like to help one another out. We know we’re all in this together. And nothing more exemplifies that than the Built by Portland startup Portland Startups Switchboard has organically become a great landing pad for folks who have just moved to Portland — or those who are still considering the Rose City as their next opportunity.In the early days of this generation of Portland startups, the Portland startup scene connected using a product from a relatively young startup called Twitter. It was mostly geeky folks on the platform back then. And it proved to be an easy and straightforward way for all of us to share things and stay in touch.Obviously, times have changed. But recently, I’ve had the luck to be part of a number of public Slack channels. And as I used them more and more, I’ll be damned if I wasn’t reminded of the early days of Twitter. Which made me think, what if we tried to recreate that magic from the early days of the Portland startup scene?It’s still early. But it just might work. So whether you’re in the Portland startup scene or purely curious about the Portland startup scene from near or far, come join us in the One of the most confusing things to recent transplants is the lack of “must attend” events and established networking infrastructure here in Portland. It seems like a negative, but it’s actually an indicator of what makes Portland great: Yes, there is still the problem of “I don’t even know who I’m supposed to meet.” And events are definitely a great way for that to happen. For that, see 1–4 above. But admittedly we still probably need to fix that “big generic meetup” thing that Beer and Blog used to satisfy.Anyway, if there is someone in town you’d like to meet? Just email them. Or ping them on Twitter. Or hit them up on Slack. Or whatever. Reach out. Most every startup CEO in town blocks time on their calendar for these sorts of happenstance and serendipitous meetings. So just ask.There you go. Five steps for how to Portland startup scene.

Back to 2012. We were fresh graduates. We were ready to start our professional lives, but craving for something new and different. Outside of the box, we said. That’s how it happened. Thomas  Brice, soon joined by Edgar, decided to create a non-profit organisation: Now, the three of us launched First reason, travelling the world gave us a positive mindset to start our own company.Both travelling and entrepreneurship keep you out of your comfort zone. You don’t get habits anywhere, anytime. And when you start feeling at home, you have to move forward to the next country or to the next idea. If you don’t, you are late regarding your schedule and your deadlines.Meanwhile, when exploring the world, you constantly adapt yourself to the country you visit. You get used to meeting and interacting with different kinds of people. You do not talk to a Brazilian person the same way you ask something to a Japanese one. In a startup, you will handle different kinds of conversation whether you speak to a lawyer, a customer or your developer. You are flexible. You feel comfortable in addressing different kinds of people.The trip will also give you a taste of freedom you will never be willing to loose. Of course, tasks and deadlines drove our project. Organizing meetings, editing videos and publishing content were part of the game. But it was our own choice, with both positive and negative aspects. We chose the way we managed it, giving the best out of us. We follow the exact same path creating Second reason. You will be glad you ran another project before you start your own company. You already know how to overcome many difficulties and the way you work is far more productive.When we created the The three of us also decided to keep on working together. It was a huge advantage to start again with the same founders: who is doing what and which tools we should use. We already knew all the processes to set up and the way we should interact. When you travel with someone, you discover both someone’s qualities and defaults. We had these cards in the hand when we started and took it as a huge competitive advantage.We decided to run a serious project while travelling the world and it might have been the best decision we took so far. Of course, it required some preparation before the journey and some work during the trip. On the other side, it gave us access to a large range of people in different countries.First, you get use to be in contact with people and feel more comfortable to ask for something: time, help and advice. And people usually agree to help a non-profit, young and entrepreneur-friendly project. This might be the first step in building a community around you and your ideas. And that’s what we did with Our community is also global. As W Project teams visited more than 30 countries today, we can rely on a huge and global network, but also target specific places if we need to.We were able to run a first project during two years. New people keep on running it every year. The community and the impact we have are far more meaningful. And people can see it. They feel more confident about our projects and even if they don’t believe in the idea, the team might be worth it after all. And you know how essential a team is in a startup project.Regarding Finally, being in contact with so many entrepreneurs gave us a really good panel of the different way we could start and run a company. People told us about both their mistakes and best practices. They shared their mindsets and beliefs with us. We felt the motivation and the inspiration while listening to all these amazing experiences. And we are more ready now than ever.Of course, travelling the world is not a requirement to set up a company. Let’s take it as a good way of opening minds, living thriving experiences and running your own projects. 

Full of opportunity, but chaos nonetheless.In the days of old, people with cred or tech would raise some seed funding, get a team together and do some product development, then promptly proceed to raise a $4–8 Series A from a couple of reputable venture firms for a measly 40% of their company (who cares about dilution when you’re building a billion dollar business, right ?).Then, of course, all hell broke lose. Enter YC and the Do More with Less mentality. Lean is In. What can In the meantime of course, the top of the VC pyramid is shrinking. FLAG, based on its own research, indicated an estimate of only 100 active full lifecycle venture firms in the US (there are over 800 on the NVCA website). You don’t need to be a genius to build a theme called Series A Crunch (complete with cereal packet).So here’s what’s happening on the funding side:The old and convenient distinction between Seed and Series A has gone out the window. The current market overhang is partly cyclical, partly structural (we’re breaking new ground with the likes of Angellist) and it’s hard to determine which is which when markets are evolving this fast.Incubator X Demo Day is a glorious celebration, which is as it should be. Everyone is high fiving the great pitches , basking in the glory of their two line coverage on Techcrunch and generally feeling like the world is their oyster. As we all know, all a seed funding or a run inside Techstars can do is give you a shot at getting that MVP out in decent conditions. No more, no less.The reality is as follows:The bar has been raised: better entrepreneurs, businesses that scale faster.

This post first appeared on As a startup marketing exec that has been through a large number of product launches, I believe that how you position your startup in the market is crucial to early startup success. I’ve also seen that very few startups have a firm grasp of what exactly positioning is, why it’s important and how to do it.The concept of positioning was first described by Ries and Trout in their marketing classic Fast-forward 40 years — is the concept of Positioning still relevant? One could argue that it is more relevant than ever before. When Ries and Trout were stating that we were being bombarded with advertising messages, it turned out we were only getting started. Not only were the number of ads used in traditional media ballooning, the internet hadn’t even happened yet. If it was hard to be heard back then, it is almost impossible now.Here’s what it isn’t — it isn’t a tag line, it isn’t messaging, it isn’t your vision statement, it isn’t an elevator pitch. Although all of those things use Positioning as a foundation, positioning is something different. Here’s my definition:So if positioning is so important, how do we do it? Traditionally marketing schools have taught us to capture positioning in a “positioning statement”. This statement usually comes in a form that looks something like this:Here’s an example that’s been used in almost every marketing class I’ve ever taken that touched on Positioning: the positioning statement for Amazon from 2001:This tells us a lot about Amazon’s business (back then). The target market was book readers who are on the net, their competition were traditional book sellers, their differentiating feature was the broad selection of books and the value was giving you easy access to that selection at a low price. That’s a load of info about a business in one simple statement.I always felt we could do better than this, especially for technology startups. I appreciate the idea of bringing together a bunch of really important ideas (what market are you in, what is the key benefit you deliver, what makes your offering different, who are your competitors) in as succinct a way as possible. Bringing that all together into one sentence forces you to be really simplify the things that make up your position in the market. On the other hand, forcing this into one pseudo-grammatically correct phrase (or phrases) often results in a statement that is not only awkward to say (let alone memorize) but forces the key elements into a random order that doesn’t necessarily lead to a path of further exploration. In my opinion, the Positioning Statement although short and sweet, is not helping us figure out positioning.In my opinion a better way to capture positioning would be to bring the elements together into something that I could stick on the wall and refer to often. I’ve usually used a “canvas” — like structure to capture positioning that looks something like this:The boxes are pretty simple. Here’s what I mean by each one:Now here’s where this type of positioning exercise gets interesting. If you lay it out this way you can experiment changing something in one box and then watching how it impacts the other boxes. In my experience, changing something as simple as the definition of the market you are in or the segments you are going after can result in a dramatically stronger positioning.Here’s an example. I worked for a startup that had a database product. The key differentiator for this product was that it allowed companies to very quickly analyze a large amount of data. The result was that queries that used to take hours could be run in minutes. The target market was essentially any company with a large amount of data that needed to be analyzed.The main problem with this positioning was the market category. When we opened sales meetings with “We are a database” the prospect would immediately say “Ah, sorry, we’re an Oracle shop, we can’t bring in another database platform.” By positioning ourselves in a very established market category, we had essentially set Oracle as our competition in the minds of our prospects and had to spend the first meeting undoing the perception that we were essentially a crappy Oracle.But we WERE a database. What else could we be? The answer came from a prospect in the end. At the end of a difficult sales call a prospect said to us “Ah! I finally get what you are!” To which I responded, “Um, like what are we?” He says “You aren’t a database at all you’re a data warehouse!”At the time this technically didn’t seem to be true. Data Warehouses back then were defined by specific features/structures (e.g. star schemas, cubes) designed to speed up analytic queries. We were already a very fast database for analytic queries. So in terms of the value we brought to customers, we were very much a data warehouse. Better yet, by repositioning ourselves as a warehouse, we completely changed the vendors we were compared to. Our new competitors were less established and our technology was clearly different from theirs. By changing our market frame of reference, we went from weak positioning to strong positioning.At other startups I have been part of we pivoted on the target customer by either focusing down on a smaller niche segment, by focusing on a vertical or by focusing on a different buyer (for example a line of business buyer rather than a technical buyer).The point here is that once you have the positioning clearly laid out you can see where the weak points potentially are and then experiment to see if there is a way to position yourself more strongly in a different market or to different buyers.(Hey you made it this far, awesome — please hit the recommend button below!)I do startup marketing and sales. I’ve grown companies from zero to hundreds of millions in revenue. 

Cap tables are the bones of startups, which explains why they are often broken.To avoid the problem, here is info and tools that have worked for me:For early stage startups at the 3Fs stage (founders, friends and family), it’s normally enough to maintain an excel spreadsheet. The Board of Directors can authorize uncertificated shares, saving on costs early on.Here is a link to a publicly available “simple” cap table I would recommend: Use a pro forma cap table when fund raising. Pro forma in Latin means “according to form”. Of course, in fundraising it describes a method of calculating current versus projected (i.e. pre- and post-) stock holdings.Here is a link: Note that excel cap tables do not do a good job accounting for convertible notes or SAFEs unless those are considered converted. Excel cap tables are also limited in displaying liquidation preferences.Fear not, as this Use an electronic cap maintenance system once there are outside the 3Fs shareholders (e.g., angel investors). Previously law firms were resigned to handle stock certificates and capitalization maintenance (and hated it — it’s not easy to get perfect).Today, I help tech growth startups close business development, revenue and partnership deals.

Premature scaling on any of the dimension kills 74% of startups as per a research done on 3200 startups under the The rules of the game are no different for On Demand startups. For the uninitiated, On Demand marketplace based platforms have been challenging the status quo by disrupting established industry value chains across many verticals. The platforms make the connection between buyers and sellers, consumers and service providers, etc. by bringing the information required for an offline transactional exchange online. Owing to the offline and online elements scaling these platforms can be an operational nightmare. But startups like Airbnb, Uber, Didi Kuaidi, Instacart etc. have come out of the shell and have become the unicorns in the business world. Every on demand startup has the potential to grow as big as them.Let’s try to analyze the challenges and explore some best practices for new initiatives looking to scale. I have structured this discussion as a four part series with each post concentrating on one of the dimension talked about earlier.On Demand Marketplace generally serves 2 or more customer sets or stakeholders that need to work together. This happens to be the biggest challenge for any On Demand Marketplace.The first thing to decide in this regard is to figure out where to start working — demand side or supply side. As a rule of thumb, seeding the marketplace by providing a minimum guarantee to the initial contractors is a good strategy. Even if the ultimate goal is to aggregate and loosely associate with the supply; partly owning the supply gives you more control on the service quality. In addition if the supply side shows symptoms of underutilization, it is easier to sell the value proposition to them by promising additional demand, viz. a viz., the demand side for your area of operation.“Liquidity is a stage when marketplace reaches self-sustaining viability.” On Demand Marketplaces are generally characterized by network effects.Let’s take Uber’s example — From the demand perspective, Uber needs to ensure that they are able to create a reliable system characterized by taxis being available at any time of the day with ETA’s below a given threshold. While the supply needs to be promised above a certain threshold to ensure that they see a lot of value through additional revenue. Knowing these thresholds, we can calculate the demand and supply required to reach the critical mass in a certain geographic area.Start small suggestion is associated with ensuring that these demand and supply targets are kept to a minimum. One way of doing this is starting with a smaller service/operation area. Another important consideration will be to keep the focus area constrained or in other words ensure the razor sharp focus on a certain vertical (products/services) and adding related demand and supply side demographics slowly.Related reading — For a more mathematical approach to this problem, that talks about You are trying to provide a more efficient platform for doing certain type of transactions. This basically implies that these transactions are already happening albeit with a lot of friction involved. So invariably there is an avenue to tap either on the supply or on the demand side. Identification of such opportunities can help in the initial growth. AirBnB did this by piggy backing on Craigslist’s demand. It doesn’t always need to be this fancy though. For instance, a platform providing A to B rides can identify the places with maximum demand (airports, bus stops, taxi stands, etc.) in order to find the initial power users.Any discussion on acquisition has to begin with absolute clarity on the pain point that you are solving for both the demand and supply side. As long as the pain points are substantial there will always be users interested in your platform. We have already established some ways to solve the initial chicken and egg problem, let’s take a step further to explore the general demand acquisition channels.It’s important to remember that there is a fundamental difference between the demand acquisition approach for On Demand platforms as compared to other technology based startups. Digital marketing with all its related channels — content marketing, paid marketing, SEM and social media needs a completely different orientation with focus on local searches, forums where users from a certain area frequent and so on. While this can give you a certain number of users the approach is limited in its ability to guarantee success. So in addition to these channels some other fruitful channels will be –This happen to be a carry forward from our discussion in the previous section. Owing to the local orientation of marketing, an FOS (Feet on Street) team placed strategically in areas where the traditional means of transaction take place can provide the maximum ROI. Clubbing this with promotional offers can often help in creating a sizable pool of highly engaged users.Convenience, quality and cost — trifecta that can never be expected together according to traditional wisdom is brought together by many of the On Demand platforms. While convenience comes with the ability to tap a button to summon the products and services at your place, quality is baked into the platform with in-built feedback loops based on the review systems. When it comes to cost — the fact that these platforms bring the underutilized assets into play, continuously evolving technology capabilities reducing the operational costs and bullishness of investors ensures that on demand service is no longer a premium.What I Want, When I Want, How I Want It (WIWWIWHIWI) nature is thus the best lever to open the taps for new users coming on to the platform. Referral loops often account for 30–50% of new downloads. Optimizing this loop can thus be the most significant channel for demand side acquisition.Related viewing — Taking a cue directly from Uber’s user acquisition strategy, “accelerants” defined as an event that leads to a greater demand of the said product/service is a great way of acquiring new users. Uber identified weather, sports, restaurants and nightlife as accelerants that dramatically boost their growth, sometimes doubling the virality.These accelerants where the existing infrastructure becomes even more shaky or your value proposition shines through can be used as a cue for positioning the product.Related reading — If you are not going too niche with your implementation you can always identify complimentary local brands that constantly attract your biggest target market.Although not strictly a way of getting new users, but a user retained is a user gained. Its an established fact that its always cheaper to get more transactions from the existing user base than to invest in new user acquisition. Same holds true for On Demand platforms as well. From all the secondary data that I have come across, LTV (Lifetime Value of Users) numbers when compared to a single transaction value are generally high for these platforms owing to the value they bring to the users.Marketing automation helps build relationships with your customers via segmenting them according to their behavioural interaction with the platform. Tools of the trade include multi-channel delivery of promotional messages, automatic triggers, intelligent personalised messaging campaigns etc.Hope above mentioned points will help you gain traction as you get more users for your startup.Powering On Demand AppsUber for X is the phenomena wherein a platform aggregates/generates demand on mobile devices which is then fulfilled by offline service providers. Also known as an On Demand Service, these platforms employ a full cycle approach to provide end to end convenience to the customer.

I’ve wanted to discuss this topic for some time and finally the inspiration for this came from a post on Reddit called, When non-founders ask me to describe what it’s like running a startup it can be summed up in one phrase, ‘emotional roller coaster’. There are a lot of components involved in running a startup ranging from vision, fundraising, product, sales, marketing, legal, etc.Here is an example that I had to deal with in January. After more than a dozen emails back and forth I was able to get an in person meeting with investor Prior to starting GamerBet I wouldn’t have described myself as someone who had dealt with depression but since starting it has felt like I’ve struggle with times of depression. You might ask, how can someone become depressed from running a startup? Well as a founder I’m responsible for everything that happens. This includes the stuff most people will argue isn’t my fault but ultimately there is no one to blame but yourself as a founder. There are three other co-founders(Collin, Phil  Sabrina) and every day I’m one decision away from failing and or letting them down. Now let me ask you, who wouldn’t get a little messed up from that? The amount of pressure on your shoulders day to day is extreme.The video above shows what had been accomplished in a weekend. There’s no excuse to not have something in place before quitting your job. If you’re unable to find the time, passion or drive to work your normal 9–5 job and then work from 7–12 on your startup I’m not sure quitting your job is the right choice.I have a strong opinion that Founding a company requires you to be able to take a step back and be realistic with yourself because you’re going to need to know what your strengths and weaknesses are in order to build the company. Personally I’m able to take a step back from myself to know that I would struggle running any startup without a co-founder because I have very little self motivation but instead I am driven by the guilt factor of knowing that I’m letting my co-founder(s) down.I’ve had the pleasure to work with many brilliant developers over the last +5 years but honestly only 3 have ever came across my mind as being solo founder material. The reason there is such a difference is that there’s a lot of developers that in my opinion would be absolute garbage when it comes to running a company because they have not spent the time developing their business skills.The statement that is usually used to argue out that my point above is invalid is something along the lines of, ‘If I build a great product the customers will come’. There’s many developers who have built amazing products that nobody know about, that have a terrible business model and are more in line with a side project than building a startup.CEO of Everything Around Startups

We disclosed the bugs responsibly to the top execs of the respective startups. Some of the startups acted swiftly, others needed multiple emails but unfortunately, some did not reply even after repeated emails, putting sensitive user data and some VC money at risk. Some of the bugs were somewhat trivial and any decent engineer can get your personal data and sell it to brokers in the grey market.This post is to draw the attention of companies who have still not responded. Maybe social media can help. To be clear, we just discovered existing security vulnerabilities and informed the companies involved. We did not try or intrude into anyone’s external or internal systems.We could not check all startups for bugs due to a shortage of time. We included startups who have raised more than $10 million or are worth more than $100 million. In the context of India, $100 million is a lot of money since the biggest startup acquisition that has happened in India was of Most of the bugs were logic flaws which ideally should have been caught at the whiteboard stage. These cannot be detected using automated vulnerability scanners that can work for stuff like We checked 18 startups for security vulnerabilities. Out of these, we discovered bugs in 11. The most serious among them was user data leak which happened in 5 of them for a total of around 2,650,000 users. The leaked data included addresses, phone numbers, emails, order history and surprisingly, unsalted password hashes in two of them. There were bugs related to online payments in four of them due to which we could order some test stuff from all of the startups. There were authentication issues in two startups, one in the way social login were implemented and other in the implementation of OTPs leading to access to anyone’s account if you know their email address. One startup probably had an HTML sanitization code that did not work on recursive XSS test strings leading to the Nginx server forever waiting for the application server to respond until the timeout kicked in. This can be exploited to bring down the server with some effort. There was a reflected XSS on a desktop version of website of a startup which could be exploited for example by sending an email containing some offer code and asking them to login on the link on the startup’s domain that looks exactly similar as login page and get their passwords. Some mobile browsers have even stopped showing the full URL and this would help the purpose.We are also investigating a potential bug in a payment gateway provider that is used as one way to process online payments by almost all Indian startups.We make startups secure.

A lot is written about Hong Kong as a startup ecosystem, but one thing is for sure: a working visa isn’t a breakpoint (anymore)!As startup mentor and as co-director of the Founder Institute in Hong Kong, I often get questions from founders about working visas in Hong Kong and I did my share of visa applications for staff so far (6 applications, 100% hit rate). So when I got a meeting invitation (hat tip to The meeting was on knowledge migration working visas in Hong Kong and especially the new The official name of the category is “Start-up Business” and is setup especially for entrepreneurs. (“founders” is still not a term in the Big Dictionary of Immigration Departments) The scheme is open for applications as of 4th May 2015.The reasons for having that category is: (directly from the slide)So this means that startup founders can apply for a startup business visa if their startup is “vetted” (read: accepted) by one of the 5 government backed initiatives in Hong Kong.To be favourably considered in your application, your startup have to be accepted in one of these 5 programmes:Startups “vetted” by other programmes can apply on a case to case basis. So if your startup is accepted in for example Persons eligible under the “Start-up Business” category are:This is with “no limit on the total amount”.

I’ve been the CTO at Zymergen for a bit over a year now. When I started at Zymergen, my formal training in biology amounted to a high school class I had taken 15 years ago. I hadn’t thought seriously about the area since. I have a lot of computer science training (both schooling and industry), and have focused in particular on making Big Data technology work. But I was essentially clueless when it came to biology.By way of some background: in a nutshell, Zymergen makes microbes that make chemicals. The chemical production process is called Naturally, you might think that all of this requires a hefty dose of biology. And you’d be right — our success is contingent on a staff of world-class microbiologists who are deep in the genetic code and other specifics of esoteric bacteria and other microbes.One of the things I’ve learned is that all of these individuals are incredibly deep in a specific focus within the broader domain of biology, but Zymergen has brought together biologists, chemists, statisticians, computer scientists, and automation experts.This meeting of the minds has resulted in incredible advances in our ability to perform the work of bioengineering. Most genetic engineering done elsewhere on microbes is done by hand: pipetting one (or perhaps 8 or 12) vials of liquid at a time into another, over and over, to mix the requisite DNA primers, cells, and other samples to effect a single genetic mutation.At Zymergen, we have industrialized the process: liquid handling robots, computerized workflows and data capture systems, and algorithmic DNA searches can methodically and inexpensively optimize genome performance at a scale not reached just a few years ago.This is a novel capability, and one that would never be accomplished — or even articulated in a meaningful way — without bringing together a variety of experts with diverse backgrounds.Before Zymergen, I spent 6 years working in enterprise software. The last few years were spent building machine learning systems for online retail. While the technical challenges were interesting, and my coworkers were smart, gifted people, I couldn’t help but feel like something was missing. As Jeff Hammerbacher once said, The promise of industrial fermentation means less dependence on oil; creating chemicals (of which we as a society need a whole lot) from renewable agricultural resources. In addition to this mission of sustainability, at Zymergen you get to literally see the future being invented. Building out a robotic lab and automating what was once a manual process is like watching the 21st century equivalent of the industrial revolution unfold before your eyes, at Internet speed. And it’s tangible: at the end of the day, I know my work has value to people because I can see their work happening faster, and I can see — and am learning to understand — their results as well.Zymergen has a culture of collaboration, of learning, of autonomy, and mastery. When I joined I was nervous about how little biology I understood. I’ve learned more in one year sitting next to these professional biologists than I would in any class. By the same token, they rely on me and the software engineering team to provide them with data-driven tools that none of them could design or build on their own.I couldn’t ask for a better place to work. If any of this resonates with you, we’d love to have you with us — see our open roles at 

Essa é a segunda pergunta mais recorrente ao adentrar no mundo das Startups, a primeira ainda é: Por que eu não pensei nisso antes?Durante muito tempo assumimos a máxima de que o único propósito de qualquer empresa é gerar retorno a seus acionistas. Com o passar do tempo esse conceito foi mudando, mas nunca deixou de ser. Adquirimos responsabilidades e compromissos que diminuem o retorno dos acionistas a curto prazo e que garantem a médio/longo prazo estabilidade na cadeia produtiva de uma empresa. É o caso de investimentos em sustentabilidade, por exemplo.Quando falamos em Startup, aquela fase onde as empresas, ou projeto delas, estão pensando no desenvolvimento da tecnologia ou do processo, é possível ver a presença de soluções inovadoras, porém, pouca estrutura ou visão de negócio sustentando elas. Em outras palavras, há a preocupação de atender a necessidade proposta pela empresa, sem necessariamente apresentar retorno imediato, ou melhor, o dinheiro passa a ser consequência.Sim, eu sei que isso confunde nossa mente programada para o lucro e o retorno sobre qualquer investimento. Mesmo eu, que tenho a mente aberta, criativa e propensa a inovação, precisei de algumas imersões mais profundas para entender a engrenagem. O que de fato não deixa de ser curioso, vou tentar esmiuçar um pouco esse conceito.Para tal, talvez seja preciso voltar um pouco na história. O homem descobriu a produção, que descobriu a troca de produtos (escambo), que criou uma moeda de troca, que passou a vender serviços, que industrializou os produtos, que modernizou processos, que inventou tecnologias, que permitiu o surgimento de novas estruturas de negócios, como o Orkut, Twitter, Facebook que aparentemente não vendem um produto, mas agregam serviços e convergências. Bem resumidão para poder seguir o pensamento…A ideia do “free” já foi bem discutida no mundo da economia. Entregar um produto gratuito para o usuário e buscar a rentabilidade através de outras plataformas e serviços em outra ponta já é uma realidade presente na nossa forma de pensar uma empresa e, basicamente, as startups baseiam-se nesse conceito para desenvolverem seus produtos/tecnologia. Até aqui, nenhuma grande novidade.O ponto é que as empresas, à partir de grandes aquisições e fusões, passaram a ter muito valor agregado a marcas e a capacidade de inteligência sobre as bases de dados. E é isso que normalmente uma Startup vende, a promessa de ser e se tornar “vendável”, seja fruto de sua base, seja por se tornar uma ferramenta indispensável para o usuário.O que estou dizendo é que não precisa mais ser vendido um produto ou um serviço para que se gere valor. E fica cada vez mais difícil buscar formas de alcançar receitas. É possível, inclusive, encontrar empresas que permitem a troca de produtos e serviços sem envolver nenhuma moeda na transação. Mas calma, não voltamos à Idade Média…O que muitas Startups vendem é uma base de dados rica de informações. Essa base está perdendo valor com o tempo, explico. Ao olhar para o usuário, podemos presumir que ele não utiliza apenas uma plataforma ou uma rede isolada. As informações se repetem e quanto mais empresas, aplicativos, softwares como serviço atenderem o mesmo nicho de usuários, mais comum serão as bases de informações. Quando algo se torna comum, ele perde valor, vira commodity e perde o diferencial.O fato é que muitas empresas não sabem bem lidar com a base de dados que possui, tudo isso é ainda muito novo e entendível, todos estão descobrindo juntos. Sendo assim, o que de fato as empresas e investidores estão interessados não é apenas uma base de usuário.Quando pensamos nos modelos tradicionais, o Uma outra forma de rentabilizar o negócio é através da publicidade que a ferramenta disponibiliza para outras marcas e empresas. Aqui entra uma outra parte delicada, a publicidade não se adequa em qualquer plataforma e ferramenta e nem sempre condiz com a demanda do usuário. Além do que, a publicidade também está mudando e buscando outras formas de se vender. Não é de se duvidar que em pouco espaço de tempo isso também perca seu valor na estrutura de formação de receita.Ainda assim, existem plataformas que não utilizam uma rentabilização ou não possuem nenhuma fonte de recursos. Como elas sobrevivem? Do que se alimentam? Como dormem?É aqui que quero chegar, puxar a cadeira e falar, meus amigos, vejam bem…Muitas dessas Startups (empresas, aplicativos, tecnologia, Saas) vendem sonhos. Vendem promessas que muitas vezes não sabem como vão alcançar — ou tentam, através de indicadores criados por elas mesmas, o que não dá muita garantia. Vendem possibilidades e ganham muito dinheiro com isso. Como? Através de inúmeras rodadas de investimentos.O que vem acontecendo é que muitas empresas, muitas mesmos, estão captando dinheiro através de investimentos, vendendo o sonho do empreendedorismo sem entregar absolutamente nada, afinal de contas é tudo um grande teste.E aí? Aí que vivemos num mundo que ok, talvez um dia não precise mais de dinheiro, mas que ainda assim, precisará de resultados. Acontece que os investidores começarão a repensar sua forma de investir (e isso já vem acontecendo nos Estados Unidos e em boa parte do mundo), mais do que ofertar tecnologias que preencham uma necessidade do usuário, as empresas precisarão pensar em como de fato gerarão valor para os acionistas, para os usuários, para os stakeholders e até mesmo, ou fundamentalmente, para o mundo.Mundo este que não é uma colônia de férias, uma hora a conta vem, resta saber quem vai começar a pagar por ela… Ou viraremos todos hippies e poderemos viver de amor, quem sabe?!Lavo, cozinho e ajudo as pessoas a empreenderem =)Traga suas histórias e ideias sobre empreendedorismo, startups e inovação.

Thinking back on the recent history of TV startups, I’ve come to the conclusion that this is likely the best time in history to start a TV or entertainment-related startup. This’ll be a two-parter from me, and I’ll start by a summary of the past 20-odd years of innovation and change in the industry. While many people would say the TV startups that came and went over the past 5 years (Aereo, Miso, GetGlue, ZillionTV, BeeTV, Yap, etc) and the ones still in play (Zeebox, i.tv, Peel, Viggle — disclosure: I work there! etc) were the “TV 2.0″ startups, I’d actually argue they were the 3.0, and it’s now time for 4.0 (though I could easily go for 7.0 without a big stretch). Confused? Lemme ‘splain:But for today’s purposes, I’ll skip through to the mid-90′s, to define “TV 1.0″ — a time where TV watching was all done on a “TV set”, likely with a set-top box, and the majority of TV watching was done “live” (something I’ll be explaining to my kids forever). With the advent of the Slingbox, and to a lesser degree a variety of streaming devices/services, TV then moved not only off schedule, but off-And then came a Unfortunately we need to sour the story for a moment, as most of these ventures went belly-up. In some cases the companies needed deeper pockets and longer runways. In many others we were seeing technology solutions seeking out consumer or industry problems. Some are still up and running, and thriving. Most aren’t.And with failure I think the most important thing to look at is VP Products No IT Dept: You’re On Your Own

In this third episode of the Listen and you’ll learn about how to decide what to pay yourself when you’re the boss, why being CEO is one of loneliest jobs you can imagine, and what it’s like pitching the iPad in front of Steve Jobs.Full disclosure: I’m a proud investor in MoveWith. In this podcast we spend a lot of time talking about what it’s like going from a big, iconic company to a teeny startup, but I wanted to explain what got us so excited about MoveWith in the first place.Holly worked in one of the most high-pressure environments imaginable — Apple under Steve Jobs. She managed teams that developed the new Macbook product line and coordinated global product launches. She got to talk to the press about wildly anticipated projects. While most people would kill for a job like this, Holly wanted to build a new venture from the ground up around her personal passion of fitness.As I got to know Holly I learned that this determined streak was a core theme of her personality. In high school and college she worked towards becoming an olympic skier until an injury sidelined those ambitions. When we first met with Holly, it was clear that MoveWith was more than a company, it was her life’s work. Moreover, when we referenced the business, everyone had the same thing to say “we love the company, and we really love Holly.”There’s been a tremendous amount of innovation in the fitness space in the last couple years. The all-you-can-eat ClassPass model has earned rave reviews from users and massive valuations from VCs, though in our diligence we heard that not all studios were as enthused. SoulCycle brought disco/club-type production values to spinning classes. But Holly saw that most startups were focusing on the space or equipment, not the teachers. In her experience the teachers were the lifeblood of classes and so she set out to uncouple locations in teachers. By focusing on this underserved segment, she’s created a growing team of trainers who act as advocates for her business.As a side effect, this lead to the creation of an amazing line up of innovative classes. Instead of doing yoga in a stuffy gym, MoveWith instructors find interesting spaces like churches and nightclubs to offer their courses. Some use this uncoupling to make classes even more convenient, by holding them in the workout rooms of apartment buildings, for instance. Additionally, the types of classes getting created are totally unique — from multi-day retreats to run + yoga classes.Even though she worked at the highest levels of technology, moving from a massive hardware company to a nimble software-based strategy is risky. Apple could seemingly summons the world’s experts in any field to help on its products. And despite her passion for fitness, Holly had never managed all of the functions of a business. Holly recognized these risks and sought out ways to prove that they wouldn’t be insurmountable obstacles. Holly knew that she’d need advisors to support her on the MoveWith journey.To supplement her business expertise she recruited To prove her product chops, Holly put up a crude landing page simply to see if she could fill classes. She recruited a few top teachers in Boston and before long she was holding dozens of classes that filled up almost instantly. Before she had a mobile app, or even any capital, she made sure she could fill studios with people eager for her unique take on classes. I really admired that scrappy effort to prove out the business concept. In fact, I joined one of these classes and went for a run around the Charles River then a yoga class in a co-working space. Needless to say, I was hooked as both investor and customer! (can’t wait for the NYC launch!)We couldn’t be more pumped to have backed Holly and the MoveWith team (along with Don’t have time for a podcast? You’re in luck! We have also prepared a transcript with links, highlights, and other audiovisual elements for your skimming and sharing pleasure.Hi listeners. I’m Micah Rosenbloom, host of Collective Wisdom, the podcast where we get busy bringing you lessons from strong founders, to help pump up your startup. I’m a venture capitalist with Founder Collective, we’re a seed stage VC firm that is invested in companies like Uber, Buzzfeed and Hotel Tonight. Today we’re going to be talking to Holly Shelton. She’s the founder of MoveWith. A company that turns the world into a workout club. Imagine a yoga class in a club that hosts raves. Or if you favorite teacher taught classes in your apartment building work out room. That’s basically what Holly’s building. It’s a bit like Airbnb for fitness.Now, admittedly we’re biased, I think this is a brilliant idea. We’re now proud investors. This was a big risk for Holly. Before starting MoveWith, she was at Apple. Where she was product manager in charge of the MacBook computer line. You might be listening to this podcast on one of her computers. She worked with some of the most brilliant people in the world and her decision shaped the way millions of us work. Probably many in the tech world would kill to have her job. Holly was also a competitive skier. She loved fitness and thought there was a better way to bring product to market. That entrepreneurial fire burned deep in her, she decided to give up that kush gig at Apple and start MoveWith. We’re thrilled to talk to her today about what it’s like pitching Apple products in front of Steve Jobs, the dramatic changes in the fitness industry that led her to found move with, and what to do if you chip your tooth in route to a pitch meeting.What got me here, I grew up as an athlete, I’ve lived and breathed some sort of fitness since I was 5. Along the way I’ve had incredible trainers, incredible coaches, people who helped me realize something that I didn’t know was possible. For me, when I look, I’ve always wanted to do something to help people, not just be healthy on the outside, but healthy on the inside. That’s actually, for me when I realize that I could do something, it was more on the inside than the outside. It was always a person that got me there. The question that we asked ourselves was, “How can we use technology to foster those sparks. And to actually help people have fun, stick with it, and explore new things that they didn’t know was possible.”We’re empowering teachers to host all kinds of classes in all sorts of interesting unique spaces. Imagine doing yoga on a rooftop at sunset, rave yoga at the Oberon Theater in Harvard Square with 300 other people and having a drink after. Or run yoga where you run really hard for 45 minutes on the Charles River and finish with candlelight yoga in an office space.There’s a hunger of people to be lead by somebody and do something together. It’s mass for, it’s right for disruption because of those trends, and then simultaneously, the thing with owning and gym is you have high fixed costs, you only have high utilization at certain hours of the day. It’s really business that for a lot of people doesn’t make sense. When you start thinking about how can you disrupt this high fixed cost problem, you start thinking about what really fitness happen anywhere, why don’t we just take that out of the equation.If you like what you heard from MoveWith, stay tuned and you’ll hear from Seed-stage venture capital fund built by a collection of successful entrepreneursEssays on Tech, Startups, and Trends from Founder Collective, a seed-stage VC firm that has invested in companies like Uber, MakerBot, Buzzfeed,  Hotel Tonight.

Recently, I was asked to open an evening event for an initiative called After a short self introduction, I asked the audience if anyone could tell me the definition of a startup. One person responded that it was “I find it fascinating that entrepreneurship and startups are very sexy and hip right now, yet we don’t necessarily understand what they are.I then shared four quotes of people/companies which are extremely influential within the entrepreneurial world:Steve Blank wrote Eric Ries is the protégé of Steve and wrote the book on how to create a lean startup.Paul Graham founded YCombinator, a seed level startup accelerator with over 500 startups to its credit. Including AirBnB, Dropbox, Reddit and Disqus.The Kauffman Foundation is the largest foundation which focusses on entrepreneurship.I find it bizarre that all of these entities have such a wildly different definition of what a startup is.Mark Suster, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur turned top tier venture capitalist has a slightly different perspective. It’s all of the other definitions we see here, as well as I’m inclined to agree with Mark. Rather more, I’m in no position to disagree with any of the above statements, which leads me to conclude that a startup is what you make it.Entrepreneurship on the other hand, is much better defined, and tends to fall into two fairly distinct categories, Small/medium sized enterprises and Innovation driven enterprises. The differences aren’t subtle, and despite the Silicon Valley snobbery, both are incredibly important to the world.The motivations and consequences are usually starkly contrastingThe difference of their impact is most obviously seen in terms of revenue growth.To understand what an innovation driven company really is, we can consider that if, just ten years ago, I told you in a And now their products have become so engrained in our lives that they have become verbs.So now we know that these two types of entrepreneurial company are different, and need to be treated very differently - and yet, actually, there are a lot of similarities.The most obvious similarity, is that they both create jobs and provide economic stimulation. Established companies, particularly those more than ten years old, have been firing faster than they are hiring, causing a net negative impact on the global job market. Startups on the other hand, by default, have a net positive impact on the job market.At the same time, like the moth and butterfly, the origins of both types of company (SDE/IDE) are also the same. A person or group of people have some form of revelation, inspiration or idea.This is the begining of a journey that not everyone will take, but for those who are curious and courageous, what comes next?This is a recipe for entrepreneurial success:And yet, just like you cannot expect a child to ride a bicycle after watching videos on YouTube, this recipe itself is useless without support and nurture.It’s our job to educate the entrepreneurs of tomorrow - but not just in a class room. It’s our job to facilitate that these experiences can be real and not simulated. Like many things in life, entrepreneurship is learned much better by doing it for real. It’s also our job to get involved and be active - not just point people in the right direction and push.We also have as much to learn from these people as they do from us.And that’s the very foundation of the NL Innovators proposition.Works with companies  individuals to inspire, educate  support them to step outside of their comfort zone, whilst making new ideas come to life.

U.S. startup deal volumes, round sizes, and total capital allocation increased significantly quarter-over-quarter from Q1 ‘14. While deal volumes did increase, it was not enough to ease upward pricing pressure. As competition from an increasing number of firms for the hottest companies continues to drive prices upward, average round sizes (and therefore valuations) continue to climb.Seed stage volumes appear to have dropped, though many attribute this to a change in how companies at the earliest stages view funding announcements. Despite this potential shift, reported capital flowing to startups at this stage continues to increase.The most dramatic shifts in deal volume and prices continue to take place at the earliest and latest stages of the funnel.

startups and love are 2 sides of the same story. full of joys, stress, ambiguity, doubt and a complete lack of clarity about whether you are doing the right thing at any given moment.both are deeply counter intuitive — trying hard for stability can over turn you, failing to be delusional can be delusional in itself, and planning for the long term can very well lead to the longest term pain.both are incredibly lonely journeys, it is a teamwork, doubtless, but you, and you alone have to make decisions at the junctures. if and when you allow others to make the decision for you, it will end up in tears, not least of all, yours. the hard thing is, you never know when you are actually allowing that.it is also incredibly stressful. your life, the lives of people, no, the people you love are literally on the line. you could cause a lot of happiness, anguish based on every word you say. the hard thing is, you are going to cause both no matter what you do.it is also impossible to know what reality is. how could you, when it is nearly impossible to distinguish fact from illusions? and even if there are facts, do they really matter, since the point is to precisely create your own facts, your own reality?it is also hard to even know what reality you want to create. along with yours, everyone’s hopes, dreams, emotions, logic, perceptions of reality get mixed into a giant cauldron. a giant cauldron that is constantly stirring, boiling and popping. which ones are yours, and which ones are others?but lets take a step back. does what you want matter? or is it about what you should do? when is it about your desires, and when is it about responsibility? is it irresponsible to be ever desiring a better version of what you could be, or is it irresponsible to yourself not to?perhaps wants and shoulds are separated as separate dichotomies just because of our need to make sense of the world. perhaps these are false distinctions. can you really do something you do not want, even when you theoretically should? and we often state the shoulds as the right thing to do, but is it really? wants and shoulds are like 2 metals melted together, then broken up into 2 separate bars, each labeled separately.such are passion driven ventures — while we know that such smelting is misleading, but it is inevitable that it happens.and does history matter? of course it does, you are what you did. and what you did is the clearest reflections of what you are. but what parts of it matter, and which ones does not? great ventures happen when you learn the right bits from history, and just as importantly, ignore the right ones. perhaps knowing that distinction is more important than trying to decide on the exact right actions to take. but we barely do that enough, so focused are we on what is ahead that we accept simplistic interpretations of history then forge ahead, blindly.and should we lose naivety? of course you need to. the world is brutal, factual and cruel to naivety. yet naivety is what makes the world beautiful in the first place. naivety is the basis of courage, the basis of beautiful beginnings. so when should you lose naivety?and is it possible to be irresponsible to be ever curious about what could be? of course it is. curiosity means peeking out of your known world, out of your comfort zone. and there is only so much discomfort one can take. yet killing curiosity is like killing life. it is what makes us, us. what makes us embark on such ridiculously hard journeys in the first place.the natural instinct is to be a train on tracks. trains always have perfect direction and clarity of destination, regardless of whether we are even trying to do the right thing.love and startups though, are like kayaks on the open sea. we would never have perfect actions, regardless of how hard we tries. every wave shifts the boat in distance, direction, mental orientation. the right direction one second ago is the wrong one now.perhaps that is why we need stars. it is perhaps ironic that alone in the open sea, you can only see when you can see nothing else.perhaps the stars will only point to one way, like the north star always do. it does not mean it is the right way, it just means that every other way is wrong.and perhaps there is only one way to read the stars and find the courage to follow them, and that is to be you.Bio: 

In 2016, we’re launching a new technology and culture festival in Dublin. Here are the 10 (personal) principles for that undertaking that I am working from:1. The event should stimulate conversations between Ireland and the worldWriter, editor and internet arguer. 

In 3 short years, Anghami grew to 50 employees and 15 million users. Based in Lebanon, Anghami quickly became the biggest and hottest startup in the Middle East. I joined a few months after Anghami was founded, and experienced a tough journey to reach where we are today. Here’s a few things I went through along the way.A lot of things happened as the team grew. The management process automatically changed as the iOS team evolved from one remote iOS developer to an in-office developer to a team of 4 developers. It was energy consuming to get on board 3 interns and 2 full timers who all joined within a week. I learned not only how to manage a team, but several teams, and to connect teams together. Each person has to be treated differently. And, while decisions keep changing, no one’s work should go to waste. I learned how to balance between what drives the business forward and what is good for each individual (which also helps drive the business forward).I grasped the difference in working with people who are really passionate about the app and those who don’t give a damn. The passionate and talented ones are really interested in making things happen and making sure they’re done well. On the other hand, one ineffective colleague can drain the team, and the morale became better when they left the company.I felt the impact of company outings on individuals’ enthusiasm. The whole team having fun gently reminds us how happy we are to work together.The team grew because of the milestones we reached. I remember well when we celebrated reaching a million users (we’re at 14 million now), opening a second office (we have four now), and having artists like Elissa and Lady Gaga talk about Anghami. We celebrate and give credit to the team for all these small successes that have gone into making Anghami the standard reference for music.It turned out that it’s good to have a rough tough boss always pushing me forward and out of the comfort zone.A lot of effort and deep thinking is needed to release the app on a deadline. It’s really easy to delay the deadline, for months. I learned how to atomize, prioritize, and iterate. An interesting lesson is that coherence among everyone’s work is more important than doing what’s right. The team has to be aligned. I learned that waiting for perfection is imperfect.There’s always differing opinions in the team about anything. Someone wants a feature dropped, another wants more of it. It’s important to consider everyone’s valuable thoughts, but without entering an infinite loop. At the end I have to come up with something that is simple, usable, and makes people happier.People are emotional when it comes to music. They throw rants on Twitter for giving them the wrong song and tweet love when Anghami delivers an hour of good music. I worked on meeting the needs of Anghami’s audience without changing our essence.Most of my family, friends and even random people that I meet know Anghami. Everyone actively tells me what they like in the app and what needs improvement. It is truly rewarding to work on a product that everybody understands and uses.I learned how features should be obvious. Everything should be out there. Hiding a feature inside a tab essentially kills that feature. Buttons should be clear.I learned how to juggle many tools, especially when it comes to analytics and finding information. I quickly honed the skills needed to manage an app as popular as Anghami, like project management, database querying, analyzing mobile and web behaviors, email delivery, monitoring crash logs, using marketing tools, and reviewing push notifications.The way things evolved during the past few years was very overwhelming, and one time I told a friend that I feel under qualified for my job. Turns out it’s a normal feeling when I’m learning plenty and expanding my mind in different ways. Passing through hard times was worth it because I was able to challenge myself, grow, learn and adjust to the ever-evolving work environment.Join the biggest startup in the Middle East!

Last week I had the honour of being part of an Entrepreneurship Mission to Berlin, headed by our awesome President of Slovakia Andrej Kiska. His goal was to take successful Slovak entrepreneurs, scientists, members of academia and our fledgling startup scene to see how things are done abroad in the European entrepreneurial HQ. And of course the goal for us was to take something home with us so that we can help grow our ecosystem here. This is a write up of what I learned in Berlin and think that Slovak startups need most above competition, delegations, conferences and state aid.*Disclaimer: I am an impatient guy that is always looking for ways how to make things better, which often results in me seeming to some as ungrateful or negative, but rest assured I have only the best intentions in mind.Even though the startups at the Going hand in hand with ambition is also the courage to go out and fulfil our ambitions. It is hard and puts people off because it takes so much work, stress and high chances of failure. On the opposite side you’re not only building a great company, doing what you love, ensuring your personal and team success, creating jobs, inspiring others around you to follow suit, but also pave the way for a better future for the whole country as entrepreneurship is key to growth as the US show consistently. We are taught from childhood to use what we are offered and be content with “thats all there is, be glad you have at least that”. What our startup One of the biggest “fails” of our mission in Germany was in my opinion the fact that we as in entrepreneurs and startups were talking to only a very few locals, even though the opportunity couldn’t be better. Most of us flocked together and instead of building networks, finding mentors or investors. We were enjoying free food and talked with the same people we knew from home. Going to Germany to talk to Slovaks is in my opinion a big NONO. Yes it takes courage and is awkward to approach someone we dont know, but its also the best thing we can do esp. if we really want to take something home with us. And there’s nothing better than getting a successful mentor who can not only help with advice, but also serve as inspiration. So guys lets next time focus on building great networks that we can leverage in the future and not waste taxpayers money on fancy trips, free food and drinks.The networking issue is also an issue of presentation and language. Its understood that if our level of communication esp. in English is average or even below that, the presentation of ourselves, our companies, our country will not be better than that and also not help our courage to change it. On the other hand its not about being perfect in English. I know so many people that have an average level, but still are understood by almost everyone because they just speak. Most people I know here think that their English is not good enough to talk to people for fear of embarrassment. This is a vicious circle — if you dont use the language it gets worse, if it gets worse you dont use it and so it continues without improvement. Let me tell you what. Most of us have got far more language classes under our belt than a good 90% of the world from elementary school. And with so many chances to learn english and communication for free like Toastmasters, finding time to speak with foreign friends or even speaking in english at meetings (like we did when preparing for the UK) there’s simply no excuse for not being fluent.Perhaps the biggest thing that can help our startups the most is to focus on foreign markets like the US or the UK from the beginning. This was the advice we received from both the MIT professor, the growth stage startups and What is most important for startup success in Slovakia? To build a better Ecosystem and better companies we cant focus on Slovakia or the CEE. Instead we need to overcome our fear of failure and embarrassment, open our minds to far bigger ambition, start focusing on bigger markets, ideally moving there to build the courage, experience, skills and networks we want and need. If we start with these points then we can bring about the necessary change in the ecosystem, but we have to start with ourselves first.CEO  Co-Founder OrderLord.com

I think the Startup Weekend organizers should get involved. This damages their brand. At least ito your side of the story, this guy has stolen all the code and run off with the whole company, and I don’t think the Startup Weekend folks see their weekend as a ‘Come-and-try-out-for-free-as-an-employee-of-some-jerk Weekend’. At the very least, the Startup Weekend organizers should ensure that he forfeits the prizes…

An old friend of mine dropped into San Francisco recently with her team from a Big Four firm, and while we caught up at the Owl Tree in TenderNob, she said the following:That’s pretty much how the world thinks about startups right now.I didn’t get into startups because they’re A tough economy and bleary professional prospects have made even my most risk-averse friends consider leaving traditional (and stable) jobs to start a startup. The excitement surrounding early stage tech is so high right now that for some people “sitting on the sidelines” has become the risky career move.That’s Anyone who’s started a startup would likely agree that last reason they got into this game was because they were thinking about their “career”.I’m not writing from a pedestal here, having sold a startup company for millions. My first startup is in its third iteration having struggled to find sustainable traction. My incredible co-founder now runs To be clear, my first go as a startup founder left me broke and more than a little bit beaten up.And when I say broke, I mean It was the kind of broke that left me unable to pay rent in Vancouver, having relocated there following our seed funding in 2009. Effectively homeless after foregoing a paycheck for two years, I ended up living on an entrepreneur friend’s couch for more than six months in late 2011.At 30 years old I was living on someone else’s couch without a dime in my pocket, working on our startup at every spare moment.That’s not very cool.Every day for about a year, each morning presented two major challenges:1. Relentlessly search for a successful business model and co-lead our team in pursuit of our vision.If that sounds pretty basic, that’s because it was. When was the last time you worried about eating?Every morning, I woke up on the couch in my friend’s 1,000 square-foot apartment, grabbed semi-clean clothes out of my backpack, took a fast shower and went to the office wondering how I’d afford lunch that day.Oh, did I mention he lived with his girlfriend?I reached a point at which I’d ration out my week on less than twenty dollars. I was forced to ask for help from other entrepreneurs who would buy me meals. I couldn’t always feed myself.Unable to pay bills, I stopped doing so. My pre-startup credit card debt taunted me via collection agency voicemails. My phone went dead.The fallout of going And so you work. All the time.There’s nothing else you can afford to do.The reason I feel it’s important to highlight the hardest parts of my particular founder journey is because not enough of us talk about the ugly bits. Not everyone has this kind of extreme experience, but startups can be brutal.They can be mentally brutal in ways that can only be overcome if you A startup unequivocally means short- and long-term uncertainty. They involve real, tangible risks.A startup can mean pain and embarrassment.A startup can even mean homelessness.I think it’s important to recognize how hard it is to get a startup off the ground, and I Anyone who’s pursuing their dreams deserves credit for the risks they take to achieve them.With that being said, however, I also think it’s important to recognize that startups certainly aren’t for everyone.In fact, they’re not for most people.It’s important to know that the real risks you’re taking on with a startup include the catastrophic kind. There are entrepreneurs who’ve lost relationships to their pursuits. They’ve lost homes and financial security and certainty about where they’ll live and work three months down the road.There are entrepreneurs… good ones… who’ve lost their life to this crazy ride.Let’s never forget this, people.Let’s never let the cool factor bring people towards this kind of life for the wrong reasons. Let’s never let someone find themselves with the world crashing down around them without them having been prepared for that reality.In my mind, startups I just know that there were moments when things got really, really tough when it felt as if the cool factor was all anyone talked about. I’m not here for the wrong reasons, but if I were it would have ruined me.I want anyone contemplating this journey to do it with open eyes.Our community is responsible for the picture we paint, so I hope more of us continue sharing the Marketing  Accounts The Editorial Page

Il y a quelques années, on jugeait une startup comme extrêmement performante quand elle possédait une valeur estimée d’un milliard de dollars. Aujourd’hui, c’est la barre des 10 milliards qu’il faut passer pour rentrer dans un club fermé. En voici les membres.La startup fondée par Drew Houston en 2007 permet à plus de 200 millions d’utilisateurs, à travers le monde, de stocker et partager des données entre leurs différents devices.1.1 milliards de dollars ont été investis dans Dropbox à ce jour, la plaçant à une évaluation de 10 milliards.Fondée en 2008, AirBnB offre la possibilité de louer temporairement son appartement dans plus de 190 pays. A son origine, 3 amis n’arrivant pas à payer leur loyer qui ont décidé de louer leur canapé pour générer des revenus complémentaires.Près de 800 millions de dollars ont été investis dans AirBnB, qui est aujourd’hui évaluée à 10 milliards de dollars.Pinterest est un réseau social permettant à ses utilisateurs de sauvegarder et de partager du contenu multimédia en les « pinnant » à un tableau.Au moment de son décollage, j’ai fait partie de ceux qui doutaient de sa prospérité, mais il a su trouver un marché, notamment auprès d’une population féminine, qui lui permettent d’être aujourd’hui évalué à 11 milliards de dollars.Flipkart est la parfaite illustration de la courante phrase « Une idée ne vaut rien. ». La société s’est lancée avec pour but de devenir le « Megastore online ». 2.5 milliards ont d’ores et déjà été investis dans la startup, qui a conquis le marché indien et est aujourd’hui évaluée à 11 milliards de dollars.SpaceX est un modèle de l’entrepreneuriat par le risque, à l’habitude d’Elon Musk, son fondateur et CEO. SpaceX crée, depuis le design jusqu’à la mise en fonctionnement, des fusées et autres véhicules spatiaux.Sa vision : rendre l’humanité interplanétaire. Dans ses objectifs proches, la création d’une navette spatiale réutilisable. On peut également spéculer que l’investissement de Google dans la société présage le lancement de satellites Google en orbite.Aujourd’hui, SpaceX est évaluée à 12 milliards de dollars, mais est passée par des tournants critiques, tous passés avec succès.Palantir est une société concentrée sur l’analyse des données fondée en 2004. Deux de ses plus gros clients sont la CIA et le FBI.Bien que cette startup soit moins connue du grand public, sa parfaite exécution lui a permis d’être évaluée à 15 milliards de dollars.Snapchat est une application d’échange de messages instantanés et éphémères. Une photo couplée à un texte est envoyée d’une personne à une autre, et disparaît une fois visionnée par le destinataire.Après avoir refusé un rachat par Facebook à hauteur de 3 milliards de dollars, Evan Spiegel, son CEO, avait lancé à Mark Zuckerberg que « Chillah », le fantôme emblématique du service, danserait sur la tombe de Facebook.Fondée en 2012, Snapchat possède aujourd’hui une valeur estimée entre 16 et 19 milliards de dollars.Uber a réussi sur un marché que personne n’avait même pensé à attaquer : celui des taxis. En créant une expérience utilisateur adaptée à notre époque, Uber a créé un modèle en matière de disruption, ainsi qu’énormément de valeur. Près de 6 milliards ont été investis dans la société entre sa fondation en 2009 et aujourd’hui, et elle est évaluée à plus de 41 milliards de dollars.Certains chauffeurs Uber vont jusqu’à gagner 200.000$ par an grâce au service.Xiaomi, encore assez peu reconnue en France, est une société d’électronique chinoise. Ses smartphones sont reconnus comme les meilleurs basés sur Android, et ils possèdent une base d’utilisateurs aussi attachée à la marque que le sont ceux d’Apple.Fondée en 2010, 1.4 milliards ont depuis été investis dans Xiaomi, la hissant à une évaluation de 46 milliards de dollars.Huntr founder.

Joining OneSky has been the greatest (without “one of”) experience in my life so far. There has been so much fun seeing a product grown from nothing to one with a decent number of well-known clients in 5 years. It was an extremely eye-opening journey. Although the journey came to the end last month, it doesn’t mean the bonding between us ended at the same time. The skills I learnt, the knowledges I obtained, the people I met will be with me forever.There was almost no information about how the tech world was like 5 years ago within my circle in Hong Kong. I was about to graduate from the university. Facebook and Google were not even closer than Pluto to me. I was never one of those brilliant kids who figured out how to sell lemonade when they were 6. I didn’t know what to do after graudation.I was a freelancer when studying in university. Some clients who didn’t have technical knowledges and showed no respect to product building pissed me off. I decided not to do that anymore after graduation. OneSky offered a chance to focus on building a sense-making product. I didn’t really care about the topic at that time. It was great enough to build product without dealing with nonsense clients. What’s even better was that it ended up to be what I liked a lot.There’s nobody familiar with translation industry in the team back then. Here came with a lot of problems. It could be very easy to say NO to them. After being pushed to some that I was about to say NO to but got them solved, I realized it’s not that hard. There are usually a lot of solutions for a problems. After all we are not building Tesla or SpaceX. Plus, the learnings obtained during the process would be staying with me forever. The obstacle is the way.I became determined and fearless.There is a Chinese story: a frog sits in a well and looks up to the sky, saying the sky’s so small that it already have known everything about it. Hong Kong was the well before visited the Bay Areas 4 years ago.I met people who were way younger but had achieved way more than me. I realized those people behind the world-class products were also living on the Earth instead of some unknown galaxies. Being a little bit rebel, it made me work harder after that. They had been doing something that I could do as well but didn’t simply because of laziness. I had never had such a strong feeling that I wanted to be part of them.That could be where the ambition and workaholism came from. I don’t want to complain about things and regret of not doing something when I get old.By staying in a very small team, I had the chance to work with everyone directly and be inspired by them. Works have been tough and hard, but the a-ha moments with team members outweighed the intensive working style.It was even greater to work on customer support and sales. Those roles provided me chances to interact with more people from different countries.Experience in customer support taught me how to dig deeper into a problem. Usually a client was not suffering from what he told you. I met a doctor-to-be friend later and he told me this was also what doctors had been encountering as well. Patients usually misunderstand their own problems. Finding out the real problem from a complaint has been a very valuable skill along the way. Plus, some clients had been very nice and helpful that I had learnt a lot from them as well.As an introvert, it was so difficult for me to interact with strangers. I didn’t even talk to people actively in university. The sales experience offered me the most important change in my life. I have learnt how to hustle and interact with people around.Like a sponge, I have been trying my best to absorb the advantages from all the people I met. Sometimes it was difficult to tell if that’s an advantage or disadvantage. I had to imitate it and the other way round to see the difference between the results. It could not work well every time. But given enough number of trials and errors, it could be quite effective.I learnt how to learn. I knew how little that I’d known.The 5-year period was the toughest one I have ever had in my life. There were a lot of shits to solve every day that obviously 8 hours was not enough. I had to work my ass off in order to make sure things were on the right track. The sense of achievements followed had been motivating me when I was about to give up. It was so fulfilling to see a client paid (and had his time saved) because my work.Working with a group of smart, mature and straight forward people was great too. We shared good time playing board games together, made fun of each other. We also delivered values to clients together, helping each other instead of messing up with each other. Without all the great team members I couldn’t have overcome the shit load of work. Some said you couldn’t make friends during work. But I am still very “naive” to believe professionalism and friendship could be maintained at the same time when both are mature and sincere enough. You argue, you understand each other, you improve, you move on.I also made some close and like-minded friends during the people-meeting journey. It was all about the click moments that you could have with each other instead of how long you have met each other or worked with each other. I also received a lot of helps from mentors, friends. Some of their suggestions or comments will be affecting my life forever.I have been very grateful to have met them.The 5-year period is long and short. It is long that I gained hell a lot from it. It is short that I still haven’t reached the goal. It is a pity but I don’t regret at all.I am now having my first vacation in South East Asia after non-stop working for 2 years. I have never been feeling so relaxed.The end of one journey is the beginning of another. I am pretty sure the next one would be more awesome, and keep leading me to the goal.A workaholic who had been working in the tech industry

With the rise of megaconferences in Europe like Web Summit, Slush and The Next Web gathering over 20,000 attendees each, tech event organizers are facing a critical challenge to remain relevant in such a competitive landscape.Some entrepreneurs consider there are too many conferences already. What can event organizers do to better help them grow their business?In the present post, we’ll be looking into the top 5 strategies applied by events to bring value to entrepreneurs and infuse growth to their companies. We’ll be focusing on Europe and most specifically on the founding partner events of These strategies can be useful for any organizer, small or big, in and out of the technology world.The best way to stand out from a crowded market is to be different and tap into a smaller, unstructured segment of the market.Conferences are like the Internet in the way they can tap into a specific niche and address customers who are looking for a community, a place and a message that resonate with their own life or business.An important way for tech events to differentiate themselves is to cover a new topic or an emerging trend. Anybody starting a conference on This is the role of Field Configuring Events as defined by Conferences like A tech event is also poised to be different by its content and its format. It is a fact for anybody who has attended enough conferences Highlighting a local ecosystem is the most efficient way to help startups grow. As a matter of fact, this is the starting point of any important conference and one of the key drivers to success of accelerators and Think of Web Summit igniting the Dublin scene with its Another fascinating achievement is Rude Baguette has recently pointed out that peripheral cities like Helsinki or Dublin consolidated their startup conferences in ways that the main capitals of Europe have not been able to, I’ve just arrived in Istanbul to discover how Startups are attending events mainly for two reasons: clients and investors. While the number of clients and investors attending events is probably growing, the fierce competition between entrepreneurs for their attention is growing as conferences are limited in space and time to a reduced number of days and exhibition halls.We are praising along with many conference organizers for a stronger investment in networking solutions and we are thrilled to witness how some events are dedicating more time and resources to solve this pressing need.The And now Forbes is partnering with Tinder.Is it finally happening?For the past decade, event organizers have been searching for the holy grail of business networking: an efficient and user-centric algorithm that would open the era of automated matchmaking.There are already several apps in this market, such as Will Slack become the go-to companion for entrepreneurs willing to connect with like-minded individuals, Startup conferences have their own networking codes and set of rules that deserve some attention for traditional event organizers. Most industry gatherings and academic conventions function as a platform where long-lasting communities create consensus on their worldview, trade value and more or less directly make business. No need to offer beers at the venue, right?Well, the exact opposite happens in the startup world where everyone has potentially something to pitch.To bring value to the diverse crowd that makes up their audience, tech conferences must embrace an integrated approach to networking. Dinners, parties and cocktails are as important as the conference itself.It also attracts corporate sponsorship, but that’s another story.Organizers can help startups attend their events by different means.First of all, they’re expected to bring sponsors to the show to offset the ticket costs for founders and innovators alike. The most promising entrepreneurs even deserve more than cheap tickets. Monetary and symbolic rewards are an important contribution to this virtuous circle and it’s hard to imagine a startup competition in 2015 without some sort of social incentive.However, you will still find some organizers who are reluctant to give away monetary prizes. Some will even ask finalists to pay for their tickets! Well, this is exactly the opposite of what those formats should provide to contestants.Startup competitions are a rite of passage where community leaders pick the kids who are ready to join adults. A form of contemporary potlatch ruled by unicorns, global brands and legendary pioneers. Circular institutions.If your event is not welcoming a competition or an award ceremony (or both), you should be worried. You’re sending the message to your ecosystem that you’re not part of a community and that you don’t feel that you should be giving back. Press coverage and prestige have never been enough. There is a growing list of tech conferences that have been focusing on their active role as circulation catalysts, organisations that lubricate the system and the flow of value within it. Some are even going nuts such as Some events are even going further, expanding their annual startup competition into an investment program. TechCrunch, The Next Web or Web Summit are dominating the event space with a sophisticated content marketing strategy that hook readers and potential attendees everyday, everywhere.Every conference is a medium for communication and social interaction. But not all event organizers are born equal and only a few are seriously building the right media properties around the event itself.It’s easier if you’re an online media getting into the event business. But it takes a vision to turn this audience into attendees. You will need to align everyone within your organization to make that giant leap forward.On the other hand, traditional media getting into this industry will face immense challenges if they want to build a lasting brand and remain relevant for an audience that is usually new to them.So what should event organizers do to turn their participants into a captive audience?With some inspiration from These are only 5 ways to make it happen and tech conferences have been testing and mastering them for the past decade. So it’s up to you to learn from successful event founders how to remain relevant all year long, everyday and everywhere.This is the ultimate way to provide consistant and measurable value to those entrepreneurs who spent time and money at your gig. You can also learn from them, if you ask the right question in your post-show survey.I believe events can provide immense value to entrepreneurs, especially when they are built with their needs in mind. It might sound obvious but this is ultimately what make some conferences outpace their competitors. What if we could build an alliance of event founders driven by excellence and commitment to the entrepreneurial ecosystem? What if events could strengthen the digital market in Europe?With this ambition and set of values, we’ve launched Our goal is to provide the most promising entrepreneurs with unparalleled advantages at some of the best tech events and help them become the next European unicorns.Wanna join us for the ride?Photo Credits: Founder at Startup Sesame | Instructor at Berklee College of Music, Valencia Campus | Cofounder at Disrupción Records

Once upon a time, companies grew at a steady pace and made plans according to their growth. These days, especially in tech, overnight successes are the norm and a lot of corporate characteristics get lost along the way. Most of the times for the best but also sometimes for the worst…Having been there at different stages both in a quality of employee or advisor and consultant, I made multiple observations in the IT side of the house.You most certainly don’t need IT at all. You hand the credit card to new hires and direct them to the Apple Store or Amazon. “Get what you need and bring a receipt”. This wouldn’t be an issue if you didn’t have a hundred employees Fast forward to that morning when your hundredth employee starts, you grab a MacBook Air from the pile and give it to them. At this point you have deployed at least a hundred computers (not even accounting for losses and terminations) and you have…No records of asset assignment, by the way, do you have a finance guy yet?Police report, what’s the serial number of the computer? Is there intellectual property on it? What’s the p@ssw0rd?Once you think about it, IT might look like either a nice to have or something legacy and complicated. Guess what, there are startups remediating that very problem too. You may not even need an IT department if you have some DevOps or Software Engineering resources to spare.Or the perfect cheat sheet for any startup looking to get serious about IT.If you’re in a modern building, you may have multiple carriers available. It’s good practice to have at least two internet connections on different and diverse providers. Pay close attention as they sometimes resell each other in smaller markets. A cable connection is acceptable as a backup as long as you do not buy it from the same ISP that’s giving you your primary circuit. Find local connectivity brokers, that’s their bread and butter and they will know what you need while you’re still on hold with Comcast.Another good option for internet access is to build a local hub at a colocation facility. Internet circuits are much cheaper at data centers so you get multiple, you can host your core infrastructure at a better facility than any office server room. If your office moves or opens another overflow location, you just need a new point-to-point link (dark fiber or However you chose to access the internet, a real firewall is necessary. Sorry, the Apple Airport Extreme does not qualify. I know it’s pretty but please, no. If you have nobody on staff with network knowledge, consider either outsourcing this to a consultant or go cloud with Wireless access must be individually authenticated using 802.1x (WPA2 Enterprise) and personal credentials. Shared passwords (WPA/WPA2 Personal) are great for home, not the office. A guest network is a good thing to have but must be properly segregated from the office network. Here again, Meraki wins for the ease of use, but beware of scalability issues and lack of advanced features… Investing early on in enterprise-grade wireless systems (Aruba or Cisco) pays off in the longer term. Authentication can be done locally if you have servers. The point here is not to be intrusive but instead to create a healthy set of policies to prevent the worst. I’m assuming a 100% OS X environment by the way. Adding Windows to the mix is doable but costly both in terms of monetary investments and head counts. Prefer virtual machines if Windows is a necessity.If you’re into lean stuff, you can do away with those three things:I’m purposefully not talking about client backups, since it’s resource and bandwidth intensive and most people tend to do the right thing. Thanks Cloud! If you really want to backup computers, Inevitably, you run all your stuff in the Cloud: Google Apps, Dropbox, Expensify, Zendesk, Asana, Greenhouse, Slack... Each provider has its own authentication and provisioning system. Wouldn’t it be nice to have the same password for everything without actually sharing it between apps? Single Sign-On solves that very issue.SSO providers like Some cloud services also allow automated provisioning and de-provisioning, because more automation never hurts.Access to sensitive systems and data (HR, financials, metrics, admin consoles, secret sauce etc), multi-factor authentication should be used. In that domain, Here are some best practices that are reasonably easy to follow:No shared accounts for prod access.In a perfect world, I would have a few honeypots with tripwires all over the place if someone gets in… But that’s just me :)Those are by no means golden rules but they should get any concerned startup on the right track to become more secure and scalable from a head count perspective. A messy production environment is a bad thing, and so is a messy corporate one… Investing in IT early on will save a lot of time later on when you realize every single one of your hundreds of computers needs to be manually touched to be put into compliance.Parisian, San-Franciscan adopted systems guy.

I pieced this together through trial and error from getting my own company going. This post is geared toward early-stage startups in the Bay Area, particularly San Francisco, but much is broadly applicable. Luckily, today they’re enough “recursive” startups (startups for startups) where you can automate most of this stuff.The two most important functions are your lawyer and your accountant. You’ll need ample help from both, so you want someone you trust who gives actionable advice and will not waste your time.As for accountants, I’ve been happy with Most startups will end up as a Delaware C-Corp; your attorneys will guide you.

For a small startup, it’s best to keep your ear to the ground — ask your investors, your bank, your lawyers, and the rest of your network — and find startups that are relocating, which we found to be a great way to get discounted furniture. I tried calling a few office furniture brokers, but unless you’re large, you’re not worth their time.We also relied heavily on We started off having our cap table in Excel, which was a pain as we had different versions flying around in email, and often had to resort to email searches to find what we needed.

Since 2010, I’ve been religiously blogging about the Over the past two years, One of the key things I had to focus through this period of stellar growth was my own ability to scale as a CEO (a solo founder at that). I’ve had to reinvent my role several times — almost like installing a brand new operating system because the company’s needs were just so different.As I pick up blogging again, I wanted to start by talking about the single most important thing I’ve learned as a Founder and CEO here at Everyone knows how important it is to articulate a vision and a path to get there for a CEO. Founder CEOs that are all about product, the customer experience, and about growing a big business by achieving a crazy vision often times don’t appreciate how important the day to day cadence and operations of the business is.For me, I realized the power of it when we had doubled in size in headcount but still didn’t feel like we were doing “double the work.” right in the middle of 2014. This is when I developed my ideas around embracing Operational Ruthlessness means thinking deeply about the drumbeat of the business, thinking deeply about the recurring meetings that drives the management and cadence of the business, and ensuring that you’re setting an aggressive pace and direction for the business so that everyone knows what it means to hit the next important milestone.I think that Founder CEOs tend to think about the basics of operational ruthlessness as they start to build out their team — I certainly did. The basics include:All of those are great. And if you’re not doing them yet or feel that they’re overkill, you’ll definitely see and feel the need for them as you surpass ~25 employees. But in order to achieve true operational ruthlessness, you need kick it to the next level.Some of the more advanced things that I’ve either already implemented or have started to include:I think an entire book can be written on the points above, and for me in my journey, I’m still in the thick of it and living it. What’re you doing as a CEO to achieve the above? Be sure to share your thoughts in the comments section below.I make simple software that helps people communicate better. Im the Founder of Tout: 

Startup Country Report: KENYAThis is a first in a Series of posts I am doing in the next 3 months where I report from the trips I am making to 7–8 African countries as part of looking at new deals and assisting our portfolio. First in the series we examine Kenya.Savannah Fund started off in Nairobi, forming a partnership with Erik Hersman and the ihub/mlab in 2012. We have since invested in 8 startups in Kenya and the our accelerator out of the mlab with 14 companies to date.Kenya is most famous for the pioneering mobile money innovation with M pesa as well as being a “hotbed” of Social Enterprise movement. It was recently named a hub for Nairobi has also been a traditional business regional hub for East Africa and continues to act as an important talent magnet for startups. There has been a steady rise of hubs, workspaces and accelerators — from Nailab, 88mph Startup Garage, Growth hub and of course, the iHub with over 10,000 members setting the bar and inspiration for many other hubs across the continent. The government’s planned Nairobi definitely feels like you are at the center of a Africa’s innovation with a number of high profile startups/social enterprise from Ushahidi, BRCK, Kopokopo, M-KOPA to Bridge International Academies. Our portfolio company Areas to watch around innovation are Financial Services / “fintech” around the unbanked or rising middle class, Internet of things/ machine payments tied to mobile money, solar, education and Internet access.The recent Startups in Kenya often find it difficult to scale beyond their own borders even within East Africa and this hinders ability to raise follow on funding beyond Seed or Series A. Notable exceptions include Cellulant and One Africa Media- so it is possible but not automatic as many business plans point to.Those that don’t scale beyond Kenya find themselves competing for a relatively small market often in the same space as big incumbents- especially when you consider that global startups targeting Africa often chose Kenya as their first market- so competition is stiff especially in the financial services market. For example, in addition to mobile money- Visa, Mastercard, Paypal and even Bitcoin players are competing for customers who are probably seeing all of these products and services for the first time.Safaricom has a reputation of entering many startup turfs and sectors. Their new VC , Spark Fund and opening up of M-PESA API, may be the beginning of a perception change especially as they continue to feel the heat from rival Startups that use Nairobi well as a hub for Subsaharan Africa are well positioned to grow into true Subsaharan “Founder/Managing Partner

“When I was a friendless young entrepreneur, I had no idea how awesome it was to work with incredible people,” says “Product and everything else changes, but the people guide me,” says Rosengarten. “When I met with the lead engineer at OpenGov, my interview was supposed to be an hour or two, and we spent four hours together. I’d found someone who liked technology for tech’s sake. He brought me back to my childhood of programming, and that’s so rare in Silicon Valley, where most engineers have been turned into business people.”Rosengarten reflects that his connection with the other employees at OpenGov was largely about the group’s inventiveness, creativity, and vision. “At OpenGov,” he says, “we were talking about, how do we envision tech’s gonna change over the next 10 years? I realized that he and I could have fun for three years building and solving hard problems. We went from being two adult professionals to being two children together. The lead engineer was a really big component of my decision to join the company. And then the founding CEO had this crazy, incredible vision for a new government.When asked for the specific advice he’d given people who want to find soulmates in the tech industry, Rosengarten says: “Focus on culture- and value-fit. Build relationships and don’t be transactional. If you aren’t sure how to build relationships, then remember that you don’t need a reason to reach out to someone and ask to start a conversation. Even if they reject you, then you’ve learned that maybe they’re not the best person to converse with. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t respect people’s (potentially valuable) time, but I am suggesting that quality conversation and relationship-building yields more reward (however you want to define that) over anything transactional.”After thoroughly exploring Twitter, Mathieu met a lot of people and even joined Quibb. But it was hard for him to make the final decision to switch to a startup. “I talked to a few local startups while in Montreal, but there was no incentive for me to make a move at the time,” he says. “I had great benefits at the bank, a good salary, and there was nothing to push me. But then I moved to Toronto and I had the opportunity to start over completely. That’s when I joined Uberflip. Sandi at Quibb actually introduced me to my current boss. So it all started by following the conversation on blogs and Twitter, then meeting people for coffee, and finally I got my first startup job.”“If you network with the right people, you can definitely succeed in startups without any formal education,” notes Mathieu. “It’s very different than in large corporations. Networking at a big company is more about politics and influence, but in startups it’s more about being helpful and available to your network.”Share what youre reading for work.

For the past few years i have started working for startups. Moving from large organization to start up bought its own set of challenges in how product and engineering is done. There is constant need to evolve and things change in rapid pace. While this creates its own challenges in product management, in this post, i want to share some of the learning in software architecture side, that i think if done right from start will help starts up be more agile with less heartburn.With mobile devices, web and other forms of presentation layers, it is given that presentation layers will change (no matter what you planend at the start). Separating presentation layer (say mobile app or website) from business layer (aka API layer) will make iterations faster. Having micro services is not mandatory for this. There can still be monolithic back-end exposing set of interfaces and set of presentation application consuming these. This is bare minimum separation. Some frameworks make this easy, some don’t. Being conscious of this help.Fact of life in start up — Things will change and you don’t know what to expect. When it changes, expectation will be faster turn around. There is an inherent need to experiment.In order to ship MVP as quickly as possible, the initial compromise that happens on architecture is having single monolithic application that delivers MVP (something where frameworks like ROR is good at). Once live and with some user feedback things start moving in differnt directions. This single monolith will start growing (or gets hacked up) in different directions at same time making it difficult to make changes without impacting multiple things. Overall iteration speed comes down.This can be avoided if architecture allows separation of concerns right from start, where changes in one part of system does not affect unrelated components adversely. Its better right from start to think of SOA or micro services. This comes with cost. It takes little more time to get this right and also it takes effort to deploy, monitor etc., But its worth the effort.Think of dev-ops right from start. I think now thanks to lot of organizations focusing on operations most folks have decent understanding of dev-ops. But still, when starting something, this generally feels like over head. If you do logging and monitoring from day 1 the insight, discipline and efficiency in maintaining systems is tremendous.One critical aspect when having non-monolithic systems is automated deployment. As number of services increases manual deployment becomes error prone and limiting. Now a days most framework has some package or tool that supports automated deployment. Start planning for this right from start. Slight overhead that you may face at start is well worth its time in long run.This is important choice in application architecture. NoSql is pretty common nowadays but unfortunately NoSQL is not solution for all problems, the same way RDBMS aren’t. So think about this choice carefully as you may to live with this for while.Understanding business metrics is key to startup. In general most have things like google analytics, flurry / localytics etc., for understanding user behavior. But thats only part of the insights. there might be other business insights that will be residing in your backend data store. Having analytics system (something better than excel i would say) right from start will go long way in effectively understanding the business. If you use RDBMS then choice of having analytics system on top becomes easier. of course now there are many tools that work on NoSQL also.There is Saas, Paas. Before you start implementing some part of your system that you suspect has generic applicability look around to see if there is a service that you can leverage. Sometimes this need might be an important aspect of your business and you may be tempted to develop in-house. Avoid that temptation and do critical evaluation. It helps in various aspects like continuous improvement of platform without you spending your resources, QA time etc., Once you have traction and bandwidth you can always move things in-house.I don’t see any reason for any one to start with non-http end points. Be this a website, end points of mobile app. However trivial your application is, if your start with https from start, it will save you heart burn down the lane. Also you get some SEO benefits, along with customer trust. Performance degradation you may see with https is pretty negligible now a days, certificates are cheaper. So just start with it.There are 2 ways to scale. Scale out generally works for large orgs and is widely publicized. At the same time, scale up is also equivalently good way. Advantage with scale up is few machines to monitor, debugging using logs is simpler, deployment is easier. Of course there will come a time where scale out will be mandatory but till such time consider scaling up.Head of Products and Engineering,

I remember asking these questions a year ago as my friend raved over the last one she had attended a couple months earlier. I had recently left my job as a financial analyst at a hedge fund and was taking my first leap into the world of startups. I was clueless, terrified, yet excited by the challenge of navigating a completely foreign ecosystem so different from the structured corporate one I was familiar with. With really only the surface understanding that Startup Weekend would require me to “build a company from scratch, pitch to a panel of judges,” and the enticement of enough food to make back the price of my ticket, I accepted the challenge and bought my ticket for Startup Weekend Food Edition.In preparation, I canceled all my plans for that upcoming weekend. Any invitations to dinner or drinks were put on hold. “Why?” They would ask, “Because I’m going to spend the weekend meeting random entrepreneurs trying to hack together a new food startup.” I received bemused smiles, puzzled laughs, and a couple of nudges of encouragement from my cohort of corporate friends. It was going to be an interesting weekend.That Friday evening, I entered into a room buzzing with an energy I could only compare to that of the pre-meet jitters I used to have as a competitive gymnast. Flitting around the room, I was surprised to discover that many of the attendees were similar to me, at a transition point in their careers, ready to take the leap and try something completely new.A few nights prior, I had been facetiously kicking around an idea for a late night food delivery business. After trying and failing to find any half-decent food after midnight, I eventually resorted to some awful combination of $2 pizza and a rampage of Duane Reade’s cookie aisle. So when the Startup Weekend attendees were called upon to give a 60-second pitch of a potential food business, I figured I had nothing to lose, and stood up to pitch my idea,Apparently, a lot of people had and after all the pitches had finished, I was able to to quickly assemble a team that was ready to tackle late night food delivery. It was an exciting moment and as the teams were formed, ours got to work immediately mapping out our individual strengths and our product roadmap for the next couple of days.Over the course of that one weekend, I learned how to create basic wireframes, the importance of conducting user interviews, the difference between flat and skeuomorphic design, the necessity of distilling down a very clear problem, what the term MVP actually stood for, how to determine TAM, the essential elements of crafting a pitch deck, and perhaps most importantly how to balance conflicting ideas, test assumptions, and iterate (very) quickly.After two sleepless nights, pitch day arrived, and our team had already learned more about the on demand food delivery space than most of us had ever cared to know. What had started as a half-serious idea and a 60-second pitch had now transformed into a project five people had poured dozens of hours of hard work into. We had cobbled together a very basic prototype, created a logo and tagline, interviewed over 100 potential users, calculated initial financial projections, and crafted a well-designed pitch deck to boot. Moreover, despite having a lifelong discomfort with public speaking, I was given pitch practice and critique sessions that allowed me to become increasingly confident even over the course of just a few hours.Pitch night was one of the more inspiring professional presentations I had been to in quite some time. It was not so much the ideas, but rather the effort and cohesive passion I witnessed among each of the team members who had, for all intents and purposes, been complete strangers just 48 hours prior.When it came time to announce the winner of the Weekend and my team was called, our entire team jumped up in surprise and triumph. Yes, we had put in an unbelievable amount of effort, but what surprised us was that we had managed to come together as a team that was derived from a host of different backgrounds completely unrelated to startups or tech. While winning a competition like Startup Weekend was indeed thrilling, it ultimately served a more important purpose; it was the impetus that gave every single member of that initial team the confidence to dive headfirst into the intoxicating world of entrepreneurship: of creation, ownership, and innovation that we all had only dreamed of before that fateful weekend.A year later, I am the Co-Founder of Looking back, Startup Weekend was but one external factor that nudged me in the direction I am pursuing today. More important than the external push though, was the open and bold mindset with which I approached that Weekend and all weekends thereafter. As I tell many aspiring entrepreneurs, it’s no longer about knowing where you’ll be leaping, nor whether you’ll make it to the other side. In fact, don’t be surprised if you don’t make it your first time… Leap anyways.Startup musings Food for thought from the hospitality community and friends. Curated by the content team at Reserve.

I love startups, and I think its partly because I’ve had amazing experiences working/interning at startups that shaped my view of entrepreneurship. While working under some startup founders, I noticed inspiring habits of theirs that makes work really fun and satisfying for me and other startup employees working under them. In fact, I’m constantly trying to apply these habits to my own startup projects. So here are 7 of the most inspiring habits of startup founders I’ve noticed:Working at a startup is so much more than just a pay check or a few more bullet points on your resume. The way startup employers treat their employees makes a huge difference, just like all these startup employers did for me. If you’re considering working at a startup, take the startup founders into consideration more than the specific role or industry. In my experience, that has mattered more than anything else. If you’re a startup founder yourself, take the time to consider work culture. No one likes to work for someone whose solely focussed on product, growth and revenue. But if you’ve bothered to read this article to the very end, you probably know that already :)Startup lover, creator of Social MOOC Taker (Connecting diverse talent with awesome companies at helloawesome.co

First came the UK, then the US and now Australia: the trend of putting crack digital units — an A-Team of coders, content developers and thinkers — in charge of government services has been a strangely overlooked phenomenon in recent years.The emergence of small, digital services teams is a push to bring a leaner, more flexible, startup culture into government while quietly acknowledging that traditional organisational structures just don’t cut the mustard in the information age.“Governments are looking at entirely new ways of getting things done. Concepts around lean, agile development are being explored, as well as the focus on customer experience, motivational design, visualisation and new ways to interact/engage with people,” says Bob Hayward, Managing Director of KPMG’s Singapore-based Asia Pacific Centre of Excellence (CoE) for IT Leaders.In Australia, the Government recently launched a Digital Transformation Office (DTO) inside the Department of Communications, which it plans to operate “more like a startup than a traditional government agency” with a “relentless” and “agile” approach to digital services. Not words you’d commonly associate with government.The DTO brings together a combination of diverse talents — web developers, designers, researchers and content specialists — from across the Australian government and the private sector to quickly improve the government’s digital services and make them more relevant and user-friendly.“The biggest obstacles to innovation are cultural,” the Australian Minister for Communications, Malcolm Turnbull, Australia was able to look at a couple of similar models of digital transformation undertaken in the UK and US. A year ago the US government rolled out 18F, a startup-like team housed at the General Services Administration, which delivers user-centric digital and web services.In 2011, the UK Government launched its Government Digital Services (GDS) team within the Cabinet Office to provide ‘user focused, cost effective and maintainable digital services’ based on design principles.Two years ago the GDS embarked on a transformation programme to create new digital services where none previously existed and better ones where they did. It set itself a target of 400 working days to transform 25 major public services, building ‘digital ‘exemplars’ so good that people would prefer to use them’.“The key thing was picking big transactions that are currently being used by a lot of citizens,” says Mike Beaven, Transformation Programme Director for GDS, It required a broad engagement and collaboration: a team of between 80–90 people from the GDS working directly with multiple government departments — frontline civil service people, policy analysts — who all contributed to the process. “People on the ground understand the users and know how the service needs to work, and, more importantly, where users have been historically frustrated with it,” Mr Beaven says.The GDS created 20 new digital services for the public through its 400-day digital transformation programme and its approach is now a working model for other governments — not just Australia — but Singapore, Korea, Japan and Malaysia.“There is a dawning realisation that you cannot rely on existing IT professionals from within government for many of these needs,” says Mr Hayward. “Asking current government IT professional developers to work on engaging, content-rich, mobile apps that are intuitive, fun and perhaps have elements of gamification involved would be a very big task today.”The skills required for digital transformation are varied and specialist and the GDS was given its own hiring powers to shape the team. Recruits come from outside the government sphere, with extensive digital experience. Mr Beaven, for example, worked on digital platforms of “That is why governments are turning to a new breed of innovative developer firms that have a blend of creative types, most likely from an a digital ad agency background and with outstanding user experience design skills — but which also still understand the demands of larger enterprise requirements around security and integrity,” Mr Hayward adds.I used to write for newspapers  mags for 15 years but I have recently changed tack.

It’s cool, not everyone can fit into a start-up environment.With so many start-ups mushrooming every other day and job portals filled with listings of vacancies available at these startups, you might be tempted to apply. The casual dress code, the bean bags and the funky offices may seem like just the thing you’ve been looking for.However, do be aware that not everyone can fit into a start-up environment. Despite how things look from the outside, working in a start-up can be overwhelming and you might be getting more than what you bargained for. Before taking the leap, ask yourself if you’re the kind of person who can thrive in a start-up environment.If you fall in the category of the five kinds of people mentioned below, it’s best that your veer away.Every startup is founded to address a problem or a gap in the market. Founders of start-ups put their hearts and commit their life’s work to it. They need a team who is equally as passionate and motivated to get things off the ground and look for creative solutions to problems. Passion and curiosity are traits they look for even if you know nothing about the industry of your start-up, as these traits can help you learn and grow. If you’re not curious about learning new things and seeking innovative solutions to daily problems that arise, you’ll find work at a start-up more demanding and invasive than rewarding.A start-up work environment can be very volatile. There are going to be changes in company policies, business strategy and the very product or service you’re working to create. You need to be willing to figure things out on the go and be open to experimentation as your company grows. If you’re scared of doing something wrong, if you stress out, throw you hands up in the air and look for someone else to help when a problem arises, you’re better needed somewhere else.The priorities of a start-up may shift daily and require you to take on different roles, not traditionally associated with your job. If you’re a marketing manager, you may also be writing content, running social media and helping out with business development at times. You may also be working bizarre hours and be working from home. If you’re not willing to wear a lot of hats and you’re not excited by getting things done outside of a traditional and predictable structure, you’re better off elsewhere.Working in a start-up during the early stages can be quite exciting. There’s no better feeling than being a part of a company that’s growing and knowing that you’re playing an active part in its success. When a small group of people work together, daily operations, failures and mishaps are bound to happen. This coupled with the uncertainty of start-ups makes it easy to think negatively about how management is disorganized or how things are doomed for failure. If you get bogged down by these circumstances, you should probably rethink your decision to work at a start-up.Start-ups are hard work and will require you to put in long hours. You will be working with a small team where everyone is playing multiple roles and is accountable for all those roles. There is no passing the buck in a start-up and things always don’t end with just the completion of your work. Being part of a start-up means seeking out information related to your role that will help the business succeed. This could mean attending different seminars or cocktail nights to meet people to collaborate with or even show support for other local businesses. If you’re looking to start at 9 and leave by 6, a start-up gig might come as a rude shock.Limitless is here to spread knowledge into the information age, because information may provide data, but knowledge can free your mind.Curated Writings where Information becomes Knowledge.

Méritos cinematográficos e literários à parte, a trama traz de plano de fundo algo ainda pouco explorado pelos entusiastas da série da AMC: o desenvolvimento de Breaking Bad possui tantos elementos sobre empreendedorismo que a Isso decorre do fato de a história se desenrolar em pouco mais de um ano, no qual um pai de família pacato, que enfrentava dois turnos de trabalho para ser remunerado em $40mil dólares por ano (salário de um classe média-baixa americano) descobre possuir um câncer de pulmão ao passo que sua mulher está novamente grávida, funda um império que “poderia ser listado na Nasdaq”.Apesar de inesperada, a vida de empreendedor já havia sido iniciada por Walter na pós-graduação, quando ajudou a fundar a Grey Matter, empresa que tornou um sucesso estrondoso após a venda de sua participação por $5mil dólares, valendo, no começo da série, $2,16 bilhões de dólares. Essa ferida nunca cicatrizou e ele levou grandes aprendizados para sua nova empreitada: produzir metanfetamina de alta qualidade.Por estar oferecendo um produto em um mercado de extrema incerteza e cujo potencial de crescimento era enorme, podemos dizer que White, juntamente com seu aluno do colegial, Jesse Pinkman, fundaram uma startup.Obviamente, faturarPor isso, nós, do A essência de qualquer empreendimento bem sucedido é fato da empresa explorar uma necessidade de um mercado pouco competitivo, ou seja, basicamente liderar a exploração de um novo. Esse mercado é chamado de No caso de Breaking Bad, Walt reconstrói a lógica do mercado tradicional de metanfetamina (que era super concorrido) ao ter sido capaz de produzir a droga com 99,1% de pureza logo em sua primeira tentativa, tornando-se a forma mais pura e mais valiosa disponível. Até então, a oferta era regulada pela premissa de Jesse:Em suma, quem imaginava que havia uma demanda de tamanha qualidade para uma droga tão pesada, consumida pelos viciados menos exigentes e ainda disposta a pagar $60 dólares o grama?Com seu processo perfeito de produção, ele adicionou um novo padrão à curva de valor, o que permitiu galgar um mercado inexplorado e escalonar seu negócio.No caso do tráfico de metanfetamina, ainda que fosse uma produção extremamente complexa, eram raros os químicos envolvidos no processo. Em um mercado bilionário (haja vista ao lucro da Heisenberg), a falta de especialização era um impeditivo para um produto de alta qualidade.Desde o começo da trama, fica claro que Walter não é só um grande químico, mas um apaixonado pela ciência. Por isso, apesar de parecer ter caído meio que de paraquedas no tráfico, nosso herói fez o que era mais racional: buscar uma forma de ganhar dinheiro (o suficiente para tratar do câncer) utilizando sua habilidade e conhecimentos raros.Exatamente igual, Jesse era um excelente vendedor, apesar da sua ignorância com a química. Assim, consegue extrair valor da sua capacidade de vendas em um mercado que ele é apaixonado (ou viciado): das drogas.Em ambos os casos, a percepção é a mesma: quando você está apaixonado por algo, você tende a gostar de trabalhar nesse campo, permitindo-lhe estar mais disposto a arriscar e dedicar horas e horas.Tirar uma startup do papel é um trabalho hercúleo; demanda-se uma quantidade imensa de trabalho e dedicação. Esse é um erro comum dos empreendedores de primeira viagem: achar que o valor da sua ideia já basta. Ninguém jamais alcançou o sucesso sem uma grande equipe, nem mesmo os grandes gênios.Walt estava ciente desde o início que não seria capaz de tocar o negócio sozinho. Por isso, trouxe Jesse para fazer algo fundamental e que não detinha conhecimento: distribuir o produto.Pinkman conhece o setor, já que ele tem experiência anterior em venda e distribuição (e, principalmente, uso) de narcóticos. É, por conseguinte, o co-fundador não técnico. E como a maioria dos co-fundadores não-técnicos de startups, ele ainda tem que aprender a tecnologia para ajudar seu co-fundador. White, por outro lado, tem uma visão técnica do mercado, conseguindo produzir com qualidade superior, porém sendo sofrível na condução inicial dos negócios. Tal qual seu sócio, ele precisa aprender bem as funções do outro para resguardar os corriqueiros deslizes do garoto. Logo, fica claro que co-fundadores precisam ser flexíveis, já que os empregados vêm e vão, como Todd e Badger.O dueto Walter-Jesse foi bem sucedido não por seu produto ser inovador e de alta qualidade. A Heisenberg cresceu porque eles trabalharam bem juntos. Há quem diga, inclusive, que Jesse não passaria da segunda temporada da série, mas que o entrosamento entre os dois, tanto na trama quanto na atuação, foi tão brilhante que decidiram mantê-lo.Uma ideia sem capacidade de execução é apenas uns rabiscos sobre um papel. Sabendo disso, os investidores vão olhar para sua equipe bem a fundo antes de assinarem o cheque. Obviamente, não foi diferente com a Heisenberg.Gustavo Fring, o grande empresário da metanfetamina do sudoeste americano, quando oferta para Walter que produza em um laboratório high-tech construído ao custo de milhões de dólares, deixa bem claro que não quer Jesse por perto, uma vez que ele, por ser um viciado, não é qualificado para o trabalho. A negociação só acontece por conta da força de equipe de White e sua determinação em suprir as deficiências de Pinkman.Existe um medo comum dos empreendedores em lançar algo com falhas e uma crença de que é possível, logo de cara, alcançar um produto perfeito. Quantas startups não existem por aí que tinham um potencial gigantesco mas falharam, principalmente, em demorar demais para se lançar ao mercado? Esse erro tão comum não acontece com Walter e Pinkman.Logo no primeiro episódio, ambos se enfiam em um trailer velho e partem para o deserto para cozinhar. Sem luxo, sem equipamentos perfeitos, sem todos os ingredientes e sem calças, se lançam na tentativa de produzir um MVP (minimal viable product).Se você quer inovar ou produzir grande trabalho criativo, pense como a Heisenberg:a) Você nunca vai ser capaz de liberar qualquer coisa que seja 100% perfeita. Seu produto só precisa ser bom o suficiente para realmente atender as necessidades dos clientes.Sua rede é uma ótima maneira de construir uma clientela inicial ou estabelecer parcerias fundamentais para tornar seu negócio viável. Na história, fica claro que Walter nunca teria sido capaz de distribuir seu produto para as pessoas certas, se não fosse por Jesse, afinal, ele não podia sair por aí vendendo duas libras de metanfetamina para qualquer um. A trama, então, começa a ganhar asas pelas conexões criadas por meio do networking.Primeiramente, conseguem estabelecer sua primeira parceria (apesar de fracassada), logo na primeira temporada, com um pequeno, porém perigoso grupo de traficantes, liderado pelo psicopata mexicano Tuco. Assim, percebem que para ter uma estratégia bem sucedida de go-to-market (GTM), eles precisarão estabelecer boas relações com players com capacidade de escoar imediatamente a droga produzida.Posteriormente, contratam Saul Goodman, um advogado porta-de-cadeia, para os auxiliar nos serviços jurídicos. Walt, ainda, coloca Skyler como CFO da startup, já que ela é especialista em contabilidade e altamente confiável, dando início a uma estruturação de funções.Por Saul ter excelentes conexões no ramo, ele acaba se tornando um aliado fundamental, inclusive, apresentando-os para Gus Fring, que se torna o grande investidor da Heisenberg. Gus é um mestre do empreendedorismo, tendo estabelecido parcerias inclusive com seus rivais. Suas conexões estão no Departamento de Narcóticos, no México, nas ruas e em multinacionais, tudo para escoar enormes quantidades de cristais de forma imperceptível.Apostar na criatividade ou genialidade é fundamental para os que querem empreender. Já para os que querem se tornar gigantes, apostar em processos e coesão é o fator determinante. Essa mentalidade procedimental é construída pela cultura, pela identidade interna de uma empresa, podendo influenciar em todas as áreas.Do Google à 3G Capital, da Zarpos à Berkshire Hathaway, grandes empresas se sustentam ao longo de seu crescimento com base nessa identidade criada. Tal cultura interna pode ser tanto intencional qual acidental. No caso da Heisenberg, arrisco a dizer, era intencional. Intencionalmente obsessiva com a perfeição.A cultura, e não a pureza do cristal, talvez seja a grande inovação de Walter. Em que cartel é possível encontrar um químico altamente qualificado que lidera não apenas a produção, mas ainda a área comercial? Ou então um distribuidor que é auxiliar na produção? Em um mercado que a violência era a única forma de se manter no controle, a Heisenberg inova com a lógica de contínua busca por qualidade como de estratégia para não se tornar substituível.Assim, a obsessão pela perfeição do produto fez com que mesmo especialistas como Gale fossem colocados de lado na produção. Mesmo faturando milhões, Walter fazia questão de ser o responsável por cada etapa, o que acabava o colocando, por diversas vezes, como um chefe de Jesse, ainda que possuíssem 50% da empresa cada.No entanto, é Gus que apresenta o grande ensinamento para os empreendedores de plantão: uma ética de trabalho inflexível, na qual a discrição é mais importante que a força e o trabalho duro é obrigação de todos. Assim, a frase propaganda do show estampa um outro valor essencial para cultura de startups: “Let’s cook”.Consumidores tendem a escolher os produtos que seja reconhecíveis, consistentes e fáceis de encontrar. Esse é um problema constante para os traficantes, uma vez que não é possível criar uma marca que simbolize a droga, pois esta geraria rastros até eles. Entretanto, pelo acaso, a dupla resolve esse imbróglio.Não é apenas a pureza que torna a metanfetamina da Heisenberg tão cobiçada. É, principalmente, a facilidade em se reconhecer o produto, que ficou conhecido nas ruas como “Blue Magic”. Essencialmente, a cor regular dos cristais é transparente, só que na falta de um elemento e sua substituição por outro, acabou, sem querer, tonalizando de azul o produto. Dessa forma, a distinção simples se tornou a referência de qualidade da startup (tão famosa ficou a cor que, no mundo real, traficantes dos EUA passaram Novamente, seu sucesso veio pela capacidade de unir a qualidade, cultura e valor de negócios com o reconhecimento dos consumidores.As primeiras temporadas da série se concentram no aperfeiçoamento do cristal, passando por todo o ciclo básico de desenvolvimento do produto, a fim de alcançar um processo previsível e escalonável. Esse processo é decisivo para a construção de produtos disruptivos, sejam eletrônicos ou ilícitos.Um exemplo um tanto quanto piegas, porém simples: Steve Jobs detinha a fama de ser extremamente difícil de trabalhar com por conta de sua exigência absurda com a qualidade de suas produtos. Essa era a marca dele e que, por dedução, se tornou a da Apple. De geração em geração, o trabalho da gigante americana busca aperfeiçoar o mesmo produto, não para enfrentar a concorrência pesada, mas para seguir a coerência da sua cultura de negócios.Mr. White não age diferente. Junto com Jesse, buscam ajustar sua produção com base em todos os feedback vindos do mercado para atingir um equilíbrio no qual sua demanda é igual ou superior a oferta e custos/risco.A obsessão de Walt fica clara na terceira temporada, mais precisamente, no episódio “Fly”. Quando uma mosca invade o laboratório no qual produzem centenas de quilos de cristais por semana, o químico entra em paranóia e encena, em um dos capítulos mais emblemáticos da série, uma batalha de 40 minutos contra o inseto, sob a justificativa de que “poderia contaminar toda a produção”.Um certo exagero, é claro, imaginar que algo tão minúsculo estragaria tantos kilos de um produto altamente sintetizado. Contudo, Walter deixa claro a sua constante busca pela perfeição, pela produção de algo único. Para ele, apenas com a melhor droga, a Heisenberg se tornaria um império.Um erro comum e fatal dos empreendedores é achar que podem delegar tudo ou culpar algum colaborador pelo fracasso. Muitos acreditam que a vida glamourosa à la Richard Branson vem logo com o primeiro Series A, podendo abrir mão de tarefas simples, porém essenciais.Na terceira temporada, Saul apresenta Fring à dupla. Este fica extremamente receoso em fechar negócios com eles, pois Jesse está sofrendo uma recaída pesada no uso de drogas, devido à morte de um amigo pelos traficantes rivais. Todavia, Fring propõe, após muita negociação por parte de Walter, comprar $ 1,2 milhão de dólares em metanfetamina azul se eles entregarem em apenas uma hora. Walt, então, tenta, em vão, contatar Jesse para que ele entregue as drogas que estão escondidas em sua casa. Enquanto isso, sua esposa entra em trabalho de parto e precisa do marido para levá-la ao hospital. Em meio a essa difícil escolha, Walt abre mão de acompanhar Skyler no hospital e invade a casa de Jesse, que estava catatônico após injetar heroína, busca as mercadorias e a entrega para o traficante.Na escala de prioridades, o advogado está sempre no fim. Longe disso, Walt e Jesse colocam Saul, seu advogado, no centro da decisão. A lógica disso pode até ser meio óbvia, afinal trata-se tráfico: “A vida é curta (a de Walt ainda mais). Evite a cadeia.” No entanto, isso se aplica de uma forma mais profunda na vida de startups do que se dá, em termos gerais, importância, resultando às vezes desastres.Nada mais comum entre empreendedores de primeira viagem do que fazer o contrato social com o contador ou deixar nas mãos de um amigo formado em direito. Advogados (bons) são caros, isso é fato. E seu custo é exatamente pela importância de seu trabalho para o desenvolvimento de uma empresa.Startups que trabalham buscando oferecer novos serviços ou produtos esbarram rotineiramente em limitações legais, insuficiência de legislação sobre o tema e tributações pesadas. Do Über aos crowdfundings, inovação passa pela área jurídica. Além disso, quantos empreendedores que você conhece já sofreram para receber investimento por conta de uma estruturação legal sofrível?Saul não se torna essencial por tirar os capangas de Jesse da cadeia, mas por elaborar as estratégias fiscais para sonegar impostos, apresentar clientes e mediar desavenças.A lógica, portanto, é de investimento. E isso se aplica a todos os prestadores de serviços e fornecedores da sua empresa. Certifique-se que você está com o melhor que o seu capital pode contratar.Por terem foco na execução de um simples plano, os empresários foram capazes de crescer e desenvolver a Heisenberg de forma relativamente eficiente e eficaz, mesmo com tantos obstáculos inesperados e situações de altíssima pressão.O lema “se não pode vencê-los..”, apesar de senso comum, parece ser uma descoberta e tanto para White e Pinkman. Se no começo eles acreditam que podem, pela qualidade do seu produto, estabelecer um novo mercado sem competição ou interferência de possíveis rivais, após o enfrentamento dos gêmeos Salamanca, fica claro que os cartéis e pequenos traficantes farão de tudo para detê-los.Como não há espaço na cadeia do mercado de metanfetamina do sudoeste americano para escoar seu produto de maneira individual, a dupla decide se unir a um concorrente: Gus Fring.Desde o começo da turbulenta relação, fica clara a dica de carreira que Walter nos passa: seja indispensável no seu trabalho, assim, por mais que te odeiem, vão querer você por perto. Isso faz com que a briga se arraste por duas temporadas e culmina no desentendimento dos dois traficantes quanto à tentativa de eliminar Hank Schrader, cunhado de Walt e agente da DEA (Departamento de Narcóticos).Temendo pela segurança de sua família, White forja uma aliança improvável com o arquirrival de Gus (e seu também) Hector Salamanca, tio de Tuco e um membro do outrora poderoso do cartel mexicano. Só assim, consegue salvar sua família das mãos de Fring.Talvez o maior desafio do empreendedor de sucesso seja se manter coerência e o foco no seu trabalho. Capas de revistas, holofotes e o deslumbramento com os milhões angariados de investimento tendem a matar várias empresas por afastar a presunção básica de uma startup: tão rápido quanto cresceu, pode desaparecer.Na quinta temporada, Mike Ehrmantraut, ex-braço direito de Gus, torna-se sócio de Walt e Jesse na empreitada. Sem a concorrência da Pollos Hermanos e do cartel mexicano, a Heisenberg alcança níveis inimagináveis de lucratividade e produção. Distribuindo por todos os EUA e Europa, Walter começa a se tornar tão agressivo e volátil quanto os traficantes que eliminou. Mike e Jesse, então, decidem sair e vender a parte deles por $5milhões de dólares, mas o químico recusa. Jesse, após uma movimentação assassina de White, questiona:Walt responde:Só agora seus parceiros ver o quão longe ele está disposto a ir para manter seu trono.Durante as cinco temporadas, a Heisenberg foi diretamente responsável pela morte de 269 pessoas (sem contar possíveis overdoses e outros fatos relacionados aos consumidores). Uma externalidade negativa um tanto quanto problemática, convenhamos. Nada disso estava nos planos do professor classe média que apenas pretendia conseguir dinheiro para sua família e para o tratamento de sua doença.E foi assim que o sucesso ebuliu a ética de Walter, fazendo-o esquecer o que significava sucesso significa para ele e o que queria, realmente, alcançar.Construída por sonhadores, a gente está aqui pra te ajudar a fazer mais com o seu dinheiro.

My latest professional experience was one of the most enriching of my life. I spent the last 6 months doing an internship at an early stage startup called Jogabo. I spent 3 months setting up their new office in Lisbon and the rest in their HQ in San Francisco. I was Community Manager but as the team was very small (only the 3 founders and myself) I was constantly learning and getting involved in many aspects of the company such as coding or design.Every time I accomplish something significant, I try to take a step back and reflect on it, to list 5 to 10 things I have learned. Today is my last day in San Francisco so, naturally, I did this exercise to clearly see how I have grown. I decided to share my personal development because I think it may be beneficial to others as well.Here’s what I learned:Most of us are afraid of What you want to do is go over these 2 fears that prevent you from meeting strangers whether you’re in the street, in the bus, at school or in a bar/club. Of course you can’t talk to everyone (and you don’t need to) but I believe that people around you represent new opportunities. They’re future friends, co-workers or even girl/boyfriends. I’ve found that many people I encounter are approachable, but they are waiting for you to take the first step. Do not miss this chance.Going to networking events in the Silicon Valley has provided 2 key take-aways. First, influencers like CEOs of companies that have raised tens of millions of dollars are very accessible. Secondly, everyone is here for the same purpose: networking. So why not shake hands with a few strangers in the room? Why not explain to them what you’re working on and learn what they do in order to see if you could help each other? When you do that repeatedly you increase your chances to meet someone interesting. With practice, reaching out to others becomes comfortable; there’s nothing to be afraid of in the end.At a meetup last month I met Adrian the Director of Engineering of You need the right vision to accomplish your dreams. You must also define your values and the ones of your company to guide your actions.I had the chance to live and work with people who endured great sacrifices to share their vision with the world. For instance, before raising money, there was a time when the founders had only $300 in their company bank account. They had to travel the world to find places where the cost of living was low (i.e. Chile and Argentina) so they could afford to keep working on their project. It inspired me a lot and made me wonder: Well, I have some ideas but I don’t have the full answer to that question yet.I also learned that Having a healthy body is one of the keys to efficiency and well being.During my internship we were usually working from 8:30 a.m to 7 p.m at a minimum and even if I loved what I was doing, sometimes it felt long. I need to move and be outside, so when I’m in an office for 10 hours a day it becomes an imperative to do some sports. And that’s for 2 reasons: because otherwise I implode and also because it boosts my productivity.We were doing lots of things to increase our productivity at work like a standup meeting every morning at 10 a.m to talk about the tasks we completed yesterday and what are the objectives of the day were. We were also working on standing desks that we’ve made from I also suggest that you play a team sport like soccer or basketball at least once a week. Soccer teaches you to build trust in your team. For instance, when you make a bad pass to your teammate you naturally say, “Sorry, my bad!”. By doing so, you acknowledge that you did something wrong, which will encourage the other players to admit it when they make a bad move too. Being able to recognize you failed and not blaming others for it makes a team great not only on the field but in an office too. This is explained in a great book I read from You have to find awesome co-founders to make sure you’ll build the right product and that you’ll have strong people to fight next to you in every situation.In the startup I was working for, each of the 3 co-founders was complementary. As the team was very small I got the chance to always be at the heart of the decision-making process. I participated from the conception, to the design and then the launch of new features. I was impressed by the way the founders would listen to each other, find solutions or start from scratch again until they delivered the best outcomes. That’s the atmosphere in which you want to work in for your entire life and that makes you deliver a great product.One other thing I learned in the Silicon Valley is that When you go away from everything you know, you make your own experience and go over your prejudices.When I arrived in San Francisco By being away from your classic authority such as your family or school you realize there is much more than what you’ve been taught. You need to organize your time meticulously to get the most out of every day.First, you should apply both at work and in your personal life the 80/20 time management rule. This rule means that 20 percent of your efforts produce 80 percent of the results. You also have to organize your working day. Instead of answering immediately when a support mail arrived and stopping what I was doing, I allocated a time slot for the support (in the morning at 10:30 a.m, then at 2 p.m and finally at 6 p.m). It allowed to me to be fully effective and concentrate on the day-to-day tasks without being constantly interrupted.When you’re an entrepreneur every $ counts so you’ll have to master the art of bargaining and finding deals for free.There’s usually a time when you I also organized meetups for tech entrepreneurs. I would provide the space, food and speakers. It was a nice way to share our experiences and have a great time! In exchange, I would make people pay a fee to make a bit of money. The last one I organized 5 days before leaving was a great success and attracted 60+ entrepreneurs from around the world.I was always seeking for the best deals at work too. Instead of spending $500 on 20 armbands (to put smartphones into) for a project, I’ve called companies until I spoke with Darrin the CEO of You have to be transparent with your customers, your co-workers and yourself if you want to succeed both in your business and in life.One of the main focuses of my job was to support our users. I’d educate them about the App, receive their feedback and help them when they faced a bug. I ended up really liking helping others and getting to know our users. From the basic support e-mails, I would sometimes end up skyping with some of our most active users to collect feedback and give them updates about new features. I also recognized the I also experienced how to be transparent with your team. For example, when we had an important problem occur on the App, we would do a 5 Whys meetings. The principle is simple, we’d ask ourselves 5 times “Why” this issue happened in order to find out the root cause and make sure it won’t happen again.Give without counting to others and you’ll receive much more.I’ve always been very careful before connecting people from my network together. I used to believe that the more you’re the only connection between two people, the more powerful you are. I changed my mind on this point since I’ve been to the Silicon Valley. People here are happy to introduce two people to If your not moving, you’re dying (unless you’re meditating).The last thing I learned from this experience is that One day a friend I met here called me and said he was at a great event in Las Vegas and that I was missing something amazing. 15 mins after I booked my plane ticket and 3 hours later I was in the plane to Vegas to meet him at the Things happen to you when you’re active and in movement.Thomas JaulinTwitter: Entrepreneur and Business student 

COUPLE Nico and Terry Tuason’s two-year-old child loves to play on the iPad. This prompted them to look for educational games but found only English titles meant for children in other countries, none for the Philippines.Nico, an independent game developer, and Terry decided to make one for Filipino children. The two built Halina’t Bumasa, a startup that will create educational apps to promote early literacy and love for Filipino culture, and pitched it to IdeaSpace, the startup incubator and accelerator of the Manny V. Pangilinan group of companies.Last Friday, Halina’t Bumasa was named one of 10 startups IdeaSpace will be incubating for 2015. The couple got P500,000 in seed funding and an equivalent grant amount in incubation services to turn Halina’t Bumasa into a sustainable business.Terry said they would release the first app, which is in Filipino, in two to three months. Nico said they would sell it for between $1 to $3 since offering it for free and monetizing through ads is not an option because of privacy issues, especially that the users are children.Terry said they would also produce Bisaya, Ilonggo and other versions.Making it to the top 10 was another education-related startup by another couple: FrontLearners by Leo and Elaine De Velez. FrontLearners is a platform for “blended learning,” where lessons are supplemented by digital resources. The platform still works even in areas without an internet connection, via a Wi-Fi access point that broadcasts the resource within the local area network of a school.FrontLearners charges a per-student fee for private institutions but is free for public schools. The lessons are K-to-12 compliant, they said.Leo said the program is also their way of giving back to the country since he and his wife are “iskolar ng bayan,” having graduated from Philippine Science High School and the University of the Philippines, where tuition is subsidized by the government, and getting Department of Science and Technology grants.Leo used to work for Shell while Elaine was with Johnson and Johnson. They have retired and are working on FrontLearners, which used to be UberLessons, full time. Leo said they had to spend retirement money on it. He said the IdeaSpace funding will allow them to implement the program in more schools.The De Velezes have long been working to use technology in education, starting with the use of animated GIFs for Math lessons with math-center.com in 1998 to a portal to share lesson plans and an online review center for Philippine Science High School.The other startups that made it to the top 10 are Businessman Manuel V. Pangilinan told the other startups that didn’t make it to the final 10 not to be discouraged. “Every failure is a step toward success,” Pangilinan said.IdeaSpace co-founder Earl Valencia said the initiative is “another step to creating a Philippine economy powered by Science and Technology.”Valencia said IdeaSpace was conceptualized to solve problems of the country. In evaluating startups, he said they always ask whether there is a need, a specific technology edge for the team, and a significant market size for the product or service.IdeaSpace co-founder Marthyn Cuan said that in this year’s batch, they “front loaded a lot of the support” to startups, making the process the “equivalent to an incubation.” Each team got P50,000 to build a prototype for final judging.Valencia said that this year, IdeaSpace got more than a thousand applications. He said there were entries from 15 countries outside the Philippines.Max is a blogger and a technology columnist of a newspaper in Cebu City, Philippines.

Een paar jaar terug maakte ik deel uit van een bescheiden startup: Twitterfountain. We hadden verzonnen dat het voor congressen en andere evenementen leuk was als ze de stroom van tweets en foto’s op een aantrekkelijke manier zouden kunnen presenteren. De startup ging uiteindelijk door verregaande onhandigheid kopje onder — we hadden Twitterfountain onvoldoende gescheiden van andere, verlieslatende activiteiten en iedereen die er tijd en geld in had gestoken bleef met lege handen achter. Maar dat is een ander verhaal.Wat ik zeggen wou: het was een prachtige ervaring. Werken met een team dat niet op één locatie zit. Investeringen lospraten. Met z’n allen naar Toscane om te praten over samenwerking met een Italiaans bedrijf. Constant blijven prutsen, repareren en verbeteren terwijl het product natuurlijk gewoon in de lucht moet blijven. En vooral ook: zien dat je product gebruikt wordt op bijeenkomsten over de hele wereld. En op je Paypal-account de betalingen zien binnenkomen die daar bij horen.Ik geloof niet dat er een algemeen aanvaarde definitie is van een startup. Maar niemand zal een nieuw restaurant of een fietsenfabriekje zo noemen, hoe innovatief het concept of de producten ook zijn. Volgens mij moet een startup aan twee eisen voldoen: de kern van het bedrijf moet online zijn en het product moet schaalbaar zijn. Hoe meer je aan deze eisen voldoet, hoe meer startup. Er zit wat overlap tussen de twee eisen, maar ook weer niet helemaal. De twee eigenschappen maken dat een startup altijd haast heeft. Hoe digitaler, hoe makkelijker kopieerbaar. En hoe belangrijker de schaalvoordelen, hoe urgenter het is om hard te groeien. Het first mover advantage is vaak enorm. Zelfs als je alles goed doet, dan nog is je levensverwachting als startup hooguit twee of drie jaar als je niet doorontwikkelt. Kortom, een startup is ondernemen in een hele hoge versnelling.Het digitale maakt ook dat er bijna niets nodig is om te beginnen. Met een laptop en een paar honderd euro kom je al een heel eind. “Gewoon beginnen” komt bij startups in de plaats van businessplannen maken en marktonderzoek doen. Verreweg de meeste ideeën komen niet verder dan dat stadium en worden weer snel afgebroken. Geen respons in de markt, toch moeilijker dan gedacht, niet interessant genoeg om serieus tijd in te gaan steken. Van de startups die het redden tot aan een inschrijving bij de Kamer van Koophandel, overleeft een groot deel het eerste jaar niet. Maar dat is niet erg. Er zijn weinig investeringen, dus er is weinig schade. De oprichters storten zich na een tijdje, een ervaring rijker, wel weer in het volgende project. En na een tijdje is er iets dat wél lukt.Veel meer nog dan bij “gewone” ondernemers is daarom bij startups het ecosysteem van belang. Het startup-ecosysteem is de modderpoel waar van alles borrelt, waar evolutie en mutatie en natuurlijke selectie hun werk doen en waar, als het goed is, af en toe iets moois uit komt gekropen. Misschien wel een Daarom is Wat is dan wel nodig? Ik zie twee grote pakketten. In de eerste plaats een pakket maatregelen dat zich richt op specifieke knelpunten van startups. En in de tweede plaats een pakket dat zich richt op de voedingsbodem.Het eerste pakket, het specifieke pakket, zou zich moeten richten op de twee onderscheidende kenmerken van de startup: online en schaalbaar.Het feit dat startups online leven, leidt tot een heel specifiek verlanglijstje dat mevrouw Kroes waarschijnlijk nog wel kent van haar vorige project, de Digitale Agenda. We hebben het dan over zaken als netneutraliteit, bewaarplicht, cookiewet, BTW-wetgeving voor webwinkels, roamingtarieven, privacy, het toezichtregime voor bitcoinbedrijven en ik vergeet vast nog wel iets. Mark Vletter, van Voys Telecom, heeft “Den Haag” inmiddels Het tweede kenmerk, de schaalbaarheid, geeft een specifiek financieringsprobleem. Een startup moet snel kunnen groeien, zonder dat er nog sprake is van cashflow (en een onderpand is er meestal ook niet). Dat kun je eigenlijk alleen goed financieren met seed capital: investeerders die snappen dat het risico heel groot is, maar het potentiële rendement ook. Met andere woorden: dat ze waarschijnlijk hun geld kwijt zijn, maar dat er geen andere manier is. Het probleem is niet dat er in Nederland te weinig kapitaal is, of te weinig investeerders, maar dat er te weinig investeerders zijn die deze startup-dynamiek echt snappen. Dit probleem deelt Nederland overigens met de hele wereld behalve Silicon Valley. De oplossing is hier denk ik niet om met overheidssteun investeringsfondsen op te zetten, of om pensioenfondsen in startups te laten beleggen, maar om te kijken hoe we Nederlandse startups beter in beeld kunnen krijgen bij internationale investeerders.Daarnaast is er nog een knelpuntje in de allereerste investeringsfase: om investeerders risicodragend mee te laten doen ontkom je er in Nederland eigenlijk niet aan om je startup in een BV onder te brengen, terwijl dat op dat moment fiscaal en qua kosten helemaal niet aantrekkelijk is. Het is misschien een goed idee om het wetsvoorstel op de Het tweede pakket gaat niet specifiek over digitale startups, het gaat over een voedingsbodem voor ondernemerschap. Ik ben er steeds meer van overtuigd dat dit uiteindelijk over cultuur gaat. Ondernemen is eerst en vooral een kwestie van attitude. Ondernemen is naar buiten kijken, kansen zien, risico’s overzien en gaan. Nieuwsgierigheid, optimisme, onzekerheidstolerantie en actiegerichtheid. Het zijn vier karaktereigenschappen die er in Nederland van jongs af aan consequent worden uitgeramd. Het zal wel met het calvinisme te maken hebben, of met de strijd tegen het water, maar veel van onze systemen zijn gericht op controle, disciplinering en risicobeheersing. We zijn niet voor niets zowel wereldkampioen telefoontaps als wereldkampioen oververzekerd zijn. Als een Amerikaan iets ziet dat beter kan, begint hij een bedrijf. Als een Nederlander iets ziet dat beter kan, belt hij de gemeente.Het zal duidelijk zijn dat dit niet van vandaag op morgen veranderd is. Als we serieus een startup-land willen zijn, zullen we ons onderwijs, onze sociale zekerheid, ons arbeidsrecht en zelfs onze woningmarkt met een hele andere bril op moeten herontwerpen. Als schot voor de boeg hier mijn verlanglijstje.Ja, dat is nogal wat. Maar ik geloof niet dat er een shortcut is. Ik geloof niet dat er een bloeiend startup klimaat kan bestaan in een land waar het behalen van een diploma en het verwerven van een arbeidscontract voor onbepaalde tijd worden gezien als het hoogste ideaal. Een diploma bovendien dat je kunt behalen door zestien jaar lang precies te doen wat er van je gevraagd wordt. En een arbeidscontract dat tevens het enige ticket is naar een woning en een behoorlijk pensioen. Als we dit soort zaken niet aanpakken, dan blijft een startup (en ondernemen in het algemeen) iets voor twintigers, die zich nog niet druk maken om hypotheek, pensioen en kinderen. Dan zullen we misschien wat incidentele successen boeken, maar we zullen geen ecosysteem krijgen waaruit voortdurend bedrijven ontstaan die waarde toevoegen en maatschappelijke vraagstukken oplossen. Het is nogal wat, en het hoeft niet morgen klaar, maar het lijkt me wel verstandig om morgen in ieder geval te beginnen.Er is ook nog iets belangrijks dat de overheid in de tussentijd zou kunnen doen.Ik ben blij met alle aandacht die er nu is voor startups. Maar je kunt niet leren rennen zonder te leren lopen. Een duurzaam productief startup-ecosysteem vraagt ook om verbeteringen in het (algemene) ondernemersklimaat. En dan heb ik het niet over belastingverlaging of zo, maar over het opruimen van een aantal erfenissen uit het tijdperk dat de wereld overzichtelijk en voorspelbaar was. Op sommige punten betekent dat liberalisering, op andere punten juist een hele duidelijke rol van de overheid. Bij elkaar is het een flinke agenda, maar wel een die hard nodig is.Ondernemer en econoom. Man van weinig woorden. Ondernemerschap en (sociale) innovatie. Thesis One en MIES.

When I first started observing the start-up scene in Malaysia 12 months ago, it was still very much in its infancy (arguably still is). It was clear however, that there were many opportunities for new businesses to be built and scaled in this country.I recall telling several friends and colleagues in the legal profession (that I had decided to leave behind) that there were many opportunities for new and exciting work. The reactions I got were mostly mixed and often negative — “these companies can’t pay”, “not worth the time”, “not sustainable business”.Fee earners were still hunting traditional corporates. I don’t think they fully understood the significance of what was happening and the amount of funding that would become locally and regionally available from reputed, professional investors. Only a handful of law firms were in the scene through engagements with early-timer start-ups, but speed of delivery was often an issue given the pace of the industry.The Malaysian start-up scene has since grown so much, to a point that it has become hard to ignore. Tap into Facebook, see a start-up ad. Talk to your friends, they’ve left consulting to build a startup. Open the newspapers, read about an app to make your life easier. Whether the actual substance coming out of this growth is sustainable is a separate question, but some front runners are starting to show that they may have tapped something real and serious, credible investors are starting to come into this country.It’s therefore ironic and satisfying, to see in reaction to this, how many law firms have been scrambling to get a foot into ‘start-up law’ within the last four months (Today, several law firms are partnering with the Malaysian Global Innovation and Creativity Centre (MaGIC), and some of the early doubters I’d prompted and who had resisted initially, are now even hosting complimentary talks from their law firms on everything from “Understanding Term Sheets” to “Legal Issues When Hiring For Your Startup”.But the skills gap and the approach of legal professionals to the start-up industry is palpable. Used to dealing with traditional businesses and rudimentary exercises, it will take open-minded, flexible and forward thinking lawyers to adapt and be willing to step-up and play an instrumental role in marrying investors with their chosen start-up, instead of hindering the deal process and still thinking they are doing their clients a favour (The reality is that start-ups know they aren’t 100% compliant but a great idea waits for nobody, and their investors know this too (the savvy, break things, growth hungry ones, anyway). The solution is, well… coming up with a commercially viable one that helps get the deal done without unduly stalling it (It’s clear this is a real issue. Some investors are even taking matters into their own hands and (i) hosting their own legal documentation workshops pushing for simplicity and their own vetted templates; or (ii) using foreign lawyers or experienced in-house counsel to advise on commerciality and drafting of investment documents. I’ve received first hand feedback from a regional investor that they were not convinced after meeting certain reputed law firms, that they had the right experience, culture and understanding of the industry.But these issues, while occurring in and through my personal experience in Malaysia, aren’t specific to this country (many other countries in this region are experiencing the tech-boom too) and the purpose of this sharing isn’t to hate. The need for competent legal services in this industry is still there, and very real — I’m often asked whether there are any ‘good VC law firms’ or ‘startup lawyers’ that I can recommend. Very slowly, I’m starting to see more viable options.The local legal industry needs to thrive and innovate, or get left behind. If firms are hungry, dynamic and forward thinking, they will be the rare few that can capture the market and get the good work. Sometimes all it takes is one. The legal industry deserves to be a part of this growth and development, but it can’t expect to achieve this by applying decades of conventional, hard-lined legal practices and behaviour to a new-age tech deal. That’s like trying to find someone on Instagram using their ICQ number.Founder of 

I joined ParkEasy before graduation and it was unexpected. Having considered spiritual reasons, financial needs, family’s expectations, and mentors’ advice, I came to the conclusion that my career path should start off with emphasis on learning rather than wealth and others’ expectations. So when I was called to join ParkEasy, it didn’t take me long to say yes.3 months into my first full time job, I can happily say that We are serious about our work. One of the keys to getting a job in a startup, is trusting the team who are serious about it. It is not about innovating for the sake of being different, it is about creating excellent value to customers. Building something from scratch requires so much menial works at times, and you don’t always get to see the results immediately.I can go on and on telling how we take turn to clean our office, had to work with limited internet, test hardware one by one manually and so on. All these mentioned are still fairly recent, and I can totally imagine how much more each person has to do when the team were only consist of the founders, and when there was no physical office. Working in a startup, is not collecting likes on Facebook and having another update on LinkedIn.Working in a startup, most of the time, also mean getting lower pay than average. As much as I enjoy being an idealist, I still face the reality daily. I properly budget my monthly expenses — that means fixing daily lunch choices to hawker food, replacing espresso coffee with instant coffee, limit amount of social outings, taking more public transport and so on. I don’t complain because I certainly am still thankful that I can be self-sustaining. In a way, this is good because you go for good alternatives — jogging at park, reading at home, writing and so on. Taking KTM instead of driving, I avoid anxious of traffic jam, and get to indulge in reflections annonymously.What keeps us going then? If it is not glamorous and fun? We are holding on to the vision and values we have, and the people in the team who move toward the same goals. The journey itself, is fun.It is so easy to get distracted working in a startup, because the exposures can get quite exciting. While you are writing an email, your co-worker sitting next to you could be working on a deck which is so more interesting and the next thing you know, you are giving suggestions on the content and look of the deck. It may take only 1–5 minutes to get back to your work, and another minute to get back into the focus zone you were before. But imagine this happens throughout the day, and everyday, not good.During the first 3 months, my mind was all over funding (pitch to investors), product development (learn coding), business development (pitch to clients), marketing (strategise our brand), operations (create a cool system like Toyota) and accounting and finance etc. I wanted to get myself involved in so many things everyday. At the early stage of a startup, the founders often have to deal with all. As the team grows, we learn to be focus.The truth is, imagine if everyone in the company tries solve every single problem together- we all learn coding together, pitch to investors together, design operation systems together, ParkEasy will produce a bunch of generalists. By focusing on your main role, you get better and better at what you do. You think deeper, prototype and execute better, and get better insights. Having said that, the beauty of working in a startup is that you have your team to count on. I could be responsible for something, but I can always grab my coworkers to bounce ideas during meetings, and align decisions to our goals.Just like an orchestra, each person masters an instrument, and together we produce beautiful music. We don’t need everyone to know every single instrument.I don’t see working in a startup is more superior than other jobs, nor its inferior because its made up of a bunch of young folks. I think working in a startup is a mix of passion, motivations, matching expectations, cultural fit, suitable skills, commitment and support from our personal and professional network. Without passion, none of the external factors will sustain one working in a startup for long. Having said that, passion without hardwork is never enough. It is a long marathon, where environment keeps changing and it requires much adaptation and persistence.Having set your destination, keep sailing with your team, and enjoy making the process better. That to me, is working in a startup.

Having built and scaled five startups in the last decade, I am fortunate to have been at the intersection of the rapid proliferation of startups and this technology evolution. A trend that I see continuing indefinitely. I have spent the last few years bringing my operating experience  own unique perspective to helping startup founders. I offer unrestricted help to founders whether or not I have backed their startups, with the singular aim to see founders succeed beyond their wildest dreams. This approach has karmically led to an abundance of deal flow and access to even those angel opportunities that are in high demand.With the years I have spent on startups and hundreds of founders whom I have known  continue to meet, I selectively invest when I get to know a team that can have an outsized outcome and make a massive impact on the world. I back founders who demonstrate characteristics  behaviors similar to the best entrepreneurs with whom I have worked or come to know. Founders who have built billion-dollar companies and household names.My purpose is to help people make their dreams come true. I consider myself lucky(!) to be able to focus my energy, drive, and resources helping startup founders create the next generation of world-changing companies.Angel investor.

Communicating your message with The elevator pitch stems from the idea that you should be able to deliver a short summary of your project within the time it takes for an elevator ride, so about 30 seconds. Challenging right? Elliot Loh from 500 Startups suggest you follow this simple Too many startups create products that aren’t really solving any true problems, but rather focus on a temporary market need with the goal of making a quick buck. Look at the evolution of daily deals as an example; the demand rapidly dissipated once the market reached maturity and saturation.“The problem” is your most important asset so it’s imperative to make the investor feel the pain point. Why is this an important problem to solve and how does it affect the end user? How is your product is going to improve the world by fixing this problem? How does the world look after your solution is implemented? Is everyone happy? Remember If you are going for a top down approach, then come to investors with valid research and cite your sources. If you walk up and start saying that the market for princess tiaras is approximately €5 trillion then you won’t get taken seriously. If it’s bottom up approach, then base the market size on your current traction multiplied by users/services over time. How are you going to make money? Recurring revenues or one time payment? Fixed pricing or dynamic pricing? Understandably, this is one of the most important points for investors. You aren’t the only guys and gals in this space. If you are, you’re probably lost. You need to show why you are Batman and everyone else is just wearing a cape. What have you done so far to capture new users and how will this evolve over time? What is you model for growth? Sticky, viral or paid? If it’s paid, how much does it cost you to get a new user/buyer? If it’s sticky, what is your churn/retention rates and how have they evolved over time? If it’s viral, what are your KPI’s, viral coefficient, etc? What marketing channels will you use? How will you apply this model when you enter into new markets? What do you need to be able to realize your project’s potential? What do you need that you don’t currently have and why? I hope this provided some basic insight to creating a great startup pitch deck.

I often get asked by people on how they can improve their chances of getting into VC.Below I have started to summarise my advice on how to best prepare yourself The first part of this series of posts can be found Finding out about job openings is of course only the first step in getting hired into a Venture Capital investment team. During the interview process you are likely going to be asked about companies you have come across that you would invest in if given some money. The following section includes some tips on how to approach this ahead of an interview.Whoever is interviewing you is likely interested in finding out the following:Let’s first understand the main sources of dealflow for early stage tech investors; it is typically a combination of the following in decreasing order of relevance:Examples: intros to founders from friends, portfolio founders or other trusted investors, founders who get back in touch after the investor has passed on a previous round after looking at the company in detailExamples: web research, pitch competitions at conferences, accelerator demo days, specialised tools (proprietary solutions or packages such as Crunchbase, Angellist, Mattermark, CB Insights, Tracxn); blogging about your investment thesis or interest in specific areas (e.g. AI, food-tech, drones) could also be considered as outbound dealflow generationExamples: cold emails from founders, applications submitted on fund website, being approached at eventsIn short, try and reach out to people in your network who might be in a position to refer interesting companies and check where “upstream” (earlier stage) investors have most recently invested.Now is the time to pro-actively leverage your network to see if you can identify any interesting companies not yet on the radar of your potential future employer; one way of increasing the results space of such connections is to Another interesting way to get a list of companies that a given fund you are interviewing with might be looking at is to check which earlier stage investors they typically invest together with. When trawling free databases such as Crunchbase or Angellist for potentially interesting startups, the main issue is typically the vast number of companies in these databases combined with often inaccurate (because of user submitted) information about what each company actually does.My recommendation for dealing with the large number of companies is to With 2–3 trends mapped out in your mind, you can then perform very narrow searches on the free databases to identify companies that could benefit from these trends (e.g. keywords “mobile iOS learning” with location set to “London” and amount raised set to “100k”). Especially startups that have raised more than a few hundred thousand dollars from well known Angel and Seed-stage investors are likely to be already on the radar for other VC investors.Without a VC fund name on your LinkedIn profile or business card, it will be difficult to generate inbound interest from top entrepreneurs (if any). Even when attending tech ecosystem and networking events you would need to be incredibly lucky to meet world class founders telling you about their latest company, hence I would focus only on the other 2 sources.The above tips should yield at least a handful of companies for your investment short list. The final step is then to group them again into buckets along your theses on underlying trends or by the themes of problems these startups are trying to solve.When asked about which companies you find interesting you can then present your thinking as a process ofContinue reading:In future sections of this blog post I plan to include tips on how to:Additions and thoughts are welcome!For updates on this post follow me on Twitter VC Reads for investors

If you’re doing a startup and every time you share your business idea with other people, they start asking “oh, so you’re like [X] company?”, then you have competition.So let’s talk about the idea of competition and how to deal with it.When I started I saved a list of everyone that they mentioned — and 3 years later — I have an Evernote file with 185 companies who were apparently “in our space.” These were companies with similar ideas, features or business models.What did I do with this list?Nothing. I politely thanked them but never really spent any time trying to understand who these companies were.Doing so would’ve been a distraction.Here’s what I did instead.I don’t know if you know this, but 98% of businesses fail in the first five years.So here’s a crazy idea, Every year I check out that list of 185 “competitors.” 60% are already dead and a lot of them have pivoted into other businesses.Even huge companies shutdown, or turn off competing services.Just look at Google Helpouts, which supposedly competed against my startupSo it just really doesn’t matter.It may sound crazy, but think about it! If you can just run more efficiently and be smarter about your business you will be better than 98% of the other businesses.Try not to do things that will cause you to run into a major roadblock or cause a fatality in your business in regards to it progressing onwards.The other thing I notice when it comes to competition is that when people see their competitors do “x, y, or z,” they think, “Oh my gosh, I’ve got to jump quick and do that!”Most of your competitors don’t know any more than you do about what’s going to work!When people saw what we were doing at Clarity, they were like, “Oh my gosh, that’s such a brilliant idea, I’ve got to do the same thing!” I didn’t even know if it was going to work! I just did it because strategically, when I thought through the things we needed to work on, it’s what made sense.At the end of the day, just because somebody announces something, doesn’t mean that it’s a smart thing, that it’s going to work or that you should be copying it.The suggestion that I would give instead is to just talk to your customers. Have a crazy, maniacal focus on interacting with your customers.I do this thing called “smile and dial.” Every Thursday I go through and to talk to 5 or 6 new customers who have signed up for our product. I’ve been doing this for every company I have ever started.The best feedback I am going to get is not from watching what my competitors are doing, it’s by actually talking to my customers!I use the The third thing I am going to suggest is to continuously focus on building an amazing team.I believe that your first 12 employees will dictate the success of your business.Building an amazing team is something that every day you can decide, we need to hire somebody in this area that we are missing a bit of capacity. And that is something that you can do.Focusing on your competitor is just such a waste of energy and time because it really doesn’t matter. There’s nothing you can do to control what they do.You can really just focus on your customers, your team and not going out of business. If you do those things, you will have success.I hope you found these suggestions to be useful.

Sometimes we can get a little wrapped up in… ourselves.I was watching a Blab.im interview of a founder of a media company that ran listicles and other eye-catching stories about startups. I would have been impressed, but he made a couple of comments that made me think he was a ‘bro’ — and not in the good way.Then this happened…Of course, it went over the founder’s head, but it still made me feel a little better — normally I’m impressed by how likeable the guests are on Blab’s interviews.Cofounder of Fittr.

Since the arrival of smartphones on the market, everyone dreams of creating the next big app that will compare in popularity to Waze, Whatsapp, and Instagram.But there is a catch. We are able to come up with an idea that will meet user expectations and needs. Our idea can solve a problem or even creates a new user experience. The problem is that we follow the same old model.It has long been assumed that the ideal mix of a startup founding team consists of a Chief Executive Officer (CEO — that often comes with the idea and the first features), a Chief Technical Officer (CTO — which brings technical expertise) and a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO — that will sell the product to the consumer).Frequently, the CEO can take on multiple roles.When a team grows, you will hire more technical people, designers, marketing people, financiers, office manager and assistants of all kinds.The last to be hired is the Product Manager, yet it is a key piece in the success of any startup.The Product Manager the one in charge of supporting the development of the product both in functional design (deciding if adding features to respond well to a need for the target user) and in its technical development (managing technical teams without being their superior).The Product Manager often replaces the CEO regarding the product aspect, when the latter becomes too busy managing the relationship with its investors or to canvas new markets. Top Management often feels that a Product Manager is a duplicate of the CEO (sometimes called mini-CEO).When big startups like Facebook or Google buy small or medium sized startups, mostly their CEO-founder becomes Product Manager within these groups.October 2015, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s former CEO (2007–2008) became CEO of Twitter again after being fired from his post and then after developing Square, a mobile payment startup.Why was he able to regain his position? Because he is considered as a true product guy. The product was neglected without him. Twitter has not sufficiently turned to the users, who were still struggling to understand or find daily use.Jack reminded us to Like Steve Jobs, who was called upon to save Apple from bankruptcy, his mission was to instill a vision in his teams and lead the ship, focusing primarilty on the product.The first co-founder that any non-technical startuper seeks when he wants to start is his CTO. To do so is perhaps his greatest mistake.Develop a prototype (or MVP — Minimum Viable Product) in order to attract attention of investors, which does not necessarily need to be truly developed technologically.To look for technical co-founder in a hyper tight market, where each developer (from beginner to expert) receives multiple proposals every day, is very time consuming.This lost time is extremely problematic in an area (services and digital applications) rapidly changing. Your idea is already being achieved elsewhere in the world.Therefore, at first you must focus on the product, as it will always be the one who will advance your startup. Not technology. Technology is only a means to make your product. Your users will only see the end result.Start by perfectly designing your product. This is the responsibility of a talented product manager..How do you build a product to show, at the beginning, without having to develop anything?My advice is the following one:Your discussions and brainstorming around the product, market, target, features will be incredibly beneficial.Show them your vision if you have it, otherwise they will help define it.Defining a vision is a critical step. I purposely said a vision and not a goal.Make sure a market exists. Check that your vision meets user expectations and needs.With your CPO, define what your will be MVP.You will have a minimum product to show the first users and investors.They will have no need to download it and will face no bugs.All the while you can continue to search for a CTO. You can get to know him too.And ultimately, you know you have a real winner trio: CEO-CPO-CTO.Working on social conversation for leaders, their audience and brands.

No I don’t think we’re in a bubble.Yes I think we’re living in good times.I believe every startup should dream big, be tenacious, iterate always, and change the world. But whether in plenty or in want, RIGHT NOW every startup on planet earth should take their entire core team to the mirror and ask themselves these questions:· Is our burn rate sustainable?· Rinse and repeat — is our burn rate sustainable?· How much money do we · When exactly do we believe we will achieve customer revenue and profitability?· If the world falls apart tomorrow, what is the probability our valuation is ahead of itself?· What would it look like if our next round was a down round?· If we all had to cut our salaries by 50%, how many people would leave?· How passionate and intense is our entire team about our core thesis?· Would our team commit to five years of doing nothing but working on this startup together?· How have we sacrificed as a team to get here? What else may we have to sacrifice?· Are we proud of what we’re working on? Does it change the world for the better?· Why exactly are we here? What drives each of us?· What mistakes have we made? Find 10 more. What have we learned from these?· Where does each of us need to be better? How are we better as a team than apart?· How did our funding round change us? How has not getting enough funding change us?· Are we leading the company well? Where can we do better?· How original is our core value proposition?· What are the strengths in our product? Cut down to top 3.· What are the flaws in our product? Find 5 more.· Are we impartially looking at the data about our product?· What are the current Top KPIs we look at each day? Does entire team know these daily?· What did we launch too slowly? What did we launch too quickly?· How often do people say our product won’t succeed? How do we respond to this?· Is our product risky enough?· What do our top customers honestly think about us?· How would we describe what our ideal customer looks like? Is this realistic?· Do I find myself using the product because I want to or because it’s my job?· How much time do we actually spend with our customers?· How do we listen to our customers? Do they freely share their feedback? How can we enable this better?· How hard is it for someone to copy our idea?· What do our competitors do really well?· What can we learn from our competition?· Do we have a list of people waiting to work at our startup? Why or why not?· Who in the past have we hired that is not a fit? How did we handle this situation?· How many people do we interview before we hire someone?· When was last time we hired someone who was not looking for a job?· Is the culture we are fostering an attractive one to the outside?· How strong is our customer/hiring/investor network?· When was the last time we met with a new investor?· How often do we listen to advice from other older/wiser mentors?· How often do people say we won’t succeed? How do we respond to this?· Are we doing a lot with a little? Even if we raised a large round?Notes on Changing the World

I studied Communication.At the end of the day, the objective of all my courses was to learn how to activate tools that made a brand or company worth talking about.Then, I worked for large companies. I realized that good communication is done in vain when Culture is not spread into the whole structure.In hindsight, I realize that I left large companies because the process and structure prevented me from being autonomous. Indeed, until recently, I thought that the entrepreneurial path was the only possible way to be independent.I thus began to be interested in the entrepreneurial path and naturally became more interested in the entrepreneur’s path than the product itself.It’s obvious to me that founders are the key. The way they choose to run their company is as important as the product itself. Contrary to all expectations, until now convinced to not be a born entrepreneur, it seemed to me that I was going to begin something on my own.Even before a product launch, even before users are acquired, all companies must be 100% aware of their Culture path. No matter the purpose of the company or the steps along the way, this is the Culture strategy and the company values which will allow the company to be, to grow, to sustain and to be recognized by all.That is why, driven by the desire to start something from scratch, I finally decided to work on the starting point of something:Account Manager brand content  native ad Helping you see the future of your startup.

When I moved from startup CEO to venture capitalist, it was a strange feeling. I was no longer in the driver’s seat. I was operating a gas station, filling up the tanks of promising startups for the entrepreneurial roads ahead. It took some time to get used to not being in control, and not feeling directly “responsible” for the outcomes of the companies I funded. Filling up the gas tank was the easy part (easy in terms of level of stress, not probability of success). The hard part was navigating the winding, slippery roads in terrifyingly thick fog and avocado-sized hail.But with that stress came excitement. That sense of fulfillment you get from building something from ground zero. You get that reassuring feeling that the culmination of the tiny things you do every single day can eventually make a significant impact. That one day you can look back, and the change you envisioned will be real. That… that right there… you made an important contribution to making that happen.So during my hiatus from entrepreneurship, I thought about what I wanted to do next. People asked me whether I would ever start a company again. “I’m not sure yet,” I said. “Maybe.”It took many long walks, discussions with friends, and episodes of deep thought before coming to a realization. Whatever we decide to do, we should always chose something that will maximize our impact. Impact is the sum of all of our contributions to this world. And with more impact, comes more fulfillment.Launching 500 Startups in Japan has the potential to have the greatest impact the Japanese venture world has ever seen.For most foreign investors, Japan is a black box. And that’s a good thing, because there is so much opportunity here for those that understand it. The common perceptions of Japan are that it:In many ways, all of these things are true. But things First of all, to recognize the signals of change, we first have to understand why things came to be the way they are. And to do that, we have to go back to Japan’s heyday. The 1980s.Thirty years ago, the rational path for smart, young Japanese was to join a big company. Because regardless of whether you did your job well, you would essentially be guaranteed a job for life with regular promotions and pay increases as you got older. Joining a big company was all reward and no risk.But that was decades ago, and a lot has changed since then. People that were born in the late eighties and early nineties never saw the bubble era, when these large corporates were at their peaks. They grew up in the “lost decade.” Some would argue the “lost two decades.” Today, they are coming into the workforce at a time when the big “stable” companies are issuing massive layoffs.Big companies no longer offer the stability they once did. So the risk-reward ratio no longer makes sense for today’s smart, young Japanese. To add to this, Japanese engineers don’t get paid anything close to Silicon Valley levels. So if you are a smart Japanese engineer, the potential upside of starting or joining a startup far exceeds that of joining a big company.The perceptions surrounding the entrepreneurial path have also begun to change. Not only have these young people never experienced an era of ultimate stability in large corporates, but they’ve also grown up in a world of massive and rapid wealth creation through entrepreneurship. The Facebooks, the Ubers, and the Airbnbs of the world have created an unprecedented number of young millionaires — not the traditional companies that their parents encouraged them to join.To give you a sense of how significant this change has been, look at a comparison of 2008 vs 2014. The University of Tokyo and Kyoto University, two of the best universities in Japan, saw an increase of 57% and 31%, respectively, in the number of “dorm room startups,” or startups that were born by university students. These are the universities that manufacture talent for the highly coveted jobs in government, banking, and big corporates. In the same time frame, the number of public companies started at universities nearly doubled.Times are changing, but what hasn’t changed very much is the lack of seed capital for these entrepreneurs to get their ideas off the ground. Unlike in the US, or China, or many other places where your dentist might write you a check for your dinky startup, the concept of angel investing is still very nascent in Japan. To give you perspective, the difference is about $167m in Japan vs $24b in the US. For crowdfunding, the difference is even more significant. In Japan it is a meagre $10m vs a whopping $2.7b in the US.Even venture investment in Japan is comparatively insignificant. It is about $961m, compared to $48b in the US — a difference of 50x. So if you do some quick math, there is about $1.2b available for entrepreneurs in Japan, vs $75b in the US. $1.2b is less than Here is where 500 Startups can make an impact. We will be the most well-known seed-stage Silicon Valley VC to actively invest in Japan. No other local seed investor will have as far a global reach, with as deep an understanding of the local market. With our investment, Japanese startups will no longer be stuck in a black box. They get a globally recognizable brand, Silicon Valley expertise, and a network to help them compete on a global scale. We open up doors to abroad for investment and MA never before seen in the local startup ecosystem.To me, that is impact. If there is one thing we can do for Japan, it is to make a material impact on entrepreneurship and innovation. We hope to increase the size of this $1.2b pie. Let’s make it $5b, $10b, and beyond, so that Japanese startups can finally compete on a global scale. That is why we are doing this, and that is our mission for 500 Startups Japan.Head of 500 Startups Japan

Liam’s response time was as fast as always, a day after asking for him to get something made up I had a first draft.Liam warned that it was “the less conservative version” which was fine, taking risks early is how innovate UI’s get made.Liam agreed. After all it was only a quick sketch to get some ideas flowing, not a final piece.A few minutes later I had a more polished mockup to look at, this was much better.I’d have liked to include images somewhere, but we eventually decided in this particular layout all it was going to do was make the text hard to read, so we decided to leave them out.This layout is subtly awesome. Notice the easy access to everything the user will need: 1 click to vote, 2 clicks to navigate, share or get extra info.Putting sharing in a easy to see place encourages users to actually share it, and apps like this need all the extra advertisement they can get.Now i had a basic design to work to, it was time to actually build it! It took me just over an hour and a half to get things looking pretty similar, as i’d already worked on some of the code that’d be needed to link it with my DO VPS. I got things looking relatively similar, there was no point wasting time getting things pixel perfect at this point, changes were still very likely to happen.That was how easy it was to get things from a MYSQL database to parseable data. A nice surprise, I was expecting it to be much harder.Next up was producing a deal info view, something that showed more information about the particular deal a user clicked.Oops, my bad. I probably should have explained the plan a little better before we started.Liam had a power outage for a lot of the day, but still managed to produce this first time. Looks super clean, and clean is definitely my thing.Liam raised a good point. Location was going to be very tricky. Firstly, either the user is going to need to put in the location manually, or the app is going to need to figure it out itself. As we wanted users to actually submit deals, the first option was instantly off table.That meant we had to figure out the nearest store to the user. Luckily Google have a handy API called Place Search, so that wasn’t a problem, assuming of course the restaurant had registered their location with Google.As for whether users knew if a particular deal covered all events, we decided we’d settle for having an option for whether the restaurant was a chain or not, and allow users to add specifics in the “Anything else?” section.I spent the rest of the day turning these mockups into a functioning app. Liam converts the mockups into things like this to make it easier to implement.Linking up with the database was a little tricky, lots of editing of PHP pages and debugging, but it eventually got done.That’s it!We had built ourselves a fully functioning minimum viable product.

Para a primeira edição em Angola do Seedstars World, a competição exclusiva para startups em mercados emergentes, recebemos mais de 20 candidaturas. A qualidade das startups candidatas foi de elevado nível, por isso selecionamos não 10, como previsto, mas 11 startups para o evento que irá acontecer já no dia 24 do corrente mês no Espaço Bahia, em plena marginal de Luanda.Aqui estão as startups selecionadas para participar no Coworking | Comunidade | Colaboração | Consultoria | Eventos | A promover o empreendedorismo tecnológico em Angola

1. Ask a lot about the product/idea. Are they solving a problem? Are there other companies already solving the problem, if so how is the startup you are about to join different?2. Enquire as to how well the company is funded? In what stage of funding are they in? To understand the basics as to how funding works go through 3. If the startup is funded how long will the money raised help the startup run? How is the company planning to spend the funding? Running out of cash is one of the prime reasons why startups fail.4. How many founders/co-founders are there? Startups with more than one founder have a better chance to succeed. Get to know your founders from their LinkedIn, Twitter, FB and other social medium. From their social profiles there is a chance that you can get to know if both the founders have a solid relationship (Work Buddies, College Buddies etc). It’s better that they do as there will always be one who will be constructively opposing the other one.5. What’s the revenue generation plan? Having millions of active users in one thing, but converting that to revenue is another. 1. Are you ready to work for long hours with passion?2. Is there a market need for such product or idea? The prime reason for a startup to fail is the lack of a market need for their product. Do some research (Google can give you lot of data), ask some of your friends/family in similar field and get their opinion.3. Does the idea or product excite you? Are YOU absolutely convinced or sold to the idea?That’s it.From my experience above are some of the questions I wish I had asked before joining a startup. As my experience grows may be more will popup.Tech, Gadgets, Coding, Sports, Food, Movies, Family  A BITSian to the core - That’s me

Most startups hire for a key skill — Entrepreneurship. Do you love unstructured, unprecedented situations? Do you have a crystal clear thought process? Do you have oodles of initiative? And most importantly — do you have a point of view — can you make fast, precise decisions with ambiguous or no data?This last one is a double-edged sword if there ever was one. Let’s assume that you are that entrepreneurial hire. Fresh into a startup, you’re bustling with ideas. Ideas that you strongly believe in. It’s all-good in the beginning. You feel you have a solution to a business problem, the founders agree with you, a strategy is made and the next day the entire company goes to market trying to implement it. It’s a heady feeling.But more often than not, the reason why business is suffering isn’t clear at all. The problem is hazy, data is insufficient, customer feedback is fuzzy, and the market is evolving at a breakneck speed. Above all that, you’re burning cash — so whatever is to be done is to be done fast. Hence, most decisions are made on gut and anecdotal evidence. And there is no reason why your gut is superior to mine. Unless your card says CEO.So a time comes when you, the employee who feels and behaves like an entrepreneur, has a diametrically opposite view about the direction the company should take than the founders. A heated debate ensues. But the difference in opinion is so far divided and so deeply etched in both sides, that no middle ground is possible. That, is when two equal and opposite forces meet -you now have two equally adamant, equally passionate and equally unequivocal people on both ends of the debate. Giving in is not in your nature when you truly believe in what you do. You can’t stand by and watch your company do the wrong thing. But the same is true for the other side too.Such situations are perhaps the toughest leadership tests for the founders. Agreeing to your point of view would mean doing what they feel is wrong for the company. Choosing their own point of view, without convincing you, would mean damaging the entrepreneurial core that they hired you for in the first place.But that’s their problem. Question really is, how are you viewing this situation?Whenever I came across such a deadlock, I found myself divided into two warring factions. A part of me felt defeated. It reminded me that eventually I’m just an employee until the time I’m not a founder. There is nothing in between. But another part of me saw that it couldn’t be any other way. If I couldn’t recede, then how could I expect the founder to! And surely, not doing anything or losing time couldn’t have been better.I would love to end now by telling you that there is a solution! But unfortunately, I still haven’t found a way to reconcile these situations. It was a constant struggle to keep my enthusiasm alive, to keep having a point of view and to keep airing it. I dreaded falling into the corporate ‘boss bitching’ zone, where employees chat in canteens about how they feel the company is doing all the wrong things. The only thing that helped me get through these patches was shifting to my “ok, lets see what happens” mode. I told myself that this is a win-win situation. Either I will learn something new, or I’ll be proven right! That can’t be too bad.Atleast that’s how I rationalised the fact that I didn’t get to decide.Entrepreneurship. Humor.

I’ve spent the last 5 days in London exploring the local startup ecosystem. Over the last few years I’ve been hearing great things about the burgeoning tech community over here so I was excited to check it out for myself. Overall, London feels a lot like NYC 5 years ago, which seems to match up with with the numbers as London startups raised $1B last year, similar to NYC in 2009. Per the below, London VC investments has seen rapid growth over the last 5 years.Beyond the numbers, there are a few factors that feel the same between the London and NYC startups scenes.· Both cities are leaders in many other industries outside of tech including media, fashion, entertainment, retail and especially finance. I met a bunch entrepreneurs focused on startups that touch those industries.· I heard very similar complaints from entrepreneurs that I used to hear in NYC: not enough early stage investors and the ones who do invest in early stuff tend to be much more focused on revenue than their silicon valley counterparts.· There seems to be a real concerted effort by the local government to encourage startups, similar to the Bloomberg administration.· There’s a palpable vibe that startups are the cool thing to do versus finance, consulting and other career paths top students historically did. Much like MIT and Penn, students now join start ups in SF and NYC instead of going to Wall Street, newly minted Cambridge grads are ditching The City for start ups in East London.One aspect of London that was pretty unique is how international it is. Only 15% of the entrepreneurs I met where British, the rest were mainly entrepreneurs with technical backgrounds from other European countries. I’d approximate that a bit over half of the entrepreneurs we fund in SF and NYC are from the US (a good portion of those are children of immigrants but that’s a subject for another post). The fact that London seems to be drawing so many talented entrepreneurs and engineers from the rest of Europe is an especially exciting driver of its development.Another exciting vibe I got from London entrepreneurs is that they generally seem to be “going big”. The knock on many “emerging” tech ecosystems is that the entrepreneurs aren’t ambitious enough. This is not the feeling I got over the last week. In terms of the size of the opportunities they were going after, I could have easily been talking to teams in SF instead of London. I found this super exciting!From an investment point of view, there seems to be a major gap at the seed level or at least what we call seed in in the US. In London, there is a healthy angel ecosystem, driven by the tax credit individuals receive for investing in startups. There are also some great incubators like Seedcamp and Techstars London. On the other side, there’s a relatively established Series A ecosystem made up of folks like Index, Accel, Balterton, Mosaic, Octopus and others. The problem lies in the lack of investors who focus in between on the $1M-$2.5M rounds that Eniac and many other seed funds in the US invest in. Many entrepreneurs complained to me that there are few institutional investors who specialize in helping companies get from their angel rounds to Series A. In my opinion, the London ecosystem would greatly benefit from additional investors who help fill this gap.I love London as a city so it was especially enjoyable to spend this week getting to know its startup ecosystem. I’m confident it will continue to grow and become a real player in the global tech sector. I look forward to spending more time here meeting great entrepreneurs and hopefully future Eniac portfolio companies.Founding Partner @ Eniac Ventures / 2X Mobile Tech Entrpreneur / Mediocre DJ / Travel Lover / Coffee Snob

“Hustle” is the startup world’s latest buzzword obsession.It’s seductive to think all success boils down to a single trait! But the team who works hardest doesn’t generally win.Lots of companies fail for lack of execution and follow-through. But I’ve seen far bigger better companies fall Placing smart bets and staying focused is Let’s do the math: Six people X 10 months = 60 person-months of work. You’re trying to build a $100 million business, or a $1B business. You don’t need to work 20% harder; you need to find leverage to 10X. You need to use those 60 person-months very wisely!All this focus on “hustle” sends founders the wrong message, saying “It’s a game of inches. If you only work a harder, that can make the difference!” And that’s just nonsense!Many of today’s top startups are trying to disrupt established entrenched industries: Uber vs. taxis, AirBnB vs. hotels, Stripe vs. banks and gateways, Transferwise vs. the whole remittance industry. These industries have legions of hard working employees. Stripe is not going to out-work the rest of the payments industry.Okay, you get it. “Work smart.” But can hard-working employees actually I once heard a Ted talk (in-person, 1997, before they were all on YouTube), and I can’t dig up the source. But it was a Harvard professor (Or was it MIT?) talking about leadership. The idea is also attributed to The US military does a lot of leadership studies because they have a ton of data. They give entering cadets a gazillion different tests — intelligence, skill aptitudes, personality, physical, emotional… all the data points you could want. And they have a single, consistent, well-documented independent variable: Performance evaluations, promotions and rank. So it’s the ideal test bed to ask “what makes a great leader”?The study’s authors took all these inputs and did a massive regression analysis to find out what innate traits, from the outset, led to the most successful leaders over the long-term. And for all their thousands of variables, it really boiled down to two traits: Intelligence and hustle.If you score every cadet on those two traits, you get, in simple terms, four kinds of cadets:1. Smart  hard workingObviously smart, hard-working people are wonderful. In-fact, they make the The only ones who scored higher were the “smart lazy” people — because they can’t be bothered, so they design systems that run themselves. And when you’re operating at the scale of the US military, your systems can’t depend on active day-to-day management by a single human point of failure.So what of the dumb lazy people? Obviously a liability to any organization. In-fact, they’re the The worst ones are the dumb hard-working ones. They have terrible ideas, and they follow through! They squander resources and create problems for everyone else!If you’re hiring for hustle, and hustle alone, odds are you’ll end up with some dumb, but hard-working people whom you Every company needs a CFO, it’s a tautology. Ironically, the CFO only manages your company’s As the CEO, you set the strategy. That means, quite simply, you set the goal, and place a series of bets on what your team should be doing to achieve that goal. Once you’ve chosen the goal and have metrics in-place, your constant obsession should be: “What work should we be doing? Are we doing it? Are we doing it well? Are we learning and getting better at doing it?”If you do this well, your organization will get big. So big, in-fact, that you cannot monitor everybody’s work each day. And that means you’re going to need a team of people who make good decisions — really smart people who think before they act.If you’re a VC or a leader in an organization, you have to make important people decisions When you’re talking to candidates — for jobs or investments, ask questions to understand why they made the decisions they did. Are they able to zoom out and see the big picture? Do they understand when they are making resource allocation decisions (spending money, people’s time)? Do they understand both explicit costs and opportunity costs (tradeoffs)? Are they thinking about the end goal, and the best ways to achieve it? Are they looking for leverage and 10X outcomes? These are the sorts of things that help you understand if a person will be good at using the investment you make in them.Follow me: 

What is that? You can’t come to the stag party? Your vacation is an afternoon nap? You have forgotten your girlfriend’s name? Oh, you have a startup. Figures.Come on now, if it was like a regular job, everybody would have a startup! But you aren’t everybody. You’re a daring person with a majestic vision, an unstoppable ambition, a huge energy… and you’ll need a mantra like that when you’re staring at the screen at 2 a.m. wondering how you’re going to pull it off. You do need some guidance after all.These tips are not rocket science. But they will remind you of some basic principles that you should stick to if you want to succeed. Imagine you’re sitting in a bar with the businessmen you admire. You’ve asked them for advice. And this is what they say to you…There are many well-meaning people out there who will tell you to “do what you love” as if they were giving you a miracle cure. And it sounds great. It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy. But how much does it overlap with the thing that you do best?Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres is known as one of the greatest French painters of the 19th century and one of the greatest painters of all time. But what did he love? He loved to play violin. He played it whenever he could. And his contemporaries were merciless: “He thought less of his paintings than his violin playing, which, to say the least of it, was vile.” Even today, the French say violon d’Ingres for those who are neglecting their greatest talent for a minor skill.There’s a name for doing what you like: a hobby. Don’t trade it off for your strongest points. Don’t turn your startup into a pet project. Quite often, love is not enough. You need to have ability, pile up experience and change your course if needed.Don’t be like all those losers who are “misunderstood”. Who do you want to please? Your mother? She’ll love you whatever you do. Yourself? Become an artist. But you’ve created a startup, which means you’ve chosen to deal with strangers.Customers have needs and don’t care about your ideals. They might not see you as a person, but as something that will further their goals. Whatever the case, you must always make the effort and see them as people. Be friendly, accurate and courteous at all times. In the end, what keeps people is service, not price. And they’ll spread the word. Give them what they want and you’ll turn them into your best salesmen.It’s not enough to wait for people to criticize you. Nobody likes to be a bringer of bad news. You should try and make them tell you what’s wrong.How do you do that? Be open. Be transparent about your problems, your struggles, your work in general. You never know what might make people react and share precious info with you. Too many companies are too closed up. You need to show your customers you’re a real person. And one of the best ways is blogging, where you reach out to your community.Of course, there’s no need to act upon every criticism. But if you keep listening, you’ll notice patterns that you should act upon.He may be the most savvy guy around, but a jerk is a jerk. Stop believing you can change people. It’s a myth. Don’t sacrifice your authority or the good vibes in the office (or garage). After a year, you’ll be exhausted as soon as you see his face. And how can you give it your best then?Get rid of the troublemaker, even if your work suffers for a while. The sooner, the better. The simplest way to avoid heartburn is to hire people for a trial period. After a couple of months you’ll know whether you can put up with them or not.If you’re really dedicated to your startup, your colleagues are like a second family to you. You need them to be supportive. And when you’re satisfied, you need to go the extra mile to treat them well.This is the most obnoxious point, I know. You want to work, not to learn. Lifelong learning seems nice until you actually start doing it. The problem is that you usually aren’t learning what you like, but what you must. Reading blogs might help you clear your Finally, you should know as much as possible about everything your team members are doing. It doesn’t mean you have to do all the work yourself, but you can’t afford not to know what’s going on. You run the risk of being looked down upon, being swindled or simply missing the big picture.When an angel believes in you and gives you loads of cash, it’s all too easy to lie back and let others do the work. If your strategy boils down to spending and more spending, you’re heading for disaster. In the end, you’ll have helped three other companies make more money than you. Focus your spending. Don’t waste money on marketing if you can spend on content. Creativity trumps resources.Two words: business plan. Or, if you prefer, just one word: roadmap. Be prepared to make dozens of corrections in the future. Be realistic. Still, when you’re securing the funds, plan for the worst. You should secure an extra third of what you expect to spend.Most big businesses were a startup once. But more than 90 percent of startups fail. Why is that? Well, the reason is trivial. It usually happens because the startup owner gives up or gets bored.Yes, you’ll lose. More than seven times, in all probability. That’s how it goes. And you’ll feel bad about it. It’s fine. Just don’t be in denial, but try to understand why you lost and move on. Hopefully, you’ll have learned something that will help you in the future.For years, there has been a lot of hype surrounding startups. You read about other people’s successes and wonder how they do it. It seems so easy. That’s because those articles and blogs don’t mention the blood, sweat and tears that went into the startup. All those slick businessmen had growing pains just like you do, they just never talk about them.Don’t forget to share the article, thanks a lot for reading and sharing it!Place for new startups! 

This post originally appeared on Just as there are many successful startups out there, there are also thousands of failed startups from which we can take invaluable lessons on what to do, and what not to do in order to make your startup a successful one. Answering the questions of how to make a successful startup comes from the core reasons behind unsuccessful startup ventures. To be successful, you will need your share of luck. But success or failure can be attributed to a lot more factors than mere luck.As long as you make something that users want and it actually solves a problem that is missing within market, then you have an increased chance of a successful startup.Most of the failures are centered towards the very fact that the startups failed to generate enough value for its customer base. Why? Without providing value, don’t expect to see financial remuneration for your product or service.However, this isn’t the sole reason overall why startups fail. Paul Graham, Co-founder of YCombinator, Even with the most successful startup companies you hear in your living rooms today, all started at the same point you are currently on or have passed. The most successfully developed startups cannot be sold to everyone in a large market. That’s why one of the first pieces of advice entrepreneurs should get is related to the importance of defining their target market and customer. This is going to help you achieve product/market fit which doesn’t come overnight, but defining your market and customer base, along with being patient, is crucial for your chances of achieving product/market fit quickly and on to focusing on scalability.Finding the right niche is essential for the success of your startup. It determines the potential sales of your product, shapes the framework of your customer related strategies and defines the possibility to dominate your niche in the very near future.To be the best, you will have to compete with the best. Most likely, you are choosing a niche which is being served by a business with a compelling value proposition. Trying to bypass this competition too quickly could well be counter productive — as you don’t focus on solving the problem at hand. Also, many startups then try to avoid competition and then opt for small and obscure niches that fail to attract customers. You should be embracing competition — that means there is proof — just don’t make your competition your sole focus (I’ve been guilty of this and it just simply doesn’t work).Christian Reber, Founder and CEO of 6Wunderkinder believes that, finding the right niche and staying focused with that niche specifically with majority of your resources, will be the decisive factor for any instant growth.Execute, deliver, and then move on to serving other markets once you have dominated the original target niche.Building startups related to derivative ideas (meaning generating your startup idea from any existing service or application), can be very difficult to penetrate deep into the market and have long-term substance. If we look around, the most successful startups are those which were able to come up with authentic ideas to creating a revolution to a problem in their respective industries.This doesn’t mean you should totally discount creating startups from an existing and successful business model. Coming up with modifications to existing solutions will help you a little to be a pioneer in your field. However, those that come up with a solution to unsolved problems, you can expect they will thrive in the related sector based on situation and market demand.Visualise about the problems that you find within your industry/niche and think of its solution from your perspective. Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook initially only for communication purposes in his college at Harvard. That small platform has turned out to be huge at present. It was kind of an accident, but in many ways it wasn’t — he controlled the right audience from the start. That’s what the growth team at Facebook implemented to reach over 500+ million users. But he did manage to come up with something innovative and minor existent in that time. That is the key.It is not a coincidence that many successful startups have multiple founders. Starting a startup from scratch and establishing it to product/market fit, then scalability to a profitable level, requires hardship and inspiration. It is too challenging to face all the difficulties of a startup journey alone. If you do not have others to share your views and brainstorm on strategies and then actual execution, you will more often or not stay undecided whether your decision is the correct one.(Image Source: Fortune)Leo Laporte, the founder of the TWiT network and host of The Tech Guy and This Week in Tech, is a prime example of such a scenario where he believed he knew everything as a founder, only to find out that he did not know anything about making a viable business: finance, marketing, advertising, and human resources. Did he make it eventually, yes. So it can be done, but you have to exhaust your existing networks to make it happen.Having friends or close acquaintances (former work colleagues, etc.) whom believe in your startup dreams are great candidates to forming a startup together. Trust is key in running a startup. You are going to be sharing a lot together, so If you’re serious about running or starting a startup by yourself, I suggest I think you have to be an Understanding your focus user is easier if you relate yourself to that group. Create a startup that solves a problem that you have been experiencing or have experienced. It’s possible to create a startup that isn’t a niche you associate yourself with, but you have to know that industry from back to front.When you are building a business that will serve many customers, you will have to ‘constantly’ talk to them, collect data and always reiterate based on captured data in your disposal to cater for your first few customers — this is called Customer validation consists of four phases:I highly recommend Sandi MacPherson, the Editor-in-Chief of Quibb, pointed out the error of not understanding her market/users enough. She spent almost 6 months trying to build a product that she realised she wouldn’t even use herself. Test – Measure – and learning about your product/service, and providing an experience for your customers is pivotal.We all have goals in reaching startup success — “I want to become the next Uber”. “I want to build a $100 Million business”. Holding on to one single goal is a fine and admirable psychological trait, and very important as it’s going to be a decisive factor that will help you push through the tough times of running a startup. However, such adherence to the end goal is not a good idea in case of startups. Why? Because nothing is certain in a startup. There is no clear path to startup glory and you need to plan short-term goals.We see this with many startups that plan goals categorically. Startups fail to plan for market disruption. Environmental influences around you are dynamic, the list goes on with many reasons and it will happen to you — guaranteed. You can’t control what you can’t control. What you can control is your planning and strategy around catering towards these shifts with short-term goals. By the time you launch your product, you may well find that the market demand has changed. New variables emerge all the time. You have to learn to embrace that goals change in startup life, and they change quickly.In addition, have contingency plans and be open to changes. The changes will have to make sense and be beneficial for your startup. In Contrary, changing plans too often will hamper stability. Levi Cooperman, Co-founder and VP of Operations of Freshbooks suggests that do not get stuck planning too long. Plan while you can, launch as soon as possible, and make changes as you go.This factor deals with the two extremes of the Well, it really does depend on your goal and mindset. If you are looking to launch a SaaS product, then you may decide to launch it in its beta version (with limited features) quickly, to see how the early adopters accept it. Judging the user experience in the initial stage, you can then build on catering to your customer’s need.On the other hand, if you delay too much, trying to be a perfectionist (it happens to most startups), you might find it hard to catch your desired customers, as your competitors might have already run away with the show (although you can always get them back, but I do believe in first-mover advantage).Robin, the Founder and CEO of Buzzcar and also the founder and former CEO of Zipcar, says that with their second company GoLoco, social online ridesharing, they spent too much time and effort preparing the software. In the process, they were unable to engage with the customers for feedback and relevant data to reiterate and refine for trying to achieve optimal customer satisfaction.Programmers are an integral part of any startup. Therefore, hiring good programmers is very important — but it is not deadly in the But, this porblem arises when business founders look to hire programmers. I’ve seen it happen many times. In such situations, bad programmers may get hired. The reality is, hiring any talent for a startup is hard to find. If you are a business person for your startup, or don’t have technical talent on your team, then you should look to take assistance from a skilled programmer who will help you find the right person for you. Consider them for an advisor role or a ‘ghost’ CTO. You may be able to outsource your projects to the point where you get funding — but again, you need strong advice on pursuing outsource of development work with detailed processes.This problem could be a byproduct of choosing bad programmers because they may only code in one language, or have strong opinions of where you should build your original startup with. The decision to use the best platform on which your startup application will be framed is very important, but not fatal. (Note — Platforms here means an operating system or programming language which will provide foundation for your startup — e.g. Web, Mobile — Apple/Android). If you are able to hire good programmers, then they should be able to choose and advise which is the right platform to work with for launch of your product and future growth. Paul Graham, Co-founder of YCombinator, says choosing the right platform is crucial for a startup’s success, but (note: we know there are other platforms out there — we are just going mainstream for this picture)At some point of time in your startup journey, you will need funding (or the very rare case like The simple answer is, “as much as you can”… but in some cases, more isn’t necessarily better. Although you should raise as much money as your company needs to achieve major proof-points/milestones, overfunding a company can also have its drawbacks (my next factor below).To get the answer of how much to raise for your startup, you should set a specific goal in terms of growth. If you are looking for growth like wildfire, then the cost of producing this growth rate will burn cash very quickly — and this will need to be taken into consideration when raising funding. Michael Hyatt is the New York Times Best-selling author of Platform and also a serial entrepreneur. He encountered this problem when his company growth was beyond his control and the rapid growth consumed all the capital he raised. I mean, it sounds like a good problem to have right? But, growing too fast with not enough cash, can crash your company.Good question! It is quite evident how too little money can damage your startup. However, too much money takes its toll too. If you raise too much from investors, you will have to make sure that the money raised is used and put into overdrive. Before you even consider raising, you have to know exactly where you are going to spend the money for your startup’s growth. Here are a few reasons to take into account between what’s expected from founders and that expected by investors;Money should not be kept idle. You will have the added pressure of using the money raised (without wasting it), and in the process, you will have reasonably strict KPI’s (or growth milestones), where you will have to prove that your idea is still viable for further funding down the future.The larger amount you want to raise, the longer the process will take. Could you be focusing more time on your startup product or service offering? This is a question you should keep in mind.I’ve briefly brought the issue of ‘burning cash’ up in the “Not raising enough money” factor. The other side of raising money is extravagant — the burn cash rate of some startups is significant. When this happens, you aren’t necessarily in trouble, but you are certainly in a more dire state and drastic change needs to occur quickly.One primary reason behind excessive spending is the hiring of unnecessary and unproductive people. Sam Altman recently talked about how some Silicon Valley startupsOn the topic of hiring, hiring people who are not giving you the return you justify, can be a very big issue. It’s just like hiring bad programmers. So, one great way to avoid such expenses is to avoid hiring at all early-on (if possible). Consider outsourcing minimalistic/mundane tasks that need to be completed. Another option for this issue is to hire the people you would like, have serious talent and are passionate, where you can grant equity rather than salary — or a hybrid of both remuneration options. This topic in particular is another blog post for another day as it’s often a ‘touchy’ subject, but it is an option you should consider. Using this process, you will get more commitment from talent you want to hire because then, they have more skin in the game.Another reason why startups fail because of burning cash, is leaving minimal cash supply for the ‘trough of sorrow’ (which many of you may face). This isn’t a scare tactic, it simply means you have to be prepared for the unexpected, and have enough finances in the backlog to cater for this phase and to help move back into the ‘growth’ phase → and then onto the ‘maturity’ phase. Read more about This is a very common factor for many startups. After few years of the journey, one or two founders want to go a different direction — strong opinions start to unravel. It may not be a big deal if the person who decides to leave is not very committed, however, when someone with valuable skills and a member with the original vision of the startup leaves, then true problems arise.Fights between founders are likely to arise when startups are founded by such people who do not really care about each other and do not share the same vision and mission as the other. So, you must not start your startup with someone who have technical skills but whom you do not like or know much. Collis and Cyan Ta’eed, Founders of Envato reiterates the point that, “If you have co-founders, make sure you document who owns what, how you’re going to pay yourselves, and who makes what decisions.”This is a great graphic by the guys at Funders and Founders. Conflicts between founders can kill startups.All startups require programmers who will code — they will go through challenges. All startups require marketing founders which are meant to expand the company — they will go through challenges. All startups require the Business founders to run the business — they will go through challenges. Simple. Founders need to get ‘nitty gritty” and get their hands dirty and execute their core skills in order to get the most out of their startup. Too many times, founders get bogged down when they get rejected or a big deal/partnership doesn’t work out for them. It’s reality. You have to keep pushing and not give up too easily to rejection. They may so ‘no’, 2, 5 and maybe even 10 times, but eventually, they will say yes.Another reason founders need to push is because there are going to be plenty of times where the work is mundane and boring — even though you are doing something innovative and exciting. You still need to embrace processes. Processes are key for business functionality, or your business just won’t simply move forward.There are many tasks for founders — there is so much to do. Enjoy the hard work. Besides, if you super passionate about your startup (which you should be), then half the time, it won’t feel like work.Your ultimate goal should be to come up with a product that your target users willIt also comes down to an attitude towards what you are trying to dow with your startup. Aiming for profit as your sole goal (or even in your top 3), you will lose focus on providing an experience for your customers, which is much more satisfying (trust me, I’ve fallen into this trap too).You will see with any successful startup — they put their customers first, and emphasised this time and time again in the early stages, and now they are reaping the rewards.If you take funding from investors, then they will be an integral part of your startup. But, how much importance should you give them in relation to your startup? Managing your investors has a fine line that lies between ignoring them or giving them the right to give you more control for startup success.Giving investors too much control may cause misuse and redirection of the company against your will — which can be more damaging. You can only make them a part of the decision making process if, and only if, they have the same vision as you have for your startup.It also comes down to the factors of how much money they have invested in exchange for equity — in the overall they play in decision-making processes.Jesse Jacobs Founder, Samovar Tea Lounge emphasises the importance of finding the right investors who believe in your company’s mission. This can be hard, but with patience, it will pay off in the long run. Don’t focus on the financial remuneration, focus on the ‘effort’ the investor is willing to give to live and breathe your startup to global scalability.Startups are a lifestyle. It isn’t a 9–5 job. It’s a 24 hour job. This doesn’t mean you are constantly working 24 hours of the day, 7 days a week. What it means is that you will never stop thinking about something related to your business. Trust me, it’s not an understatement (I know :).There are many startups that have failed that we never hear about — we only hear about the really big failures. There have been many individuals who have started projects on the side and that have failed which we never hear about.I’m a big believer you can create a side business outside of your normal daily job. It’s something I strongly recommend to potential entrepreneurs who want to take the leap of faith and go ‘hard core’ with taking their startup to the next level. Too many times however, they fail, because they underestimated the time and energy it does take to run a startup, particularly if you haven’t done enough research and planning, or even started to make revenue.If you want to run a successful startup and want it to grow, then you will have to quit your day job. However, there is much more you can do on the side, to increase your chances of success.Many entrepreneurs also don’t take into account some of the sacrifices involved in building a startup. It’s something to also take into account too.A startup isn’t just a business, it’s a lifestyle, but a lifestyle with much more purpose and fulfilling. It’s also an incredible life experience, whether you succeed or fail — you can take my word for it :)Hope you enjoyed this blog postEntrepreneur. Director of Growth  Product Strategy at Titan Vine.

En effet, même si l’idée reste évidemment nécessaire et essentielle, elle ne fait pas tout. La mise en oeuvre, le timing, l’environnement et l’équipe ou encore le business model sont autant de facteurs qui peuvent faire réussir ou échouer des entreprises qui ont la même idée géniale.La courte histoire du web a déjà montré des cas où l’équipe s’est montré plus importante que l’idée.

Dans tous ces cas, c’est à l’équipe de prendre la décision importante de réorienter l’entreprise, en tenant compte de ses forces actuelles et de son nouvel environnement. C’est ce qui s’appelle le pivot. L’idée de départ est abandonnée et l’entreprise emprunte une nouvelle route.

Getting straight A’s in school is quite a feat. But getting straight A’s at a startup is a must. From my view at the helm of CommonBond, I’ve noticed three qualities — all beginning with “A” — that differentiate the bad from the good, and the good from the great.Have high standards. For yourself and for others. On the hook to get something done? Be accountable for doing it and doing it well. If it goes well, let others lead the praise, not you. If it goes poorly, be the first to say so. If you do this well, people will find you reliable. And reliability is what will earn you more responsibility as well as all the good things that come along with it (e.g., impact, pay, etc.).What it looks like:What it does If you do this well, people will know you’re dependable. If you do this poorly, people will write you off.You might be the best thing since sliced bread, but if you don’t have a positive “can-do” attitude towards your work or towards others, then you might as well go home (and stay there). There’s a lot of energy at a startup, given the aggressive goals and intense work ethic. It’s a charged environment. The best arbiter of all that energy is a good attitude. It’s what allows us to push the business forward in productive and tangible ways. A good attitude is also a giving attitude — giving of your time and support and knowledge — helping without being asked. There is little room for entitlement or ego.What it looks like:What it does Attitude is the most under-rated of the three “A”s. It goes a long way.It’s not about doing your job; it’s about getting the job done. Those who embody this distinction are the ones who push forward. They don’t let an unanswered email or even a “no” get in the way of what needs to happen. They are flexible in finding a way forward. Sometimes, they find a path forward when nobody else sees one. And then they lead us down that path. Persistence and grit are their two most trusty possessions in delivering results.What it looks like:What it does Emails and calls don’t deliver results; positive outcomes do.A+ players exhibit all three “A”s, not just one or two. And startups only have room for A+ players (the successful startups, anyway). The art of the startup is to do more with less. And one of the most effective ways to do that is to hire people who do more than their fair share — well, and with the right attitude.If doing more than your fair share — and having outsized impact — sound appealing to you, then I’d highly recommend you try your hand inside a startup.Founder You are not a loan with us.

Do you work for (or with) an early stage startup?If you do, you’ll appreciate what I’m about to say.You’re responsible for the jobs of at least 2 people. If you’re a designer, you’re staging product as well as creating it. If you’re a designer, you’re designing and building product. If you’re a demand generation marketer, you’re writing press releases in addition to generating leads. If you’re a mobile developer, you’re building new app interfaces and creating API endpoints.Every day there are an infinite number of things to work on that would have a big impact. But, there simply isn’t enough time in the day to finish (let alone start) every task.You start coming to work an hour earlier, and leaving an hour later. Then your 50 hour work week turns into 65, then 75, then 85 hours.This exhausting reality often results in burnout for both founders and startup employees.Burnout may be inescapable at startups.It takes a team working closely together to keep it under control. At Mattermark, we encourage fighting burnout through four major tactics.I’ll mention 3 now, then talk about the fourth in a bit.These 3 methods can reduce burnout, but nothing can replace our 4th burnout fighting tactic: When someone on our team goes on vacation, they are forbidden from responding to email or Slack messages.Are we crazy, or are other people doing this too?Off-the-grid vacations are hard.No matter how burnt out you feel heading into vacation, everything in your body will tell you to check your email, slack channel, or get some small piece of work done.Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures Unfortunately, you may never fully recover from burnout if you’re unable to peel your eyes away from the screen.Brad Feld of Foundry Group seems to have mastered unplugging better than most through his ‘Spend Time Away’ It may be difficult to pull yourself away from work at first, but you will only be doing your team a disservice if you continue to push once you’ve burnt out.

Wait, what? Don’t pitch your startup?Yup, you read right.You’re probably thinking that goes against everything you’ve ever been told. As a CEO you’re in a pitch, pitch, pitch mindset. Pitch your startup here, pitch your startup there, pitch all the time. Pitch until you’ve raised your round!Well actually, no. Forget it. For-get-it all!You should absolutely not be pitching your startup all the time. You don’t actually have the You’re attending the FounderFuel Demo Day, AccelerateMTL, Startup Drinks or any other equivalent event that draws Angels and VCs. You’re attending strictly to meet investors. You’re thinking you may just meet the one person or group of people who want to invest in your business.In preparation you’ve managed to find the RSVPs list and identified the investors attending that are most likely to invest in your business because they know your space and you think you compliment one of their portfolio companies. You know what they look like, know their names, their most recent investments, the size of their typical investments. You know everything there is to know about them. You’re borderline a stalker at this point! (JOKE)So far so good, you’ve done nothing wrong. In fact, you’re well prepared and you have a great plan. Good stuff!But here’s where things breakdown…You’re set. You have everything you need and you’re feeling confident. You walk into the room and one of your targeted investors having a beer with a group of people. You drum up your courage, march right up to him, introduce yourself and give him you’re 90 second pitch as soon as you have a chance.BAM. You’re done. It’s an epic fail.What? Why?Think of what you’ve done:Most importantly, you’ve surprised an investor with your pitch at a moment where they were not receptive to being pitched. As a result, you’ve likely irritated them more than impressed them, and obviously that’s not where you want to be.Are you thinking this is absurd? Are you wondering what kind of entrepreneur would do this?Think again.I’m telling you this happens over, and over, and over again. It’s happened to me personally and it happens to investor friends around me all the time.And don’t lie: You’ve done this at least once!There’s a couple of fundamental things that led to your failure:Let’s assume you’re equally well prepared for your event as you were scenario #1 because you’ve done the same research and prep.Here’s how a smart entrepreneur would tackle the same event:The goal of the entrepreneur in the first scenario was to pitch their business, but the goal of the entrepreneur in the second scenario is to start the relationship, get their business card and setup a follow-up discussion.If you have their card, it’s up to you to setup the meeting. This is ideal because you want to pitch them in an environment where you have their undivided attention and focus.It’s as simple as that. Your goal when meeting an investor at an event is is to get their card. Period. It’s simple. And more importantly it’s a formal invitation to pitch.I’m not saying don’t ever pitch at an event…I’m saying pitch an investor at an event if they ask you what you do, but give them just enough to capture their attention, catch their curiosity and get a card.As an entrepreneur you want the investors in the room to remember you, just you!

Choe is a graffiti-style artist by day, and a gambler by night. His biggest win, however, didn’t come from slots or the baccarat table. The artist’s estimated $200M+ fortune comes from a job he took in 2005, in which he painted a mural on the walls of a budding Palo Alto startup called Facebook.Instead of being paid in cash, the artist was paid in stock options. For Choe, this risky move happened to have paid off in an absolutely massive way. This isn’t always the case. As a matter of fact, it rarely is. Many people who have stock options don’t see any return at all. So, what is a stock option? How do they make people so rich? How do you get your hands on some?In this inaugural episode of Data Point of the Week, RJMetrics CEO Robert J. Moore answers these and 13 more questions about employee stock options. Find out how stock options have made some people very rich, while leaving so many others with nothing at all. Hosted Business Intelligence and Database Analytics

And this is exactly why you should go — accelerators are there to make you investment-ready and will help you get in contact with relevant investors.If you already know how to talk to investors, raise more capital and have your own investors lined up, be careful not to give away too much equity. If you think being an entrepreneur means high salaries right from the start, delegating every task and sipping cocktails on the beach while the business takes care of itself, dont go.

Then he sold it — to actual “So while I couldn’t build software, I used the tools I Since So what did he do?He built a spreadsheet that could analyze your sales pipeline, and he specifically targeted SMBs at first. This posed a few unique challenges, namely:Fred goes on to send the message to founders that there is no silver bullet to gaining startup traction and proving that to yourself OR potential investors.“There are lots of examples of that 13-year ‘overnight’ success. Rovio is a good example with Angry Birds, where that was actually their 47th game or something … But this was a grind. I called hundreds and hundreds of companies.”It’s a reality check from a guy who did whatever it took to make initial progress and validate the market.In the podcast, Fred openly shares how he scrapped his way towards actual paying customers without any tech whatsoever (and how this affected his eventual technical and product co-founders, as well as fundraising from VCs). He details how difficult this was and, looking back, what he’d do differently.He also shares the biggest mistake entrepreneurs make trying to gain traction for their tech startups.Expect episodes every other week for this narrative-style, story-driven podcast about all the creative, clever, and brilliant ways entrepreneurs make early progress.Other stories told including the founding of General Assembly, NatureBox, and LinkedIn (plus what it’s like to work with Elon Musk and Reid Hoffman).High conviction, hands-on seed investors | A craft brewer approach to VC | Partners: A curated collection from all NextView Ventures sources, dedicated to seed-stage startups and entrepreneurship.

Moving to a startup will be everything you have imagined it to be. It will be long working hours, unstructured work environment, lack of resources and so on. Coping with these is the (relatively) easy part, since you’ve already anticipated them. It’s the small, everyday things that will most probably get to you. Here are some of my personal favorites:I will talk about these things in more detail in future columns. But if you look closely, all the above examples are manifestations of a single, fundamental problem.Depending on how you view yourself, the narrative of your journey changes completely. If you feel that you are as much the founder as the real one, all the above problems suddenly vanish. So what if you slept late, its your job to set the right example too — you’d better get up on time. Yes the bills are piling up, but that’s the cost of starting up. Every entrepreneur has to account for personal expenses when she is starting off. And weekends — what weekends? People in jobs want to switch off because they hate what they are doing and need a day when they don’t have to even think about it!Two years of working in a startup, and I came to realize that switching to a startup, and staying there, is worthwhile only if you can change this narrative. I’ve seen people who jump thinking they will give 120% of what they used to as an employee. But that doesn’t work. Disillusionment sets in. And why shouldn’t it — the hours are longer, resources are scarce and the money is lesser! Only a mad man can rationalize such a situation. Or an entrepreneur!PS: Flipkarts of the world don’t qualify as startups in my definitionEntrepreneurship. Humor.

here’s a dark side to it. Valuing a start-up company seems all but a linear exercise. Standard academic models fail to provide a solid and unequivocal ground. Many of the valuation pillars are simply untraceable in the perilous realm (mostly valleys, hills and roundabouts) of start-ups. In other words, relative or intrinsic valuation models struggle before non-existent revenues, staggering expenses, negative earnings and a modest survival rate.I sat with Professor Damodaran once. It was during a corporate training in a NYC hotel somewhere in Midtown Manhattan. His honest and rigorous approach was an essential part of my education on the subject and helped me navigate beautifully even the most challenging aspects. His detailed approach helps us confront uncertainty, but does not help eliminate or reduce it.However fascinating the role of a clairvoyant, I suggest we limit our numerical estimates to a few variables only (revenues and probability of failure, for instance) and focus, instead, on qualitative aspects to formulate a strong and compelling investment thesis (A small software start-up has developed a Let’s see what a 30-million-dollar check can buy.Following Damodaran’s approach, based on a detailed estimation of By and large, regardless of the framework we choose, start-up valuation remains a tricky business. As the company grows defining historical performance and strategic identity, late investors can rely on a broader set of data to produce a more accurate estimate of the company’s future (possibly realizing a smaller return on their investment).Seed and early stage financing is fundamentally a statement of vision. It consists of a brave dive into the challenges of our future. Crunching whimsical forecasts in search of the perfect estimate (which is imperfect by definition) we might misconstrue more fundamental questions, to only realize later that the difference is basically a matter of rounding.While we question the blind Tiresias in search of Into technology and startups, publishing, innovators, Empires.

First things first. A startup needs no introduction to most of us and is exactly what it sounds like, a new company that has just been started. An MNC is a Multi National Corporation with a lot of corporate lingo to go with it.I keep hearing this whenever I meet friends or family.“What! You left the job at BBC? Why??!!”I even hear whispers about how ‘stupid’ and ‘impulsive’ I was to take the pay cut and join a startup. The older ladies would bob their heads in silent disapproval and some would ask,“What the hell is a startup?”Of course, now after 7 months I have mastered the art of conveying what But let me tell you, it is the best decision I took. Why? Not just because it gave the gossiping lot something to talk about.I think we all feel rather proprietary about the company because it feels like our own, so much so that we think it’s perfectly normal to lecture the CEO about how to run ‘our’ company.The dynamics of working for a team will be totally redefined in a startup.When I was in the BBC, I did not know anyone besides the cameraman personally enough to feel the connect in terms of work. Sure we went out, had fun, drank a few pints; but we never really felt that deep intense connect to the job. Things outside of work may have kept us connected, but not things at work. At least not in a good way. Complaining about high-handed corporate policies maybe, but nothing about how to improve and innovate.But work here is not about being in the office and clocking in the hours. It’s about relearning the ropes of doing something that you thought you were good at. It’s about discovering that the little things you took for granted mean so much. It’s about realigning your entire thought process.I have always been into writing and have held jobs where the only thing I do is write. What happened to my words is something that I had been trained to ignore.Whether people were reading it, sharing it, and was traffic being driven as a result of what I was doing, were questions that I was happily ignorant of.Now I had to think of these things.It is immensely difficult for a writer to think of anything besides the glory of writing when they are creating content.For writers and journalists working with established MNC’s, there are prescribed formats, which they need to follow. The marketing and use of your content are some things that you as the writer don’t venture into and are blissfully unaware of.Here I do.It has changed my perception of writing. I now re-evaluate every thought when it comes to some content I’m creating. Will people read it? Will they love it? Will there be ROI? Am I completely useless? And a range of other things that go beyond what I am comfortable doing.And the more I think about these things, the more challenged I feel. Sometimes in a rage inducing way, but mostly in a positive way.This job has also made me understand the importance of being open to new ideas, being open to new learning and increased my acceptance levels in general. If someone told me a year back, I would be learning and really trying to understand photography, I would have guffawed at their silly expectations. Now you should see me. Spending hours on Pinterest and trying to replicate that with my highly amateur photography skills.I am always thinking of work. Things that I can do to add value to this firm. I feel like I’m not doing enough, always. Not because anyone tells me off, or makes me feel I haven’t done enough. But because I want to do more.That’s largely because of my team. It would be an understatement to say I love, love, love the team. Not one person is thinking of this as Cherian’s Cucumbertown, or Arun’s Cucumbertown. It is OUR Cucumbertown. And that thought, just that thought, makes all the difference.And I particularly love the fact that there is nothing that you don’t have to do. From playing interior designer to being the make-shift gardener and barista, you are exposed to every nitty gritty of running a company. And for me that has meant personal growth. The word ‘last-minute’ takes on a whole new meaning when you are in a startup. But that’s the fun. That’s the growth. and that’s the essence of working for a startup.But don’t join a startup if you don’t firmly believe in what the startup is about. I admire the vision of Cucumbertown. I connect with the world of cooking, writing and blogging. If I did not believe in it, I would probably think of it as just another job. And working for a startup is certainly not ‘just another job’. And that’s exactly what makes it special.So if you are the sort of person that wants to be unnoticed in the corner of a corporate office, please don’t join a startup. But I like my roller coaster rides, and I love my Cucumbertown.Cucumbertown, this one goes out to you. For spoiling me silly. For challenging me always. For making me grow and learn. For making me love my job. And for giving me a lot of friends who I know I can count on.Journalist, writer and dreamer.

This in the first of a range of posts detailing the start to finish of my first real startup, I had my first venture capital meeting booked in, and i was really excited. The meeting was with Anonymous Person, a early investor in Sunrise calendar. A few days prior I had sent him an email about wanting to expand Today Calendar, an Android app i had been working on for just over a year. I thought he’d be the best place to start, given his Sunrise experience. He replied on the 7th and we setup a meeting for the 10th using Sunrise’s fancy “Meet” system which then was currently in a limited trial.Meet was awesome. So awesome in fact that i spent the next 2 days cloning it as best i could. Things like meet usually require a backend server, a luxury i didn’t have, but i eventually got it to work by sort of piggybacking on Google’s sync server.Today’s the day of my VC meeting. Anonymous messaged me to say he was going to be 15 minutes late. I decided to use this time to prepare a list of talking points, even though he’d already said it wasn’t required. I wrote down a few goals, previous accomplishments, how much money i think i needed to reach an “inflection point” (Yeah i had to look this up too). Today also happened to be the day the internet in my house decided to go to crap, of course. 15 minutes later, during the first few minutes of my first time chatting with someone important, the internet died completely. Great.5 minutes later, the internet is back. Anonymous has sent me a few messages asking if i’m coming back, i rejoin the hangouts chat and we decide to switch to a audio-only Skype call. Anonymous and I chat for probably 10 or 15 minutes. Anonymous seemed mildly impressed with Today’s figures and previous accomplishments, but maybe he’s just a nice guy. He thinks the amount i wanted to raise ($880k) was a totally acceptable amount. He asks me how i plan to grow, I tell him through climbing the rankings in the various app stores, and through organic word of mouth growth. He spends what felt like forever pondering, and eventually said that due to it’s lack of social features, that huge growth was going to be very difficult, i agreed.Anonymous says he can’t invest because he’s backing the Sunrise team to make the best calendar experience possible, but he think’s I’m doing really well. He knows the Sunrise guys from previous projects and pretty much says he’d follow them anywhere. Anonymous asks if i’ve got any questions. I asked a few simple ones but couldn’t think of the important ones. We say bye and i’m left to reflect one what’s just happened. An hour later, i take advantage of my window if opportunity with Anonymous (VC’s are very hard to get hold of) and send him a follow up email. I thanked him for the meeting and asked him 2 important things:Anonymous followed up a day later:This was awesome, Anonymous thought i might be able to raise the money elsewhere if i try hard enough! Still though, what he said about the lack of social growth was playing on my mind already..

Yesterday, I was at the Maisons-Laffitte racecourse. There were 8 races with up to 16 horses per race It’s always the same story: depending on the pedigree, on the current and past performance, on the trainer, one can predict the probability of success of a racehorse. This is why there is always a consensus on the top 2 or 3 favorites in each race.However, this is just probability. Depending on the condition of the field, the weather, the places in the starting blocks, as well as the physical condition of each horse and the strength of the competition that day, it is impossible to give a certain pronostic.You see the potential of a racehorse during the training. Then, you identify him as a potential winner during the first races Entrepreneurs are very similar. Their pedigree and their learning curve will tell you about their potential, as they are executing and scaling, within a market and among competitors, you will determine whether they have a chance to win or not, and time will reveal if you have a real winner… The question is: at which scale?Partner at Kima Ventures | Nurturing European Entrepreneurs w/ Education, Unfair Advantages and Capital

And avoid killing yourself along the way.Like many other things in life, there is an easy way, and a not-so-easy way. We focused on building Over the last few years, I’ve curated a list of about five hundred angel investors, venture capitalists, and funds. Nearly every time I saw one mentioned, or heard one in the media, or read about one in a book, I jotted their name and fund down. I put them all in one shared Google Doc, which included standard columns such as contact info, current status, etc. Very quickly though, we realized that this just wasn’t scalable as the dialogues with dozens of investors became more dynamic. So, we moved to a CRM known as It was free for the first two hundred and fifty contacts, which we quickly filled up. Even after that, though, it was only a few bucks per month. (We pay $12 per seat.) We could organize all of our conversations into a pipeline, giving us the tools to analyze a snapshot of our fundraise status, points of friction, and data we could use to improve our conversations. Closing a round should be treated like a sale because you are in fact selling bits of your company in exchange for money. Setting up a solid sales funnel ensures that the velocity of the deals stays up.Some investors move the needle more than others. They are talked about more, come up in conversation more often, and are household names, at least in the startup space. Investors like Most investors have investment philosophies. They have specific industries that they invest in, or even those that they don’t. It’s important to know the types of companies any prospective check writer works with, so as to not waste your time, nor theirs. We identified that about fifty of the investors on our list had written checks in a similar space as ours. We had to ask ourselves, “Who is showing interest in our vertical, the on-demand app space?” Those who financially backed startups like On the In other words, cold emails don’t work for him. He notes that his fund doesn’t have a specific policy against this, but they have realized that the likelihood of an investment coming from outside of the network is virtually null. It’s not a knock on good ol’ fashion hustling, but it’s an important indicator that sheer hard work and force alone will not always work.You’ve got to treat your investment approach not as a blunt instrument, but a surgeon’s scalpel. Understand where your time is valuable; cold pitching a firm that has never invested outside of their network is probably not a wise use of it.Every investor in our database went through a similar process for us. On a first degree, we’d look them up on LinkedIn, and note the mutual contacts, if any. If that didn’t yield any results, we’d look at the investor’s portfolio of investments, where we’d search for a company where we knew the founders. To get some visibility on an investor’s portfolio, we used a combination of the fund’s website, We value the time of the people in our network, so we didn’t want to just bombard them with a string of introduction requests. Here’s how we got around that. As we made our way through our list of investors, we would note all of the potential mutual contacts in the CRM. After we had gone through our list, we could search for a particular friend’s name, and see all of the investors that we hoped they could connect us to. Doing this allowed for two things:1) We would prioritize introduction requests. Generally, we would ask for just one introduction, cherry picked from all possible connections. In some rare events, especially with close friends, we’d give them a small list and ask who they were most comfortable introducing us to. Who where they the closest with?2) Having this visibility allowed us to balance the requests. We moved them around in such a way to even out the ask amongst our friends. Instead of one friend getting ten requests, ten friends got one request.This is kind of more of an etiquette play than anything else, but I must stress the importance of always allowing an easy way out when asking for an introduction. We always give a way to politely deny our request. Perhaps the connection isn’t strong, or perhaps the request wouldn’t be appropriate or warranted. It’s important to avoid placing your friend in an awkward place of having to say “No, I can’t.” Give them that easy out from the beginning, and you’ll both be better off.All else being equal, it is much more effective to go all in for a shorter period of time, rather than to stick one foot in the water for a longer period. Everything should be done to create a dense period of investment activity. Traction creates momentum, which continues to fuel the fire. As one friend put it, “You’ve got to present the fact that you’ve captured lightning in a bottle, and the time is now or never to invest.” The rocket ship is leaving, it’s time to get on board.As I aforementioned, we were making significant traction in obtaining introductions to the investors on the list. But, the inverse can also work. We went through our closest friends and asked ourselves questions like:In doing this, we added new, qualified investors to our list.Stay tuned I wrote the book on 

We are among those who believe that entrepreneurship is the lifeblood of innovation, progress and future job creation. The world moves at supersonic speed today and new ventures are exceptionally placed to take advantage of the opportunities being created.However, while starting a new company (especially in tech) has never been easier, and cheaper, the challenges of building a real company remain the same. It is often said that 9 out of 10 new ventures fail. Regardless of what the number actually is, the odds remain against aspiring entrepreneurs.Risk will always be a component of building something new, but we think that the risk can be mitigated, and the odds improved, by taking a different approach. At Building a successful company is a long and in most cases exhausting endeavour. Few entrepreneurs manage to build one successful company and even fewer go back to building a new one once they are done. Some become angels or VCs (which is a welcome fact) but the truth remains that most new ventures are started by rookies who only get to benefit from the advice of experienced entrepreneurs-turned-investors if, and when, they are able to demonstrate a certain degree of traction on their existing products. It can be argued that this is a useful example of “survival of the fittest” but a lot of good ideas, and a lot of energy get lost in the process.We believe that starting new businesses is a discipline that can be mastered. There are plenty of resources available for entrepreneurs today, but the gap between theory and practice remains wide. In order to retain critical knowledge and expertise, a core team of people should dedicate themselves to the sole purpose of mastering the process of starting new businesses. That can be achieved only by going through the cycle over and over again. We are well aware that the task of building a business is not over once the first few steps are taken, but the importance of those first steps is such that it is worth dedicating to that alone.A second aspect is the ability to reduce execution risk in the early stage of a company. A new venture has a lot of moving pieces: the idea itself, the execution of it, the initial team, the ability to raise capital. Each component presents great risks and the ability to eliminate, or at least mitigate, some of these can have a great impact on the final outcome. We think that execution risk can be largely eliminated by creating the conditions to have experienced teams working on new ideas.Entrepreneurship is gaining popularity. For many is even becoming excessively “hyped”. Generally speaking we think it is good that more talented people see starting a new business as an attractive path, but the reality, especially in Europe, is quite different. Starting a business is generally perceived as “too risky” and only a few people, mostly very young and tech minded, decide to take the proverbial plunge.The result is a population of entrepreneurs skewed towards the very young and inexperienced. While this is not a problem in itself, it is certainly a shame that a lot of potential entrepreneurial talent is “lost” in the trap of the safe choice (how “safe” this choice actually is would deserve another long discussion). Again, it might be said that entrepreneurship is not for the risk averse. We are less judgemental and think that creating the right conditions to attract a new breed of entrepreneurial talent (the experienced professional, the 30 and even 40 something, the ones with a mortgage to pay and, yes, the risk averse) by lowering the perceived risk is a win-win.We think there is much to gain for both the companies being started and their investors. Stronger managerial experience, stronger networks, deeper knowledge about the inner workings or large companies (especially important in B2B plays). By creating an attractive environment for experienced professionals we can stimulate the creation of companies that address “unsexy” problems previously untouched by tech, problems that require the experience of having worked in a specific sector or industry to even be aware of their existence. We see a great potential for what has been dubbed “the full stack startup”. For that to happen it is vital to attract entrepreneurs with deep sectoral experience and we believe that our alternative model can make a difference .A separate talent problem is the recruitment of expert resources like developers, designers, marketing professionals. In our experience it is extremely difficult in the early days of a company to attract these much needed resources. Like above, most people would not join a startup before meaningful financing is obtained, most VCs would not finance a startup with no product or market traction. Allowing entrepreneurs and ideas to access expert technical talent early on can break this vicious cycle.It is clear that failure, and the fear of it, remains one of the greatest hurdles preventing more talent to answer the entrepreneurial call. A lot is being done to change this perception but especially in our part of the world failure remains a stigma and very few people get the luxury of a second chance (in the form of capital, energy and moral support).A startup is normally defined as “entity in search for a repeatable business model” and while all types of companies can fail it is obviously in the early “search” phase that the risk is higher. A possible solution is to promote an environment where ideas fail, not people. A risk-free zone where early stage experimentation is possible and where admitting that something is not working should not be associated with personal failure, morally and financially. Silicon Valley has managed to externalise this problem by creating a broader ecosystem where the idea of testing something and failing in the process is part of the status quo. An alternative, better suited to other realities, is to internalise it within a structured setup, for example a company. A company that builds companies.The other side of the coin is what to do when things do work. Entrepreneurs who have tried it know that raising capital is a full time job and takes a disproportionate amount of energy out of the process of building a business. The same setup should have the ability to finance projects that move beyond predefined gates. Mixing the ability to fail with the certainty of being financed can provide an answer to the failure dilemma.Founders is our attempt to build an alternative model for financed entrepreneurship along the principles outlined above. Here is how we are doing it:1) 2) 3) 4) 5) 6) We are not alone doing this. In different shapes and forms the “studio” or foundry model has gathered momentum especially in Europe. We haven’t taken the time to truly understand the different variations and we are sure that there are many experiences out there which we can learn a lot from....Be intent on action, not on the fruits of action; avoid attraction to the fruits and attachment to inaction!A startup studio is a structure whose aim is to repeatedly build companies, thanks to its infrastructure and resources.

Evaluating a offer at a startup is hard. I’ve done it a few times now (worked at 4 startups) and a bunch of friends have asked me for help with this. This post repeats what i’ve shared with those friends, from the perspective of how I would evaluate an offer.First, I try to understand what attracts me to the startup in the first place — it’s usually a combination of factors like team, product/technology, market, my role, and potential financial upside. This is usually a quick process that helps me decipher how i’m really feeling about the startup, and can also help identify biases.Then, I try to work to answer some key questions:None of these are easy, but here is how I would try to answer them.The co-founders are absolutely key in an early stage startup. They have set the direction for the company, define the culture, are responsible for attracting funding, and most importantly, attracting other employees. Unless I know the team from having worked with them in the past, i’ll spend considerable time talking to them and understanding how they think/operate, whether I can trust them, respect them, and whether I enjoy interacting with them. It’s useful to brainstorm a problem with them (e.g. a technical design problem or even a product/market one) since that gives a rough sense of how they think and how it was to work with them. If feasible, i’ll work with them for a week or two on a real problem (many startups are open to this because it helps them evaluate me too). And the team includes other key employees at the company and people I expect to work closely with.It sometimes makes sense to do reference checks, but that can supplement, and not replace, conversations with the team.The next thing is trying to figure out what part I will get to play. I want to be in a place where I can leverage my strengths, make lots of impact, and become a valuable member of the team. But it’s also important that I will get to do things that I want to.This is also where I try to figure out whether the work-life balance will work for me.Figuring out role also comes from getting to know the team, their structure, their priorities, and their plans for me. Once I have a sense of what role I want to play, it’s key to discuss that with the founders and make sure we all agree.What does it even mean for the company to ‘do well’? For me, it usually boils down to:It’s great to be in a place that does well on all of these. Keep in mind that any startup will struggle on some of these at any point of time; but a startup that struggles on all of these fronts is not a good place to be (unless you’re coming in to change that!)It’s really hard to evaluate this one too. If you know the product, the team and/or the market, you have some ways to evaluate this (and if you don’t, then, why are you joining this startup anyway?). The founders will be happy to talk through this — after all, this is how they pitch to investors. Definitely try to talk to other folks who understand the industry and potential customers of the startup, to get their unbiassed perspectives.If the product exists, use it to see what you think about it. If you have feedback on the product, discuss it with the team. This also helps you understand how they think about product and prioritize things.There is no point joining a startup (or any company for that matter) if you don’t expect to grow there. A startup often presents the following growth/learning opportunities:I ask myself — If the startup were to shut down in a year, how would I be placed in the job market. While this isn’t the only way to assess personal growth, it makes it easier for me to think about it.This is usually the first thing people ask me about. That’s because it’s the least understood and engineers (like me) are attracted to numbers over less tangible things (how much is ‘team’ worth anyway?). It’s last on my list on purpose because it only comes into the picture if the other factors aren’t in doubt.So, how do you think about an equity percentage?Yes, I know that it’s still hard to evaluate that offer. But I hope that this is a useful framework to think about it.And if you’re a friend looking for advice, I hope I managed to cut short our call by an hour :-)

After finding the right partner, coming up with a nice landing page and delivering a working product I couldn’t be more excited. I caught myself in the middle of the night trying to come up with sales strategies and channels.It’s time to put our assumptions to the test.This means I have no more excuses to postpone the sales stage. Starting from today everyone I talk to will learn about our product. I will actively reach out to potential customers and try to make them buy. Every time I get rejected I will learn something about the future of this business.I’ve read a thousand posts about why setting goals is important. This time I feel these goals are important because:For Chatline.io we want those goals to be realistic and simpleThat’s it. Just 10 customers in 20 days or one customer every two days. Piece of cake, right?One of the first things I need to discover is which marketing/sales channels work. We don’t have enough time on our hands to do inbound marketing and are limited to a few strategies:Paid is easy to set-up and requires almost no effort. Logged in to Google adwords to set up a campaign and drive some traffic to the landing page. I am hoping to spend less than 100$, if those ads don’t drive valuable signups I will kill it very fast.To test the social channels I registered our I am a big fan of You get instant respect when the Sharks find out you’ve been successfully selling the product the hard way: Door to door, phone call after phone call.It’s astonishing how many excuses entrepreneurs come up with to account for the fact that they haven’t sold anything.I am not making that mistake so I decided it’s time to start hustling. I figured the easy way to get good hit rates is to find companies that are using Slack and have some kind of a live chat component on their website.First I will create/google/scrape a spreadsheet of prospects that match those criteria after which I will try a combination of both emails and phone calls and find out what sticks.I have made the mistake of measuring too much. It’s so easy to track a whole bunch of things and create complex reports. I guess it’s all about measuring the right things.For now I will focus on below questions to measure the success:Am I missing anything here?Answering those three questions is pretty easy with the tools out there. I decided to use a combination of Google Analytics and Mixpanel to come up with the answers.We don’t have too much to work with (low sample size, no traffic on site) but here is what we know now:After three days there is a homepage  signup page conversion rate of 32%.That rate is pretty satisfying giving me a hint that people want to try the product.The next step of the funnel (step 2 after entering slack bot key) looks worrying.1,38% or 6 conversions. What ?!Only 4% of the people that made it to step 1 actually moved on.Or the data is wrong, or the signup process is terrible.So what is signup step1 ? On After trying step 1 again, I can come up with plenty of reasons why there is a sudden drop off at this stage:Unable to copy/paste? Really? Well actually for some reason the input field is disabled on the slack side. On my browser (Chrome) it worked fine, but Sam told me he was unable to copy paste the token on Firefox and had to use “inspect element” (geeks only).I contacted Slack about this and gave some suggestions or ideas on how to make this bot page even better.Clearly we need to work on step 1 to get more people to continue their signup. Sure a lot of people will drop off on step 1, but a 4% rate is just unacceptable.Because of the small sample size and the lack of completed signups, I am unable to answer those questions.The data we have is small to draw big conclusions, but the data already tells me that there is a problem with step 1 in the funnel.This is what the step 1 page looks like and here is what I think is wrong::I just had to fix some of those issues before I started getting more people on the site, so I opened up my editor and came up with these solutions:Here is the result:What do you think?Belgian Technie, passionate about the web  technology.

A startup can be a rewarding but hectic journey. Sometimes it is great and sometimes it is less great. From my own experience and talking to other founders I have learnt a few lessons shared here.Beginning a startup feels like getting onto a treadmill whilst the speed is turned up on you and you just have to learn to run faster and faster. There is a lot to learn and keep up the pace is imperative.Learning to manage all the areas involved in a startup is like learning to juggle lots of balls whilst you are still running on the treadmill and the pace is still increasing.Whilst you are juggling the balls, things happen which are either unforeseen or difficult to predict (and not always positive). This sometimes feels like you also have to learn to dodge rubber chickens which are being thrown in your direction (all whilst running and keeping all the balls in the air still).Books, blogs and podcasts can be great as they can help you to understand your industry. They can help you to learn skills more efficiently than trial and error and to be aware of what impending issues may be.Advisers and mentors are great. Advisers can share their experience and wisdom. They can alert you to specific issues you may face and give you personalised suggestions of how to manage them. Treat them like gold because they can be a gold mine of invaluable information and advice (not to mention pretty good people as well).Working with a co-founder can allow you and to focus your skills where they are best. This means you may be able to speed up the development of your startup. It may mean you there is one less skill you have to master right now.Having a supportive friend, family or partner can make life much easier whilst running a startup. Things will not always go to plan and you will have some days which are better than others. Being able to have someone to turn to on those days can make all the difference.Co-working spaces, meetup groups and networking with other founders are great places to find other people going through similar experiences to you. You can learn many lessons from others and surround yourself with people who you can share your highs and lows with on this journey is especially helpful.Founder of RestAlert using wearable tech for behaviour analytics.

That movement is funded by VCs, who pump rounds of money into promising growth-stage startups in the hope that they become the next Facebook, Uber or Airbnb.

In short: it is impossible for a marketplace, social network or other platforms to access all European countries at the same time.

I love startups. I’ve always found talking to people who pour all their passion and creativity as well as countless hours of hard work into building their vision inspirational. I guess that was the main reason I started attending startup networking events. I thought it would be great to listen to other people’s stories and learn from their successes and mistakes before I decided to take the plunge myself.What surprised me was that many of the comments on the meetup groups were from entrepreneurs looking for team members or co-founders. Surely there was a better way of finding the right people to work with than commenting on an event?I did some research and found companies offering recruitment solutions to startups, but I figured that wouldn’t really help early stage startups lacking the funding to pay for recruitment let alone the salary of their new hire. Co-founder dating was another option, but it seemed awfully focused on just bringing two people together (after all, that’s what dating usually means).The question kept nagging at me and a couple of months later I participated in a Hack Day with my (now-)co-founders. A week before the event took place we’d been asked to complete a form asking us what our ideal role would be. This information was used to put us into well-balanced teams with people complementing our own skills. It suddenly clicked. What if you could do that in real life? We used the Hack Day to explore this idea and managed to win first prize with a very hacky but working prototype of a startup team builder. We realised we might be onto something…As strong believers in the Lean principles, we spent a fair amount of time validating our idea. Was this just something that sounded nice or was there a genuine need we could fulfil here? Almost everyone we spoke to seemed to love the idea. We regularly heard people had been searching for a solution to help them build their startup team. Our landing page where future users could register for early access was generating quite a bit of interest. Some disillusioned entrepreneurs said their startup might not have failed if they’d been able to find the right co-founders. But, of course, there were also more critical notes…That’s one of the great questions people asked us. If you want to build a solution to help startups build their teams, surely you should offer some guidance on what a startup team is. We took up the challenge and started researching. Our starting point was We identified four main areas: Development, Design, Sales  Marketing and Strategy, and created four “archetypes” to go with these: the Techie, the Creative, the Hustler, and the Visionary. Of course, that doesn’t mean we think every startup should have four team members, but these four areas should be covered between everyone who’s on the team.And so we launched I am one of the Founders of Startup Startup, the platform where talent connects to start up awesome startups.

It’s Facebook groups.Over 700 million people use groups monthly(Craigslist has audience, as does Facebook groups. Both work exactly the same way — the most recently posted items on top.

As The New York Times’ I love The Times and its vision, and cherished my four years there. But, there was something missing in my career. I had been in CTO roles at four major media companies, with accomplishments I was proud of. However, I didn’t want my 3 year old son Fitz Raj to know me for only being a successful corporate executive, but for accomplishing something significant for the greater good.So I took a leap: A couple of weeks ago, I However, until I met Vinit and Paul, I hadn’t come across a company with all the right ingredients. The most important thing about a startup, even more important than the idea, is the team that supports it. An idea evolves over time, the product and business pivot as the environment changes, and the technology improves and gets disrupted. But throughout, the people make all the difference between success and failure. Both Vinit and Paul share a dedication to building an outstanding team, which is a large part of why I chose to become invested in the company’s vision.The people also make all the difference when it comes to giving back, and working for the greater good.My grandfather, Dr. Krishna Chandra Pant, was a doctor under British rule in India. As the chief medical officer (i.e. the only doctor) at an institute in Mukteshwar, his job was to only treat the (mostly British) employees of the institute. But he knew no borders when it came to helping the sick and injured. There was no other doctor for more than 50 miles, so he welcomed all patients who came to him and he gave them the same treatment. His British employers didn’t appreciate that, and a drawn out lawsuit ensued. The courts finally ruled in his favor and he prevailed in not only keeping his job, but also in gaining the formal authority to treat all patients equally.He continued his medical practice out of the family home long after his formal retirement. I remember he used to treat poor patients without charging them fees. He would even give them the medicines free of charge.In 2014, the World Economic Forum Making the world a better place is no small feat.

It is a fact of the universe that all startup teams are lopsided. I’ve talked with dozens of startup teams (and worked with half a dozen), and this has been true every time.By lopsided I mean that skills, experience, and, most importantly, Startup teams are biased. A designer-founded company will bias toward design. A coder-founded company will over-emphasize software. A hardware-focused company will under-emphasize software. An engineer-founded company will undervalue marketing. A youth-founded company will bias toward youth. And so on. The startup CEO must always look back to the genesis of her company and the culture that was planted then, because bias begins from there, and it lingers. Bias feeds imbalance.For example, I joined a Kickstarter that raised over $600,000 for a cleverly designed Android consumer device. The initial team was made up of veteran industrial designers, mechanical engineers, and manufacturing experts, some with 20+ years of experience. But, expectations around software were off, with a plan to hire a single Android contractor to ‘bust out an app in 8 weeks’. Thus the project was lopsided. Serious software talent was obviously needed, but more importantly, a broader discussion was required around how to plan for the entire software effort as it related to hardware, manufacturing, and marketing. And so, the plan expanded, and the balance shifted. Fast forward 1.5 years; the product can now be purchased on Amazon.(Consider also this famous, recent example of imbalance: technical expertise outweighing the The hardest job of a startup CEO is not, actually, building the product. It is building the team and the culture. Because emotionally mature, harmonious teams are what provide the environment for the greatest products to emerge.To achieve that, the startup CEO must have the awareness and the humility to understand that her team totters on a fulcrum that constantly dips one way or the other. As she adds marketing expertise, the voice of engineering fades. As she grows the sales team, the voice of design recedes. Always, the fragile voice of the customer threatens to disappear into the background. And what’s hardest of all to hear is the voice of the unknown — the challenge that no one could see (or hear) coming.The startup CEO must work constantly toward rebalancing those scales and grooming that chorus of voices. This is achieved not only through hiring but also through training, delegating, questioning, and, most importantly, communicating. (Advisors are priceless in this regard, too.)But… The reality of this effort is that the team will never achieve 100% balance. Perfect balance means stasis, and stasis is deadly. Her goal must be to orchestrate those swings in a rhythm, not to halt them completely.Take for example a fintech startup I consulted. It was founded by seasoned leaders from finance and behavioral economics, and had a team that was built to their strengths. But engineering comprised only 20% of the small group, and the execution pipeline was narrow to the point of strangulation. The scale was lopsided, and it had to swing back. This meant doubling the product team and making essential product delivery improvements as well. But soon after, the team of economists found themselves with less sway, and as subject matter experts, their voice was critical. And so the cycle of rebalancing had to continue. That ability to shift and evolve helped them land $20 million in series B funding last autumn.A truly great startup CEO comes in many flavors. But a consistent quality is humility (which is The knowledge required to build anything meaningful in the modern world can no longer fit into just one human mind. This is why we build teams. Teams are collections of subjective, biased, sometimes misguided, and often passionate human minds. Just as individual humans are flawed (‘perfectly imperfect’ I would say), so are the teams that they form. The biggest challenge for a startup, then, is not about shipping your amazing widget. Its about nurturing a chorus of flawed and imperfect voices into a crazy kind of harmony whose true output is magic.Product Strategist

For those of you who don’t it’s only the most bad ass place to launch your startup, and show off your startup to a hyper targeted tech audience. This is also a really great way to meet investors, the press and acquire new users. Some notable startups to launch at TC Disrupt are DropBox, Yammer, FitBit, Zenefits, Trello, Postmates, Venmo, Mint plus many others, so don’t worry you’re in good company.Check this video out for a overview of what you could be a part of. Its basically prom for startups lol.We do have some funding, but since we are doing this we will not be able to attend TC Disrupt this year, It was an easy decision. Please send us lots of pictures, or maybe do a Periscope? or Meerkat? whatever the cool guys are using ;)Best of luck!!@koridhandy  @_mitchellporterDesign founder UX design, and Startup ups and downs

Entrepreneurship is a crazy ride. I’ve experienced the highest highs and the lowest lows. And When embarking on a startup journey, know this: your partner has to be just as invested as you are. For me, I didn’t do the normal Silicon Valley thing: I didn’t quit my job and throw myself into it full time. Instead, I took a job below market that only required me to work 40 hours a week. We gave up a lot of nice dinners and nights at the movies. On top of my full-time job I worked another 40–50 hours a week on my startup. So clearly I wasn’t spending a lot of time with her. After getting 18 months deep, I came very close to quitting, right as we were about to succeed. I even applied to go back to school. Then, three weeks before I got accepted, I started making enough money to take the startup full-time. That was such a stressful period, and it could have broken us.When I think back to what it took (and still takes) to succeed, I think But no matter what, the biggest factor is I’m really lucky. Partner at GrowthX and SVG Syndicate. Love learning and helping entrepreneurs. Founded what became Match.com.

It’s everywhere and it’s pervasive within the tech community. Anywhere you look you’ll see; “Five Lessons I Learned From Failing”, “What You Can Learn From Our Series A”, “The Ten Best Books For Entrepreneurs!” or “What One Year Of Entrepreneurship Has Taught Me”. Enough, I get it. The entire “startup” community (and I use quotation marks because I hate the word startup) is like one big exercise in ego stroking, self-indulgence and exclusivity. People who’ve barely gotten their feet wet are already publishing books, blog articles and social media with lessons for us all. Well here’s a little something most people don’t know:Yes, you read that correctly. Having succeeded in previous ventures does not improve your chances of success one bit* — Everyone starts with a clean slate Are people really going to say that? Nope. Way too many people hopped on the entrepreneurial bandwagon and became robotic versions of themselves within weeks of joining “startup” culture. It’s easy to spot these people as they use the terms entrepreneur, startup, tech, code or product about five times per sentence. You get the feeling that they think if they don’t advertise the fact that they are an “entrepreneur” or run a “startup” every few minutes you’re going to forget. Why do they do this? Because like Jason Fried said in his book Rework:Well said Jason. Why wouldn’t people throw around the term once they’re a part of this “exclusive” club? They’ve waited outside in line and now they want to wave their membership card around so you can know exactly how much of an insider they are. Let’s just scrap the term altogether and call people what they really are; a founder and a business owner. Just because you created the next app that lets me decide on the best emoji for any occasion does not make you any more of a businessman/businesswoman than the man that runs the bodega down the street from my house (by the way he’s been in business for over thirty years, how long have you been around?).Let’s get authentic here people. Let’s stop waiving our pristine flag of entrepreneurial awesomeness and bulldoze down the members-only club. I mean seriously is it any wonder that so many people hate us? We’re fucking boring and we sound like robots. Let’s start self-identifying as business owners and business founders. Finally, let’s admit that many of our successes can’t be replicated and write articles about creativity and determination because these are the backbone of what we do.Web developer, traveler, wannabe writer, Medium enthusiast, and dog whisperer (well…kinda, I just sing her made up songs).

I would have never expected that my company would evolve into a technology startup. I’ve always associated that word with an exotic form of conducting business which only appears in American movies.When we created two divisions of your business, and I took the responsibility for a Post launch, we quickly concluded that many of our business challenges were due to the fact that we were simply doing too many things at once. So, we separated a large part of the business and I became the captain at the helm of the ship.I understood that we could no longer expect “free” cash injections from the EU or investors. We had to start working really hard. This however was the very hard part that is often left out of the attention-grabbing plots of American movies. And this is how our journey began.Startups are not like the movies. At the same time, it requires your full dedication and the will power to fight in order to reach your set destination. Did I mention that you are expected to finish every task ASAP?However, the biggest advantage of working in a startup is the pace of learning, and it is impossibly fast. This can be likened to CrossFit — where you have to perform “During my personal experience with CrossFit I have found more and more analogies that lend themselves to the startup world than I could have ever imagined. Startups and CrossFit have a lot in common.Polish investor, The same is said of sport — you are a winner only when you give it all. Only then do you get satisfaction, because you have done everything in your might in order to achieve your goal.CrossFit is a sport created out of components of other disciplines (e.g., weightlifting, metabolic training, rowing and gymnastics). The main rule of CrossFit is to exercise in such a way to prepare you for every circumstance.That is why CrossFit is practiced by many — “police academies and tactical operations teams, military special operations units, champion martial artists, and hundreds of other elite and professional athletes worldwide.”The strength and conditioning regimen of CrossFit works on every aspect of physical fitness: cardio-respiratory endurance, metabolic efficiency, strength, flexibility, power, speed, agility, balance, coordination and accuracy.In the same way, the regimen of launching and scaling a startup conditions every component of your life.Contrary to becoming an employee at a corporation, where you become an expert in a given area (usually according to provided instructions), for startup founders you are tasked to expand your current knowledge and take on much more … with slim to none instruction.In the beginning stages of a startup, there is usually not have enough funds to hire versatile specialists — that is why the leaders and employees must already be skilled in as many areas as possible. It is difficult, but for people who love challenges and want to learn launching a startup is an amazing experience.Like CrossFit, the startup world is not for everyone. Both areas focus on cause and effect. People who exercise possess one common trait: they are willing to push their mind and body to the limits in the face of weariness and seemingly defeat. They constantly strive to find their limits and conquer them. This is the mentality of a high performance — in athleticism and entrepreneurship.During my first CrossFit training I vomited, probably because I’ve made a lot of mistakes. Being a young entrepreneur, my body for many times has reacted similarly. And this is not a hyperbole.When you exercise you need a long-term plan. As an employee, you focus on the right muscles in a place where many situations are repeatable and the outcomes are inevitable. In startups, we discover what works and what does not work — every single day.CrossFit is similar to entrepreneurship in several ways because you:Best of all, when you actively participate in CrossFit you meet people similar to you and can feed off of their motivation and energy. Of course, just like any other activity, too much intensity over a long period can have a negative impact.In the same way, staying at the startup edge for too long is unhealthy for both you and your business. Even though it is a fun and exciting period, the goal of every early-stage startup is to mature, scale and enter a less intense, but more stable mode.In both cases, in order to achieve success you need a love for quick tempo, the ability to motivate yourself, and empathy. The rest is a matter of endurance and consequent work and development of ourselves.CEO

Wir haben es verkackt. LABELit ist tot und es ist unsere Schuld. Und dabei haben wir fast 50.000 Euro verbrannt. Das Geld ist weg. Wenn ich die investierte Zeit und den Verdienstausfall hinzurechne, komme ich wahrscheinlich auf das fünffache. Also lieber nicht dran denken.Bin ich traurig? Ja, sehr. Bereue ich es? Nein, keine Minute und keinen Euro, den ich in LABELit investiert habe. Dieses Unternehmen war das beste, an dem ich jemals gearbeitet habe, mit dem meisten Spaß, den größten Emotionen, der steilsten Lernkurve.Ich bin trotz allem ziemlich stolz auf das, was wir erreicht haben. Fast jeder hat eine große Idee, die er gerne umsetzen möchte, könnte, würde. Konjunktiv. Die allermeisten machen es nicht. Wir haben es gemacht, wir haben viel Zeit und Geld investiert, wir haben ein digitales Produkt entwickelt und auf den Markt gebracht. Und am Ende sind wir gescheitert.Es gibt einige Gründe, warum LABELit keinen Erfolg hatte. Im Nachhinein sind sie ziemlich offensichtlich. Aber wenn man mittendrin steckt, sieht man vieles ganz anders. Und es war nicht alles schlecht. Viele Dinge liefen sehr gut, wir haben einiges richtig gemacht — aber halt nicht genug. Und da die Weltherrschaft durch uns jetzt erstmal verschoben ist, kann ich gleich mal erzählen, was ich gelernt habe in den letzten zwei Jahren. In unregelmäßigen Abständen werde ich hier über Themen wie Produktenwicklung, Team, Design, Finanzierung, Technologie und Marketing schreiben. Aber das ist nur die Oberfläche, denn eigentlich geht es um Blut, Schweiß und Tränen, und das ist besser als jede Daily-Soap.Am 5. Oktober 2011 starb Steve Jobs. Am selben Abend saßen ein guter Freund (wir nennen ihn Endrik, weil es Endrik ist) und ich auf der Schanze in Hamburg in einem Restaurant und er erzählte mir von einer Idee, die er seit seiner Diplomarbeit hat: Was wäre, wenn man alle Dinge, die man im Fernsehen, auf Websites und in Videos sieht, direkt kaufen könnte? Was wäre, wenn an jedem Produkt ein Preisschild hängt? Wenn man den Anzug aus Mad Men kaufen könnte. Das Kleid auf Gala.de. Das T-Shirt aus dem Skate-Video, das man gerade auf YouTube gesehen hat.Ja, das wäre ziemlich cool. Lass machen!Das war die Geburtsstunde von LABELit. Gemeinsam mit Endriks Freund Helgo und dessen Bruder Götz starteten wir LABELit. Die nächsten Monate recherchierten wir: Wettbewerber, Technologien, Mechaniken. Wie kann man Preisschilder an alle Dinge hängen, die man in “den Medien” sieht. Schnell wurde klar, dass wir uns (im ersten Schritt) auf das Web konzentrieren mussten. Der TV- und Kino-Markt war zu abgeschottet. Für das Web könnten wir eine Technologie entwickeln, die unsere Vision in die Realität umsetzen würde.Um auf jeder Website präsent zu sein, brauchten wir ein Tool, das genau dies ermöglicht: Preisschilder (wir nennen sie Labels) an jedes Produkt hängen. Ein Browser-Extension kann das. Wir konzipierten die Browser-Extension. Wir entwickelten die Browser-Extension. Nichts davon gab es irgendwo. Keine Vorlage, kein Blaupause, keine Erfahrungswerte. Wir überlegten, konzipierten, verwarfen, konzipierten neu. Und es funktionierte.Das Problem: wir brauchten — besser: wir wollten, einen Ort, wo wir alles sammeln. Unseren LABELit Hub. Also bauten wir eine Art shoppable Pinterest. Technisch und konzeptionell war das nicht ganz trivial. Hier nur ein paar StichworteDie Liste geht endlos weiter, immer weiter. Jeder Punkt hätte uns als komplettes Team eigentlich mehrere Tage gefordert. Da wir die Zeit nicht hatten, haben wir einfach gemacht. Das funktionierte mal gut, mal nicht so gut.Hier liegt aber auch genau das Problem: Das alte Startup-Motto “Do one thing and do it well” haben wir leider nicht befolgt. Gerade als kleines Team mit begrenzten zeitlichen und finanziellen Mitteln ist es essentiell sich auf eine Sache zu fokussieren. In unserem Fall wäre es z.B. die Browser-Extension gewesen. Obwohl sie massive Limitierungen hatte (mobile!), kam sie unserer Vision, das Internet zu labeln, am nächsten. Und sie war verhältnismäßig einfach umzusetzen. Ein VC gab mir übrigens letztes Jahr genau diesen Tipp. Aber ich ignorierte ihn, wir hingen schon zu tief drin.Das MVP ist das Minimum Viable Product. Die Betonung liegt auf Minimum. Es ist nicht so, dass wir noch nichts vom MVP gehört hatten. Im Gegenteil: Jeden Tag predigte ich, dass wir uns beschränken müssen, weniger ist mehr und so weiter. Das Problem war: wir dachten, alle diese Features sind essentiell. Wir dachten, wir bauen ein Minimum Viable Product. Dabei entwickelten wir ein Maximum Viable Product. Wir wollten von Anfang an alles richtig machen — was letztlich nur dazu führte, dass wir zu viel auf dem Zettel hatten. Christian Reber, der Gründer und CEO von 6Wunderkinder, hat einen spannenden Christian und sein Team hatten eine Vision. Aber sie starteten sehr, sehr klein. Wir hatten eine Vision und starteten gr0ß. Wir wollten alles, sofort. Ich sage nicht, dass es nicht möglich ist. Aber wir vier Gründer machten LABELit nebenbei. Nach unseren “richtigen” Jobs, am Wochenende, abends, wenn wir Urlaub hatten. Zu viert. Der Mangel an Zeit, Geld und Arbeitskraft liegt meist in der Natur einer Startup-Gründung. Diese Ressourcen gilt es zielgerichtet einzusetzen. Und das kann nur funktionieren, wenn man sich fokussiert.Creative Director at Startups  Stories aus Hamburg

However, don’t forget about the metrics that relate to your core business. Just because investors don’t know to ask for them doesn’t mean they aren’t critical to your success.Peter currently leads Hyde Park Angels (HPA) as the managing director.

How does a thought become a thing? Let me explain…A I came into I am one of those people that keeps a running list of things I don’t like; its called the “list of things that suck”. Some have solutions I have thought through, and some are just bitch rants that I hope sound funny.The gears began churning as I thought through the never-ending scribble that leads to I google “effective meetings”.Hmmm, sounds simple enough… what if an app could automate this?Tough one to do with a pen and paper, but with your smartphone, you can simply record the entire discussion.Well good meetings have agendas, so how about we let users select the agenda topic under discussion and organize the recording.People know when something important is said. We’ve all been there when everyone reaches for their pen at the same time. A big button that tags  captures “important moments” can replace the scribbling.Well at this point, sending out notes would be super simple. So why not just email the attendees the notes, each linked to the highlighted soundbites.As the idea crystalized, I realized how much I had the simple idea, now I needed to find an extraordinary team. We had 60 seconds to pitch the concept, I think I took 20. I guess that’s pretty simple…Ayush and Rishav approached me. To prove their chops, they showed me a geo-location based social media app that they built. I was hooked. We had our Front-end and Back-end developer.Julia waited in the background as I explained the concept further to the dev-duo. Soon enough, she jumped in to help with the User Experience. Another front-end developer, Asem, and a self-proclaimed “A fully working voice recorder where you could record and playback meetings by topic. A highlight tag that captures the most important moments for easy reference. A quick note taker that allowed you to annotate the recordings. An automated follow-up that emails notes out to make sure everyone is on the same page.Because thats exactly what it does. It wraps up meetings, and its an app. We make a logo. Again, super It was a dream. They hand us one of those Who cares, we won! We’re going to Silicon Valley!

Here are a couple reflections from a humbling summer (~12 weeks) spent as a Lightspeed Summer Fellow and how my experience as a first-time founder relates to the early lessons of CS183C (Technology-enabled Blitzscaling).On the first day of class in CS183C, Reid Hoffman stated that building a company from the “family (1–10 people)” to “nation (1,000+)” stage requires vastly different skill sets and decision-making processes at each step along the way. Looking back, it took me almost an entire summer to fully appreciate this.When we look at the pop-culture that is Silicon Valley, we’re exposed to mere pieces of the larger puzzle. The founding stories of successful companies such as Slack, Airbnb, Uber are well-documented, but they rarely highlight the intense metamorphosis of the founders’ mindsets along the way.Four months ago, I believed that the same attention to detail, appreciation for design, minimizing of technical debt and perfectly-crafted narrative that makes companies like Slack massively successful So we (When the release inevitably flopped, we decided to change course in exploring a new product in a new market. This time around, we built and released a prototype in just 3 days, borrowing from multiple components of an open-source project, and used an unscalable infrastructure. In fact, we had put the product together so haphazardly that we were slightly embarrassed to show it to our friends. But as Reid Hoffman stated in the first class: “If you’re not embarrassed by your product release, you’re probably going too slow.” We learned more about our users and engagement in the following week than we had the entire 4 weeks prior.At the beginning of the summer, we would build any feature that potential-clients said would be nice-to-haves in the hopes of closing them afterwards. A mid-sized company told us that there would be a good chance they would adopt company-wide given we implemented SAML/SSO. So we did. One heavily-caffeinated weekend later, we delivered the feature only to hear that they had other priorities to attend to and would revisit the project later.There are a dozen other things I can write about — but I wanted to elaborate on the two that I believe to be the most significant. I’ll share further thoughts in a future post.If you would change the world, first change yourself.The general submission collection for CS183C.

Everyone in Berlin is obsessed with location — it’s all about finding the right Kiez, or neighbourhood. Outside the With that in mind, here are some of the best known parts of Berlin, and why they might be the right choice for your startup and budget — and what the best options for those new to the game.The obvious option for young and creative startup teams. It’s diverse, fashionable, has cafes and bars galore, and is home to many of the city’s most established startups.Formerly the liveliest part of West Berlin, Kreuzberg’s melting pot of culture — where some of the city’s wildest U-Bahn stations bring you close to the trendiest coffee shops and edgiest pizza joints — makes it a great place to mix with other startup teams. And perhaps the best place to kick off a Friday night in Berlin!Scattered around Moritzplatz, Schlesisches Tor, Kotti and the Paul-Lincke Ufer, the district is home to the likes of EyeEm, SumUp, Amorelie and ZenMate, which rub shoulders with flat whites and vegan burritos. It’s the place to be, if you can afford it.Though it’s not as rough around the edges these days, Mitte is home to numerous creative agencies (C3, aperto, Scholz  Friends), tech startups (Trademob, Houzz) and company builders (HitFox, Makers).In and around the likes of Hackescher Markt and Rosenthaler Platz, creative professionals cross paths with tourists, and the Torstrasse and Auguststrasse are the hottest spots outside of work hours. Try Kuchi, Shiso Burger or Dudu for lunch and Kaschk or Odessa Bar in the evening. Naturally it comes as no surprise that Mitte’s rental prices are higher than the city average.With St. Oberholz and Soho House among the regular meeting points for startup founders and investors, however, top food and drink joints make Mitte the perfect place to wine, dine and impress.If being able to peer out at the mighty TV tower from your office window is less of a priority than your budget, there are plenty of over options. Neukölln is not somewhere you would have considered setting up your business a few years ago; less than a decade ago, new arrivals to the city were warned off the area. An astonishing transition since then, however as seen it become the home Kiez for many of Berlin’s most creative hipsters, and some of the city’s finest nightlife spots.With cheap rental prices and streets filled with pubs, cafes and vintage shops, startups and co-working spaces are starting to take a serious look at Neukölln. And it’s changing rapidly.It’s got the Agora Collective ‘Denkfabrik’ space for one, as well as They Call It Coworking Neukölln. And countless edgy spaces to both work and play, dotted along the Kiez’s handful of The district at the other end of the U8, which has been dubbed the Berlin metro’s ‘startup line’, is carving itself a similar field for founders on a budget. Another of the city’s traditionally poorer, rougher neighbourhoods, Wedding is on the up.More relaxed than its pricier counterparts, its streets are lined with the new and the old, bohemian galleries alongside original Wedding tenants like printing shops. Pop-up shops and cafes are opening up in reworked spaces, and startup teams are creating offices in warehouses and former retail spaces. Incubator Project Flying Elephant, for example, is housed in a former branch of supermarket Kaisers, and Netzpiloten have opened their Blogger Business Lounge in an old factory hall.Wedding is well connected with great transport links to the city, and along its border with Mitte you will find startup hub Factory, home to the likes of SoundCloud and GoButler. Our top picks are the trendy neighbourhoods of Brunnenviertel, Sprenglerkiez and around Leopoldplatz, in all of which you can find office space for less than Mitte or Kreuzberg.The western half of Berlin, long ignored by the young and creative in the headlong post-Wall rush to the east, is making a comeback, becoming increasingly popular with startuppers. This includes a recent rise in the number of co-working spaces, such as Roof Up and hub:raum. Once home to David Bowie, the Kiez is famous for its open-air markets, wide boulevards and green space, with numerous public festivals and parades taking place all year round.Schöneberg is well-located, only a stone’s throw from Potsdamer Platz, the Ku’damm and Zoologischer Garten. Needless to say, it’s a solid alternative to Berlin’s most popular spots, especially if your clients and partners are based in this part of town. Schöneberg is further proof that you needn’t resign yourself to the high rental prices in other districts.Mitte and Kreuzberg are still the destinations of choice for many of Berlin’s trendiest businesses and hottest startups. Hardly surprising — they are diverse, well-connected, offer a huge range of office spaces for teams of all sizes and are at the heart of the city’s identity.However, there are plenty of just-as-alternative alternatives for those on a smaller budget. Look to an up-and-coming Kiez and there is every possibility of finding a quirky office space that falls into your price range and provides the perfect productive hub for you and your team. So, location-obsessed founders, when you’re looking to rent our commercial property in Berlin, think outside the box — and maybe even outside the Ring!* Office rental prices referenced from the The community-driven voice of startups and technology companies in Berlin.Curated essays from Berlin’s start-up scene.

I was first introduced to start-ups as a career choice during my post-uni One of the things I love about start-ups is that every founder I’ve ever spoken to wants to inspire others to build or join something exciting. They can explain that the dog years pace at early-stage companies means you learn a lot in a very short space of time. The percentage increase in employees, changing aims and customer growth means the company is constantly shifting beneath your feet. There’s always a lot more work than people available to do it so anyone can broaden their skill set. Ideas can come from anywhere in the organisation and quickly be tested.I was completely bought in. I wanted to be part of building something too and working with lots of smart, passionate people.The thing was at first I couldn’t find one start-up I wanted to devote the next year or so of my life to building. I also wasn’t even nearly qualified for most start-up roles (hacking and hipstering weren’t my skill set). Then I came acrossI was helping at As I’ve said Slightly disillusioned, I went to speak to Escape the City founder Rob wondering whether I should walk away. Maybe the role wasn’t right after all etc. Rob told me not to treat it as a no, and that I should show them I’d be capable of what they needed.Hmmm ok. Worth a try.Not totally expecting a reply. The following day I was surprised to receive this back:After a quick phone interview I was left with 3 working days to find these leads and show how I could grow a start-up network before my interview the following week.My initial idea was to go online and pull together a list of growing start-ups from jobs boards — hiring would imply they were scaling — and then call them up one by one to see if I could get them to agree to a phone call with someone who actually worked at Crowdcube.After about 30 minutes of intense googling, I realised why this wouldn’t work:I sat back and looked around the coffee shop I was in near Old Street. I then started looking more closely at the people in the coffee shop. Mostly 20–35 years old, sitting on their laptops, in the middle of the day. Too old to be students but not exactly unemployed. I got up and started approaching people, opening with:I spoke to 5 people and everyone was happy to help. I got 1 Crowdcube-able contact out of that session. (the other 2 were start-ups but one was intl. and Crowdcube was UK only, the other linked to a really well known start-up which didn’t reply to their email).I quickly realised this technique got faster results (or rejections) and started looking for start-up events held the following day. It’s harder to be ignored by people if you’re literally in front of them. Working from this assumption I then:After some more standard interview prep and a short interview at Crowdcube a few days later accompanied by my newly filled little black book I got taken on for the job.I later found out that they’d already decided they would hire me after I sent that first email back saying I’d get the contacts.I’ve been at Crowdcube for a year now and helped a whole host of exciting start-ups raise nearly £7 million between them. Yesterday was my last day there as I’m now moving on to something new — planning to develop my currently non-existent technical skills full time. Eventually I’d like to be building things like all those start-ups I’ve helped fund too.I’m sad to leave behind the start-up that took me on early in my career and have pretty much made sure I can never go back to considering a corporate job.Thanks Learning how to code and product and computer.

QA with Dan Wagner, Founder and CEO of Civis AnalyticsIn 2012, I was the Chief Analytics Officer for Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign, which was kind of a like a big startup…except it was purposefully designed to go out of business.The day after Election Day, Google’s Eric Schmidt approached me, as he was impressed by what our team achieved. We had many of the best data scientists in the world (over 5,000 people applied to join the team, and we accepted only a little over 50). While everyone could have gone to different companies, many of us wanted to stick together, and Eric was able to provide us with the seed funding we needed to keep the team together. Less than six months later, in the spring of 2013, As we built out the business plan and started working with clients, we really wanted to look beyond services. We decided to build a Organizations are increasingly creating and storing large amounts of data, but they often don’t have the tools or the personnel to manage that data and create the right insights to drive optimal decision-making. Their data is often buried in multiple, unconnected systems, there’s too much latency, and the supply of engineers and data scientists is just practically limited. Startups struggle with these problems especially because of their intense time constraints; they just need to move fast.We knew there had to be a better way. The Civis Analytics team of 100 data scientists looked at these challenges, and we spent two years building a single platform — entirely on AWS — that helps organizations really do it all: get their data in one place, make sense of it, create predictions for key outcomes, inform the right actions, and automate all of it. It’s the knowledge and best practices of 100 data scientists built into a single platform.And because it’s built on AWS, it can be scaled to fit teams of any size. We work with the smallest startups to some of the biggest companies in the world. For startups that are already using Amazon Redshift, Civis is typically a great fit.While data science is a “discipline,” in day-to-day life it’s also a process that has very similar steps across organizations.For example, when we started out as consultants, we saw the same thing over and over in predictive modeling engagements: you have to pull all the data from multiple systems into one central database, clean the data, impute for missing values, match disparate person records using record linkage algorithms, run a specific function (or ensemble) to predict some outcome, validate that prediction, score the data set, and then do it over again.That While many organizations have giant on-premise solutions to do this, it’s increasingly impractical for small and medium size organizations, especially startups. If you add some new data source, on-premise solutions will require new hardware installations that might take weeks. Furthermore, a single outage can take down your entire insight process. It’s just not practical.As an alternative, we built the entire platform on AWS. We currently use about 26 different AWS services, but most importantly Amazon Redshift, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon EC2. All client data is stored in dedicated, single-tenant Amazon Redshift clusters, for which we can customize the storage and compute requirements at a moment’s notice.The big value for a startup, or frankly any organization, is that you get an entire analytics stack available right off-the-shelf, and it’s all in AWS. Many of our startup clients already use Amazon Redshift, and we can set up Civis to run directly against their instances quickly and securely.The technology foundation that AWS provides allows Civis Analytics to put powerful, data-driven decision-making into the hands of our customers.Some decision tree algorithms, for example, are very computationally expensive if you’re running them on large data sets. If you were doing this on-premise, it might take you days to complete a single model. On AWS, on the other hand, we can leverage several hundred nodes on Amazon EMR to quickly and easily apply this type of model, then spin those nodes down right after completion. You save time and money.The promise of our I know it’s common to say, but we really care about building a data science user experience that is best in class. I talk to so many startups that have mountains of data, but they haven’t yet figured out a way to work that data into their decision-making. We see empowering this new organization, the “data-driven start-up,” as a key opportunity for our technology and business. We’re especially excited about some of our new extensibility options via the Our partnership with AWS has been critical to make this all happen, and we look forward to bringing data science to more customers, especially startups, every single day.Amazon Web Services Startup Program.

The China stockmarket downturn and currency changes have started to impact the global market. With a global portfolio of 50+ high performing startups in our SparkLabs Global portfolio, many more in the SparkLabs Korea accelerator alumni, and a fast growing startup of my own (Smartup.io), I thought it would be very timely to discuss what is happening in China and it’s potential impact on startups.So I quickly jumped on a call with Adding to that, there is something about the macro economics of China that people have been talking about, that deserves a bit more attention. Whenever we look at the macro-economic data of a country, we look at statistics mostly, sometimes from single sources and sometimes from a whole bunch of sources. But At the moment, China does not feel to me to be as stable as people want it to be, considering how much they are now exposed to it. Added to that is the uncertainty that comes from not knowing whether the measurements of the statistics that we use to understand the state of the economy are themselves accurate or if they can be.One other thought — the fast moving nature of China has made it a desirable place to go. The speed of production, the vast customer base, the ever evolving economy makes you want to be there. However, things that we want out of an investment environment — stability, predictability — those are things that don’t work very well in the China context simply because of all the things I’ve said before. So all told, China does not feel like a place I would feel very comfortable being highly exposed to at this time, unless I was comfortable with a highly heterogeneous set of outcomes.Being prepared for uncertainty is the same for a large organization as it is for a startup. It means having extra resources that aren’t currently being used — that look like inefficiency or waste — that might be useful when the current environment changes. That change could be a macro-economic change, or a new technology for instance. It’s very difficult to plan for though: even if you invest in extra resources to be ready for uncertainty, you can’t guarantee that your extra resources will be appropriate for whatever change occurs.You should not be trying to build that massive product that you hope will be a total market killer, You can prepare for uncertainty not just by stockpiling cash, but also by:All of those things are important to build up in your business, so you aren’t scrambling to do them when change is forcing you to.And if you are thinking about China as a source of demand, then I would consider the possibility that China is not demographically as it is presented — it has been presented in recent years as a rapidly expanding wealthy middle class with strong buying power. But China is a massive country with a much more diverse population that that and you should watch the retail numbers very closely to see if there is a growing impact of the stockmarket and currency changes on the purchasing power of this sector of the Chinese economy.However, let me finish by saying that as individuals, as humans, we tend to think about risk a lot and try to make bets and predict future outcomes. However, as we move into more interdependent economies and rapidly changing environments in which we do business, Frank is the co-founder of SparkLabs Global Ventures, which has over 50 startup investments around the world and is the sister company to SparkLabs Korea: Asia’s largest accelerator.

Often, in the quest for growth and scalability of a business idea, founders (of startups) miss out on researching, forming and implementing key legal documents, which ensure a smooth journey for a startup in the long run. We can quote one too many instances where the absence of a legal framework has created a dent in the business or slowed its pace of growth. A classic example (popularized by the movie The Social Network) is the Winklevoss Twins vs. Facebook case, where Mark Zuckerberg entered into a verbal agreement with the twins to help create HarvardConnection in return for equity, while parallelly setting up TheFacebook.com. Closer to home, we often hear of disagreements between co-founders, because of lack of clear legal documents detailing the agreement between a startups’ founders or even with early-stage employees.Keeping such case studies in mind, in our first blog, we take a peek into the nuances of having a clear legal framework and strategy right from the early days.The first step, quiet obviously, after you decide to startup is to figure out how you want to incorporate your company.As a startup, you can register your company as a private limited company, a sole proprietorship, a limited liability partnership (LLP), or a partnership. The co-founders must collectively decide the type of entity they want to form, keeping in mind the venture’s long-term plans. Right from the incorporation stage, we’d recommend you to work with a lawyer to get the documents in place. Each type of entity has its own advantages and disadvantages — in terms of tax, personal liabilities, future fund raising factors and so on. Even the location where you incorporate your company matters, and expert opinion becomes crucial in all these matters.The second, crucial step lies in creating a comprehensible shareholder agreement with your co-founder or business partner. Today, more than ever, a lot of startups are founded with multiple co-founders on board. And, typically, a conflict between the founders arises when the business is either taking off or is on a downward spiral. In such circumstances, a co-founder agreement will come in handy. It should cover critical aspects such as the common goal of the company, the roles and responsibilities of each founder, the ownership percentage, the salaries that each founder is entitled to, the dilution strategy; who will dilute, when, the extent of dilution and more.The third aspect lies in the protection of core intellectual property. If you have a unique product, technology, platform or process, or if you are outsourcing part of the development to an independent developer or external service provider, it is vital to come to a clear agreement on who owns the code and content. In fact, it is advisable to create an agreement, which states clearly that the ownership lies with the company and not with the service provider you have engaged.The role of intellectual property, especially in technology-oriented businesses, is turning out to be extremely crucial in today’s world. It is important to work with the right IP experts to file copyrights, trademarks and other forms of IP and even plan your future IP strategy. It is also crucial not only to create IP, but also to monetize and protect ones IP rights, and the right legal partner can make a huge difference in all these areas.The world of entrepreneurship has changed remarkably in the last decade or so. Companies are relying a lot more not only on full-time employees but also on part-time talent and even a network of partners. For example, large startups like Ola Cabs operate with a network for drivers, none of whom are full-time employees. Companies like Snapdeal rely on online seller-partners, who’re small businesses.In most of these situations, problems can potentially arise due to disagreements. The role of a watertight contract becomes all the more crucial. We’d strongly recommend having contract with all key relationships your business has — with employees, partners, vendors and clients.While the actual nature of the contract will obviously vary, a good contract will be drafted by thinking through all possible scenarios and corner cases, over the long-term. Often, contracts tend to miss out on timelines. For example, if a client says you cannot work for a competitor, as a startup protecting your own interests, you should add a timeline to it and say you will not work with a competitor for 3 months after the current project ends.With the advent of Internet and digital platforms, to search and identify legal firms/advisors may seem like a breeze. However, it is essential that you work with a firm or individual who understands your business and has prior expertise in the sector you operate in. In fact, the best strategy to identify the right firm or individual is to go through word-of-mouth or referrals. That way, you can avoid a future mismatch between what was committed, what was delivered and what is protected.Startup founders often avoid going to a law firm to save some cash in the early days. However, a better strategy would be to identify a law firm or lawyer through your entrepreneur peers and go with a firm that has a transparent and fair fee structure.While in the early days it is advisable to work on a project-based fee model, and as the startup scales up, one can move into hourly billing or retainer model.At a macro level, the need for legal assistance at any startup must be linked with key business milestones. The milestones can be in the form of revenue generated, the number of customers you have secured, the regions you have expanded into, and more.Over time, as the business expands, you may need to on-board a full-time legal officer and then even setup a full-time team.Till then, do not ignore your legal needs; work with the right law firm to ensure all key legal documents are in place. It can make a critical difference in important junctures — while you’re fund raising, trying to exit your business or even while you ramp up your team.Happy starting up!Altacit Global is a boutique legal firm specialising in Intellectual Property and Corporate Legal Matters.

Truth is, I still believe that as an entrepreneur I did more things right than wrong. However, the end result is a failure. For me, great insights on great entrepreneurs´ experiences lied on their learning process and sharing what they did badly it´s what really matters. Basically, explaining the hard things of hard things. I´ve got to give you the whole context of my personal story, so that your insights of my learning experience be more interesting and the lessons blossom in other entrepreneur´s life.Ever since I entered the best private university in my country (Mexico) in 2012.That being said. My journey as an aspiring engineer begins as foreign student with 60% scholarship, choosing to enter a kickass major such as Chemical Engineering (one of the toughest engineering at my university) which at the time I though it was going to give me the tools I needed for my future company success.However,But there was a magical moment during a Chemical Engineering conference in 2012, at my university, where I saw a student entrepreneur called Parallel to that, my socioeconomic status went slightly difficult and I decided to get a part time job to pay part of my tuition. I had the experience to work in a call center for 4 months, even though it pays the bills, is a damn awful experience I don´t recommend that to anybody. Some good friend advised me to look for jobs inside school and I found a really good one. So, I entered to a That center is one of the best educational certificates for PM professionals in Mexico and Latin America. But that´s where I will find a boss, a mentor, PM guru and future business partner, Phd. I did my job correctly at the center, I sneaked my big nouse in other areas to see what elses I could improve. My relationship with him grew very fast and after I finished my internship, he showed me a software he had developed one year before called. I made some research and found that there was no software in the world that offered something similar. It hit me like a great idea, it made all sense in the world.Adán López gave me “the”shot to manage the project Coordinate and “run” the company together from scratch. No employees. No sales. Just the product with a vision of what it can become.I started on January 2014, at the In the mean time, I was applying all the new entrepreneurship knowledge that I been reading from books like Before entering the summer of 2014, I reach a friend who was studying Computer science, whom I met at the entrepreneurship club, and he was a terrific UX designer, with very creative work. His name is During the summer, I enrolled just one course probability and statistics, with a professor director of the Math department, he is an insanely brilliant man but a homework terrorist. There was another kickstart event my career in that summer of 2014 called After I validated more my skills and desires as an entrepreneur at Startup Weekend. However, I applied something was called in the entrepreneurial world as So, on August 2014, I enrolled Business major A really good and varied team that will carried out the vision of the project. One of the things I most enjoyed with the team, was the weekly meetings in which we discuss requirements from different angles. My teammate We did very good work in terms of analysing every aspect of the functionality, software and design requirements. Then, I convinced UX designer On January 2015, we were determined to build this new thing. We had all this work done and the very optimistic idea that we could change how people create and manage projects in their organizations.Soon enough we got on board So here I was on February 2015, with a a group of professionals programmers that I couldn´t afford but I got them excited to work towards this new Coordinate 2.0. The spirit and motivation of all really kept me going. We launched aWe got to say that in the mean time we developed the product we tried everything in terms of marketing and sales strategies like:At the same time, So, I received an very good opportunity on summer of 2015 thanks to my parents support to live a 4 week startup work experience with Coordinate in Silicon Valley, California.There are many things Silicon Valley can teach you. I learn many stuff from the biggest entrepreneurial hub in the world. It´s ruthless, you have to come up with some great innovation, an atractive product, attractive team, get sufficient traction (sales) or you are not in the game. However, my main objetive was to learn a global startup mindset and transmit that to my team.Regarding Coordinate´s feedback,Today I thanked Jackie that ruthless feedback, entrepreneurs need a good dose of that from time to time. Silicon Valley is an experience that tecnology entrepreneurs should encounter.So,finally, connecting the things that I did badly:It is all or nothing, or you will get mediocre results. You will die slowly in progress and achieve “partial” results. I happened to have a great team that develop a 60% product design and funcionality but I underestimatde my team members´ time and expectations. Something that really killed the animic state was that That thing really, killed us. Assume the market will buy any thing you can produce. Assuming that you know you client fully. Assuming that because from you first product you had 10 paid clients, if you enhance it you will have more. The real thing is that I should tested early and talk with users that didn´t sympathize with me. My learning here is this: I happen to have two skills that allowed me move my team forward. In the last month of Coordinate,we iterate and found an unattended market with Project Portafolio Manager with companies that manage 100+ projects and don´t have a good looking software that simplifies their management., and I built a prototype that allowed me to get 5 promise of trial for December 2015 from big companies. The team was stand by, I got serious talks with 2 investors which didn´t backed me on time, we where going to use Coordinate 2.0 code, because the logic was almost the same.However, the reality is that the I gotta thank my family, friends, university peers, and anyone who gave a “ You can do it” as well for the misleading “ That product is awesome”Mexican entrepreneur in a mission to change himself and the world.

Working for a great company gave me the freedom to learn and explore. It transformed me from a person using Nokia in to an Apple gadget guy all of a sudden. Those treats, trips and fests during my tenure with the company were a bonus and it was fun working there.Though my job was very comfortable and flexible all the while, I felt like something was always missing and at some point of time I slowly started feeling that I would never be able to chase my dreams if I stay stuck with this comfortable life. I thrived to take some risk and wanted to have a breakthrough from this routine.I had the same urge as you, to be part of a startup realm, but it had gradually increased after I travelled (for UX training at After that, I really wanted to work on interesting new products with an inspiring team. I hoped to be part of a Start-up or have one in Silicon Valley someday, and set up one of the greatest companies in the world; but, I was just waiting for the right moment to come.This New Year-2015. I really wanted this year to be challenging and my heart wished the same.I came across few companions who had the same vision as I did, and we shared our passion to bring something extraordinary into this world. You may come across this flash, where your heart and mind tells you, ‘Yes, This is it!’, and for me this was that moment.I felt really connected with the The next morning, I was thinking about how to convey my resignation to the company. There was a moment of silence — slowly, the faces of all the people in my life; my parents, friends, collegues, started to flash in front of my eyes on a rate of 60fps.I had a belief in my heart, that wherever I would go, the world that I know around me, will always support me and stand by my side, just the way it’s been standing with me till now.I wanted to come out of that comfort zone soon, composed my resignation from my desk and hit the send button. I’m no more an employee at the Multinational Company.Felt the emptiness; closed my eyes while the lift was going down. That was the time where you had lost everything you had, but you gain the belief that you can do something great.Finally I had walked out of my comfort zone and didn’t even look back at the company logo which was on the wall, colourful as always; I rolled my sleeves, gave a throttle calmly in my Duke (Da Vinci’s its name), felt the silence and the warm air inside my helmet; kick started to push my limits and leaving the fear behind.I am Design Director • ZargetSoftware company currently on stealth mode…

This is a unique time in the world economy. Technology companies of San Francisco, Bangalore and Tel Aviv, which operated in small garages and apartments, are now becoming multi-billion dollar giants.While I was attending the last term in my business school in the start of 2015, I recognized the uniqueness of the time that I was graduating in. Although I didn’t have the appetite or idea to start something on my own, I recognized that working for a startup was the next best thing to do. A startup provides a platform for accelerated learning and exposes one to various kinds of problems which an organization sees as it grows.As I spent time making this decision for myself, I realized that the parameters that you should use to pick a startup are identical to the parameters that a Venture Capitalist(VC) uses while making an investment in any startup.Following are a few things that one should be mindful of while picking the right company:This is the single most important criteria. A competent set of founders will not only ensure that you are in the winning team, they will also ensure that you are learning deeper and faster than what you would have in a conventional company. A good founding team will push you and bring out the best in you while keeping things bearable. A bad founding team on the other hand will push their agenda down your throat and severely limit the quantity and quality of your learning.Additionally, one should also look at people heading crucial divisions. For example somebody aspiring for a product management role should be concerned about the quality of people in technology and design teams. While handling problems, the sophistication of solution depends on the competence of all stakeholders. A good team will help you push the envelope and learn better.So how do we find out all of this? Here are a few things one should do:1. Talk in length with the founders or the senior management team about the company and your role.2. Seek an opportunity to talk to functional heads who you might be working with.3. Scour the internet and read up about the company, its investors, the culture, the founders etc4. Stalk the company on LinkedIn and identify the kind of talent that is currently working there.5. Talk to investors if need be.Today’s start-ups are solving problems ranging from interplanetary travel to providing day care for your pet. When there is such wide assortment of problems being solved, it’s important to pick a problem which one feels strongly about otherwise you are bound to get disillusioned and look for exits from day 1.There are a lot of jargons thrown around as prefixes to startups. For example, you might hear of a company which is an “Some of the commonly used prefixes are: Internet, Technology, Social, Food-tech, Clean-tech, Ecommerce, Hyper-local, App only, Mobile only, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT)etc. Do read up about these before you start evaluating startups.Being a member of a startup team in itself is thrilling. However what you do within the startup influences your experience and learning greatly. Before narrowing down on a startup job, evaluate whether that particular jobs is going to give you the kind of learning that you are hoping to get out of your startup job stint.Being a reserve player of a world cup winning team is good. But its not the same as being part of the playing 11.We are seeing an unprecedented rise of All companies seeing a fast growth, in different stages of growth, can be identified as a startup. A good proxy for identifying the stage of this organizational lifecycle is looking at the last round of funding that the company has raised:The startup jobs that we encounter today are from companies across these 5 sections of startups. At each of these stages the companies are dealing with different kinds of problems. One ends up developing different kinds of skills in these. The skills that one acquires may not be easily transferable across startups in different stages.Compensation is surely an important aspect of any job related decision. For startups, ESOP(Employee Stock Ownership Plan) make this decision even more challenging as it requires you to take a personal bet on the company’s success. Do not shy away from negotiating favorable compensation as startups are more open and flexible than established firms about such a negotiation.It is tempting to use compensation as the tiebreaker while evaluating multiple job opportunities. One needs to be extra careful with this temptation while comparing startup opportunities. Its often a trade-off between compensation and learning.All these factors will help one take a better decision about choosing the right startup. I would love to hear from you if you think there are other factors which are important in picking the right startup job.

Startups are fucking stressful. You don’t need me to tell you that. It’s quite possible you’ve arrived at this article with that insistent ball of anxiety coiled up in your chest. You need some relief and not in that later kind of way. You need relief Anybody tried those before? Say thanks, and accept your shitty situation. How’s your stress level? Better? Nope, didn’t work for me either. Let’s see what else we can find. Maybe there’s some other good stuff on Medium! Now we’re cookin’! Had a nap and a grilled cheese yet? Feel better? I don’t think so.Stress is tricky. You can have a million conversations, read a ton of articles and it won’t go away. The same problems are there, and now you’re stressed about how bad you are at stress management. That’s how I always felt, until my friend gave me the single best stress management tip on earth.I was a high level employee at an early stage company and things were going Every day was a struggle. That’s when I turned to my friend “I just don’t know what to do.” I said.He carefully listened through the tiny Gchat window I was using to reach for help. “Paul did this,” I explained. “So confusing,” I confessed. He listened carefully as I waited for the same advice I usually get on this sort of thing — don’t worry, relax, this too shall pass, have you tried X,Y,Z or a nap? The usual advice never came. Instead, like a crack of lightning, Ryan gave me the secret:“Put on your headphones…turn them up…and watch this.”Ryan never seems to have the same advice as everyone else. I guess that’s why I was talking to him. “Ok, I’ll give it a shot,” I thought.I watched closely as a lawnmower glided across the grass, a semi-transparent gorilla in the foreground gazed longingly into the distance. Then, like an angel ascending to heaven, the lawnmower slowly lifted into the air as the sweet sounds of The Tallis Scholars filled my ears.I laughed. I felt better. Relief.I keep the video to my browser shortcuts now. When I can’t handle the stress, I put it on. Works every time. Give it a shot.CEO at Cut  Fold. 

4 years ago I was living in San Francisco when This happened to be the same week I started my new startup A few months later she decided to partner with a friend and start a new marketing agency On top of that, we figured we wanted to be closer to family so we started work on a small summer home near our family back home in Canada.In the middle of all this I The following 9 months were hectic… but on August 17th, we had a beautiful little boy named Max (or as I like to call him: Mighty Max).2 months later Renee got pregnant again!That’s when we decided to build our dream home on a beautiful piece of land we had bought.Exactly 8 months later we came back from the hospital with our 2nd boy Noah to move into our new home.(So essentially, in a 2 year period we started 2 companies, built 2 houses and had 2 kids.To say that those 2 years were crazy would be a HUGE understatement.The challenge for me is I wanted to be a great entrepreneur AND a great father.It was definitely during this period that I grew the most as a person.I studied books on parenting, spent time talking with experts on all aspects of “balance” and started to create a framework to manage it all.In this video I cover the 5 areas that really provided the most value to achieving this:1) If you have any other tips or tricks, be sure to leave a comment with your feedback… I would love to hear from you. I can always improve my game.Have an amazing day!Family first! CEO / Founder of Clarity 

You’ve probably heard of Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook beginnings and Steve Jobs’ Apple journey and countless anecdotes from other great tech entrepreneurs. However, these Cinderella stories are one in a thousand or even a million. The rest isn’t so glamorous. 99% of all entrepreneurs, at some point, will realize that their idea or product isn’t going to work out and either move on to start a new project or luckily (very luckily), have a fortunate exit to sell their company. These are the stories you’ve probably seldom heard of. This is what being an entrepreneur is all about. Entrepreneurs all know the odds, but they still do what they do because of that simple satisfaction of seeing their product or idea make an impact on peoples’ lives. That passion is what drove me to build my own startup in college. This is the story behind it.Coming to UC Berkeley as an undergraduate freshman in 11, I’ve always wanted to have the experience of building my own startup here, not really a company per se, but just something fun and cool that would solve a problem I was facing and shorten the distance between people. I don’t know, maybe it was because Berkeley was so close to Silicon Valley that I felt like it was almost a movement that I had to be a part of. As I end my final weeks of my undergraduate years and begin working on a new project, I want to share my startup story here at Berkeley, how it was started, what it was like, and essentially the lessons learned from this experience. People often ask me, “Was it worth it even though it didn’t work out like you would’ve wanted to in the end?” Hell yes. Every minute of it.Ever since the first dot com boom, Silicon Valley had emerged into a hub for tech startups, innovative projects, and of course, thousands of hungry entrepreneurs who believed their idea was the “next big thing.” Today, thanks to the dawning of the new digital age (with the popularization of software and Internet), the phrase “starting a company from my dorm room or garage” is more than appropriate and common. Essentially anyone with a laptop and Internet connection can crank out a website or app in no time and start a business. Berkeley, being so close to San Francisco and Silicon Valley, is also filled with this entrepreneurship culture. Almost on a daily basis, I hear news about “this new idea” and “that new startup” created from our own students. It is the new gold rush that everyone wants to be a part of, I mean, everyone. I was fascinated by startups, the whole idea of small teams working on something fascinating without much bureaucratic constraints, and I was eager to join one as soon as I got to Berkeley.Like Facebook’s “Write Something” wall, that emphasizes on celebrating creative and random ideas from our daily lives, I got my idea when I was applying to become an intern at a startup. Back then, even today, the general way of applying to jobs was sending either a pdf or doc file of your resume. Your resume would usually contain a one-page summary of the experiences you’ve done in the past, your skill sets, education and contact information. However, these content cannot be updated. As soon as you send out your resume, there is essentially no way to make anymore changes. Of course you can attach your LinkedIn to show a more updated profile; however, due to different privacy settings between individuals, this is generally not a preferred method. In addition, everyone’s resume template is different, making it harder for employers to accurately search and find their ideal candidate through these scattered formats (using software to filter out keywords often resulted in bad quality screening.)These were the two problems, a lack of template unification and content update. I wanted to create a website to solve this, not a social platform like LinkedIn that focuses on connections, but something more personal to replace the resume application process, a direct and easy-to-use platform between the applicant and his or her perspective company. I had a rough picture on what the site was going to look like and I began working on it. So, starting from a general idea of shortening the distance between people, I began solving the professional aspect of it.Having the basic outline set and very rudimentary designs finished, I began to talk to people about this idea. It was during this time that I met Jeff Zhan (a friend from a campus club), whom I eventually co-founded Clover ink with. At this point, we hadn’t really thought about the business model or sustainability of our project. We were solely focused on building something for fun, something simple and effective that we would use ourselves. We had a lot fun and we were extremely passionate about our idea, what changes it could potentially bring and how it could impact the world. Even though we were still both college students at that time, classes really lost interest for us and we would just work on our project constantly. Everyday, we would talk about new designs, additional features, and continuously ask our friends about how this idea could be improved. Eventually, we finished. After a month of beta-testing, we finally launched the site in Berkeley. It was August 29, 2013. A day I would always remember. It was just a surreal feeling, to create something meaningful and to share it with everyone.So we successfully launched. But now, the question is, what’s next? What should we focus on after this? Since this was our first time founding a startup, neither of us had any experience in building an actual business. Without a solid business model, we launched at two more UC’s and it was during this time, we began receiving some investor interests. In the end, we figured we didn’t really need the money (since our only cost other than our time was the domain host fee for about $100) and just decided to move on with our own. What we didn’t know at the time was that the growth of most businesses nowadays isn’t organic. To build a business, it’s not just about covering the minimal cost, it’s also about utilizing capital and connections effectively to not only expand, but grow. That was when reality hit us.We weren’t an actual business, simply just a website that provided a service. For the next year or so, other than maintaining our site functionally so our users could continue to use it, we joined a Berkeley incubator called Free Ventures, formed a team and began thinking about business models and future directions for Clover ink. During our time at Free Ventures, we had the opportunity to not only regather ourselves, but also, to talk to entrepreneurs who had done it in the past and learn from their experiences. We came up with some pretty creative and innovative projects. Centering around our original idea to improve connections between professionals seamlessly, we expanded to broader and new concepts such as personal and economical connections. We added new features such as video introductions and personalized Clover ink cards (a prototype that will hopefully replace not just paper resumes in general, but eventually, everything in your wallet). We had a more solid business model and began looking for investors once again.Even though things were looking to get better and we did spark investor and corporate interest, due to a variety of factors (graduating, job recruiting, increased competitors…etc), we decided that it was simply time to move on. It was hard for us to let this go because there were still numerous ideas and possibilities that we hadn’t ventured in. Our goal when we first started this project was to forever change the job recruiting process. Along the way, our goal became more clear and applications with our idea broadened. In the end, we tried, but came up short. Nevertheless, it was a great run and we definitely learned a great deal throughout the process, experiences and lessons that we couldn’t have learned from our classroom textbooks. It was a great journey and in the end, we had no regrets.As I finish up my classes, one key takeaway from all this, I guess, is that, “Don’t try and avoid mistakes and don’t be afraid to fail. Learn from your faults and move forward and often times, when you look back in retrospect, a deviated path might lead to a greater success in the end so never be discouraged from failing. Always keep moving.” Building Clover ink had been the most rewarding experience of my life thus far and even though in the end, we had to let this go, we had no regrets. That’s the end of Clover ink and the start of a new chapter. If you have been thinking about starting a project for a while now, stop thinking and start doing. If you never take the first step, you will never know what’s going to happen next. Just do it. It will be well worth it.*Special thanks to everyone who has been on the Clover ink team throughout the years- Andrew, Bianca, Jaydee, Alison, Yolanta, Emily, Selina, Harsh, Steven, Sonny, and Ji-Hern.

Don’t build anything until you have a clear startup missionEvery startup is building a product, but not every startup has a clear mission.In this post I will explain how we defined our mission by focusing on our story.Here is the story of 3 years ago, my partner and I co-founded We bootstrapped the company from 0 to 200K customers and 11 employees.Growing a business sound like a simple process:However implementing this process was a difficult task.We decided to build an analytic tool, that will help both us and other startups grow. We named it When building or planning a new startup we usually think about The answer to Let me give you an example: According His mission was not to make iPhones or iPads or Macbooks.You can definitely tell that Apple are achieving this goal over and over again.Your mission should be inscribed deep in your company’s DNA.The next question we asked ourselves was:We decided that building a great tool is not enough,To achieve our mission, not only we will build the best analytics tool for startups, but we will also build a community that will share with each other how to use our tool to grow their business.The world’s fastest car is useless unless you know how to drive.Most of the marketing techniques I’ve used were a direct result of learning from other people’s experience.Google Analytics is a very powerful tool, but it always felt too complicated, and just “not for me”.Since we want to help startups grow, rather then just charge them for a tool they don’t know how to use, we need to build a community of Growth Hackers around the product.This community will inspire its members to learn from each other and share how they use our tools to achieve success.When your mission is bigger than “build features A, B and C,” you can see the big picture, understand what is the value you are providing to your users, and what you need to do in order to deliver it.5 Years from now the world will change, feature “X” will not be good enough, we will probably need to build feature “Y”.When planning When developing solutions for eBay sellers at 3Dsellers(a company we founded in 2012),When someone visits our website we want him to feel he came to the right place,For instance, when users asked for a shipping automation tool, theoretically we could have built it, but it would not have fit our mission.Unfortunately, many startups devolve into a list of features, without a clear understanding of This blog is part of our effort to show you how we manage our startup, how much money we make, how many users we have, which marketing techniques we try, and basically how we grow CEO @ Kilometer.IO ,

Around Halloween, six weeks into the This may seem counterintuitive.But, building teams from scratch is counterintuitive.At Each It’s not like speed dating.It’s not like marriage.It’s a step by step process of experimentation and evaluation.And we have found that six weeks into the programme (end of October), the teams need to be broken up and start again.For us, there are three simple stages to building a team.First, find someone who wants to work on the same problem or technology as you.Second, start working together immediately, as if you were co-founders.Third, We believe that if you’re going to fail with someone, you need to find that our The status quo is that you get potential co-founders together and you then try to keep them together. At Team break-ups happen continuously throughout the first three months of the programme, but there seems to be a significant number after six weeks.This happens because it takes a while to understand what kind of co-founder you need. Many individuals join The ‘Halloween Massacre’ is a key part of the Strong teams that build good startups are productive from day 1; productivity is traction for teams. They don’t get lost in thinking and strategising, they treat every day like a time-limited hackathon and they get shit done.The Halloween Massacre is about first identifying the teams that aren’t productive and then helping them to make a decision about whether they should break up or not. If they choose to stay together they will have to meet tight deadlines to prove that they can be productive.It’s worth remembering, productivity is traction for teams. If teams can’t be productive this from day 1, they won’t magically be able to on day 100. And at EF when you’re surrounded by 99 other potential co-founders, there’s an opportunity cost to staying with the wrong one.We push the EF teams to make decisions quickly about their co-founding relationships.

Here’s a dirty secret: Singapore is really good at getting people to drink its kool-aid. As a tourist destination, it’s great at trumpeting itself to the press. The local media has made an art out of proclaiming that Singapore is number one, or near the top, in everything.It’s a top financial center. The most competitive economy with the lowest unemployment rate. The list goes on. But here’s the problem: people believe the Singapore hype too much. The more times you repeat a lie, the higher the tendency for you to believe it. Fortunately, that bubble has burst in recent weeks.Two startups announced massive funding rounds. Neither are from Singapore. One prominent startup has downsized in Singapore. Thailand’s aCommerce These developments have the following effects:It’s the second effect that could have lasting impact on Singapore’s reputation as a startup hub. It exposes the country’s weaknesses:Given these factors, it’s very easy to discount Singapore as an overhyped startup hub. If we’re talking lifestyle, there’s beautiful Bali, which offers tranquility together with Think what you will about Singapore, but you can’t blame its government for hyping up the country. It’s a necessary survival strategy, woven into the circumstances which birthed forth the nation. And it remains important today, given the odd environment it is situated in.Depending on your viewpoint, you’d believe one of two things: either Singapore’s meritocratic ideology was at odds with Malaysia’s racial politics, resulting in an ouster that caused Lee Kuan Yew to famously weep on TV, or Singapore overplayed its hand by meddling too much in Malaysian politics and got shown to the door.The consequences, however, were undisputed. Singapore had to fend for itself without a hinterland. Its entire narrative, politics, and economic policy, up to today, revolve around that very fact. It’s forever a startup headed by a nimble, near opposition-less government that can react swiftly to changes.As such, Singapore is very sensitive to how it is perceived internationally, especially when it affects the economy. It has to. With no domestic market to speak of, it has to rely on foreign investments to bring in the bacon.Singapore’s governance, infrastructure, intellectual capital, and reputation are its competitive advantages. Lose them and market forces will rapidly swing the other way. In other words, if the government didn’t get the startup ball rolling, Singapore may never take the lead.This is reflected in the startup scene here: it has made a The government demonstrates a lot of self-awareness with these programs. It’s the only government in Southeast Asia capable of enacting, implementing, and iterating upon policy at such a scale and speed, and it’s taking full advantage of that ability. It’s also aware that its research and educational institutions are the best in the region, hence its tweaking of TIS to cater to intellectual property-heavy startups.Critics who point out that Singapore’s government is meddling too much in the startup scene are simply ignorant about the country’s history.There’s a hidden element of Singapore’s startup strategy that hasn’t been articulated much. On the surface, Singapore is marketing itself as an oasis. Its relatively corruption-free governance attracts investors into the region, creating the wide availability of venture capital funding you now see.But what Singapore is, or is trying to be, is an aircraft carrier. It’s projecting influence beyond its tiny shores. It’s trying to achieve what Israel now has, but the reverse way. Instead of collecting a global diaspora, it’s letting people go out hoping they’ll maintain ties here, and bringing people in hoping they’ll develop roots in the country. The influx of talent adds to the local knowledge pool, creating a virtuous cycle of wealth and knowhow.ACE, a Singapore entrepreneurial organization, has set up a Beijing chapter and is looking to This is a full-on, multi-agency, customer acquisition effort to turn Singapore into a brand name for innovative companies and entrepreneurs, both local and foreign. Singapore is not just a destination or a country. It is a signpost for the region and a platform for global expansion.Now we turn to the startups themselves. There has been some nice stories that have come out of Singapore. We have brave Singaporeans who have succeeded abroad: names like Sim Wong Hoo (Creative), Min-Liang Tan (Razer), and Peng T. Ong (Interwoven) comes to mind.We have the hot internet companies that have or are making a name for themselves, many of which are run by foreigners or naturalized citizens: Garena, Reebonz, RedMart, PropertyGuru, Viki, and Luxola are some examples belonging in this category.But for Singapore to really reach its aims, what it needs more of are startups that use Singapore as a base but are global in nature. It needs companies wise enough to get the government or government-linked enterprises as customers, then scale from there. In other words, less So before it gets there, expect to see Singapore market the heck out of itself.

As a life choice, startups seem Some cultures are very familiar with startups, and are more open-minded about them. Bonjack pointed us to Although starting a company was normal among Walter Chen’s friends, it was a surprising choice to his parents. They had already been surprised when he chose to become a lawyer in college; then they were surprised again when Chen transitioned to startups.“The thing is,” Chen goes on, “Asian-American parents are often conservative and status-conscious, but at the same time, they’re immigrants and entrepreneurs themselves. They came to the US for opportunity and to make a better life. So although my parents weren’t happy that I was giving up financial success by leaving the law, they also respected that entrepreneurial spirit. They got excited! In the short term they weren’t excited but in the long term they’ve been very supportive, and now they’re getting annoying and giving me advice that they have no idea what they’re talking about.”As Chen’s example shows, these cultural differences sometimes come from a particular immigrant background. On the other hand, sometimes they come from a family’s investment in big American companies. Because the startup choice is so natural for some people and so surprising for others, it can be very revealing. It’s not just revealing for the startup person — it’s also revealing for the differences in their values between them and their loved ones.“I remember my girlfriend’s first reaction,” he continues. “She was like, ‘you’re gonna take I don’t view careers are linearly progressing, and sometimes ‘backwards’ progress realizes major leaps forward. So when my girlfriend said, ‘You’ve worked so hard to get where you are,’ I explained to her that my goal is to do interesting things with interesting people.”On the other hand, Rosengarten’s family was both unsurprised and excited. “My grandfather offered to help with our IP work on patents,” says Rosengarten. “And my dad was like: ‘Sounds like fun, I’m surprised you’ve been at Yahoo this long. I’m also surprised that you’re going to another company where you’ll have a boss.’ My dad told me that independence runs in our genes and it’s very difficult for us to follow the path of least resistance. While he probably was worried about his eldest son leaving a good job, he knew how I was wired… I was cut from the same cloth as him.”Share what youre reading for work.

Podcasts sind die beste Erfindung der Welt. Nur selbstfahrende Autos sind noch cooler. Und vielleicht die zivile Raumfahrt. Und Wasser mit Kohlensäure.Ich ziehe mein gesamtes Wissen aus Podcasts. Gibt es keinen Podcast zu einem Thema, weiß ich nichts darüber. “Aber Nick, es gibt doch Bücher!” Netter Versuch. Ich habe zwei kleine Kinder, für mich gibt es keine Bücher mehr.

Paul Graham (Y-Combinator), Aaron Levie (Box.com), Ben Horowitz (Andreessen Horowitz), Reid Hoffmann (Linkedin) oder Peter Thiel (Weltherrschaft). Die meisten Vorträge sind nicht nur interessant, sondern amüsant. Dabei wird chronologisch die gesamte Entwicklung eines Startups behandelt: Von der Produktentwicklung über das Fundraising, hin zu Growth  Marketing sowie Team, Kultur und Management. Alles dabei.Der unterhaltsamste Vortrag ist meiner Meinung der von Aaron Levie, geht ja auch schon super los.Also, anhören (Audio reicht übrigens voll aus)!Bei Monocle geht es nicht primär um Tech-Startups. Vielmehr porträtiert die wöchentliche Show unterschiedlichste Unternehmen auf der ganzen Welt. Die Leute von Monocle wissen, wie man gutes Radio macht, die gesamte Show ist hervorragend produziert und bietet spannende Inspiration abseits der allseits bekannten Technik-Blase.Foundation ist das Projekt von Kevin Rose, Gründer von Digg, Angel Investor, ehmaliger VC bei Google Venture und Unternehmer. Rose interviewt bekannte Gründer, z.B. Elon Musk, Ev Williams (Twitter, Medium), Phil Lebin (Evernot) oder Anthony Casalena (Squarespace). Es geht um die Anfänge, um Startschwierigkeiten, um Erfolge und Misserfolge. Mein Highlight ist das Gespräch mit Biz Stone (Twitter, Jelly), der ziemlich lustige Anekdoten aus seiner Zeit vor Twitter erzählt.Bei Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) geht es um die ganz großen Themen: Datensicherheit, die technologische Entwicklung in Myanmar, die nächste Phase im 3D-Druck, Cryptocurrencies. a16z ist die derzeit wohl angesagteste VC-Bude. Marc Andreessen hat Ende der Neunziger mit Netscape den Webbrowser erfunden und gemeinsam mit Ben Horowitz mehrere Firmen gegründet, geführt und verkauft. So verwundert es auch nicht, dass dieser Podcast eher auf einer Meta-Ebene über dem operativen Klein-Klein schwebt. VCs halt. Trotzdem sehr zu empfehlen, z.B. die Folge über Myanmar.Und jetzt: Operative Tipps von Gründern. Wie geht was und warum funktioniert es? 500 Startups ist neben Y-Combinator der bekannteste Inkubator. Im gleichnamigen Podcasts erzählen Gründer von ihren Erfahrungen, die Tipps sind sehr praxisorientiert, zudem sind die Unternehmen oft noch recht jung. Wer also nach “Hands-on” Tipps sucht, wird hier fündig.Der spannendste, beste, unterhaltsamste Business-Podcast. Alex Blumberg dokumentiert in seinem Podcast wie er ein Unternehmen startet, das Podcasts produziert. Selten wurde ehrlicher und offener über die Unternehmensgründung gesprochen. Absolute Empfehlung.The Verge hat mit Ex-Reddit CEO und Y-Combinator Partner Alexis Ohanian ein Video-Format aus der Taufe gehoben, das gut produziert ist und Spaß macht. Ohanian reist dabei durch die USA und besucht interessante Startups. Sehr kurzweilige Unterhaltung und eine gute Alternative, wenn im Fernsehen mal wieder nur “Wer wird Millionär?” läuft.Tim Ferriss schreibt Bücher, die sich wie Spam-Mails anhören, z.B. “The 4-hour Workweek”. Mit seinem Podcast verfolgt er ein Ziel: “Deconstructing world-class performers”. Und obwohl es nicht nur um Startups geht, bietet die Tim Ferris Show einige sehr unerwartete Insights für Gründer von spannenden Gesprächspartnern wie z.B. Arnold Schwarzenegger.Jason Calacanis hält mit seiner Meinung zu Themen wie staatlicher Regulierung und Einmischung nicht gerade hinterm Berg — aber da ist er im Silicon Valley ja nicht der einzige. Auf der anderen Seite hat Calacanis regelmäßig sehr hochkarätige Gäste vor dem Mikro und kann ein Gespräch führen. Das macht This Week in Startups zu einer verlässlichen Quelle für starke Insights aus dem Epizentrum der Gründer.Es geht nicht um Startups, nicht um Gründen, es geht nicht mal um etwas geschäftliches. Trotzdem ist Serial der beste Podcast aller Zeiten. Serial funktioniert dabei wie jede gute Serie (Breaking Bad, House of Card, Homeland oder was auch immer einen fesselt): wenn du einmal angefangen hast, musst du sofort die nächste Folge sehen. Ehrlich, bester Podcast. Ever, ever.Und das war’s. Die besten Podcasts für Gründer. Ich freue mich über weitere Vorschläge und Tipps.Creative Director at Startups  Stories aus Hamburg

I attended my first Startup Weekend in 2012. I fell in love. It was raw and exciting, and the energy coursing through the building was electric. While there I met two guys, Jimmy Odom and Kirk Lashley who were working on an idea called Ratingskick in a hallway covered in pizza boxes. For the life of me, I couldn’t understand what their company was actually supposed to do, but I loved the passion that these guys had. It was contagious. They ended up winning the “Most Innovative Company” award.After the weekend, Kirk and Jimmy (who had just met eachother at the event) decided to try to bring RatingsKick to life. It didn’t work out, but a few months later, while Kirk was on vacation, Jimmy attended another Startup Weekend with a new idea for a delivery service. This time Jimmy met Daniella Bolzmann. The two of them would work on a company pitch and ultimately they won the competition.After winning, Jimmy, Kirk and Daniella decided to make the company a reality. They called it WeDeliver. They built a product, raised a seed round, hired a team, processed millions of dollars of transactions and two years later were accepted to join the Chicago Techstars class of 2014. On top of a great company, the three of them created life long friendships out of random couple of weekends. That’s the magic of Startup Weekend.Earlier this week Techstars announced that it had acquired UP Global, the parent company of Startup Weekend. This is a big win for Techstars and an even bigger win for the global startup ecosystem.In acquiring Up Global and their 1000 global startup events per year, Techstars Techstars is helping to facilitate serendipity, or as David Cohen likes to say helping people become more “Co-founder of

It’s no secret Los Angeles’ tech boom is spreading through the city like wild fire. While San Francisco and the Bay Area fill to the brim with startups that drive up office space and living costs, tech companies are choosing Los Angeles for more options, a wealth of tech talent, exposure and access to the entertainment community.One look at This isn’t only about money going out, but money coming in. Being downtown means you’re closer to the banking sectors. Making connections and raising funds won’t be too far out of reach.With finance, manufacturing, professional services, architecture and construction, and fashion companies around every corner you’re at the doorstep to every business currently being disrupted by technology. You have more opportunity to be that person disrupting their field and solving the problems they face daily. Because DTLA is so condensed, it’s easier to create these communities not only within tech, but outside it as well.This extends to the proximity you will be to town hall. Downtown Center Business Improvement District and the Innovation Delivery Team are working to support the revitalization of the downtown district. If government is supporting you, your startup has half the backing it needs to become successful.In tech, it’s all about being ahead of the wave. Think of the location where you house your startup as the foundation that sets the mindset for the people you bring into it.

We hack policy The policymaking system — the process by which people in government make and enforce laws — has to change in order to prepare policymakers for the challenges introduced by technology and entrepreneurs. Current policy has not kept pace with innovation, and that hurts industry. For example, policies governing drones have fallen behind innovators, private industry and even other countries.There are many ways to change how policymaking and decisions are made— modifying technical architecture, upend legal regimes, organize the people, etc. — but our focus is to provide policymakers with the tools necessary to make more informed decisions.Startup Policy Lab does this through technology, research, and programming that informs the policymaking process.Policymakers have to make decisions. But policymakers generally don’t have access to high quality information (whether raw data, expertise or research materials) that can be impounded and acted upon quickly. The tools we build are designed to catalyze data-driven policy making.We believe that policymakers can make more informed decisions if they have access to a larger pool of expertise in the public, private and nonprofit sectors. This enables government to innovate as rapidly as society is evolving.No. We are builders and we are conveners — operating as a bridge to bring together different stakeholders, but we do not engage in direct advocacy. Our tools are scalable and help policymakers at the local, state and national level make more data-driven decisions.Government is only as effective as its resources. We believe the secret to innovating the policymaking process is to facilitate the access of resources for decision makers.We are a team of policy wonks and technologists with a passion for making government operate more effectively. Our backgrounds include academia, startups, government (like the World Bank and White House), big tech companies (Cisco) and nonprofits (Mozilla). We have deep roots in the startup community and government which allows us to bridge the two.Working with such a broad range of people has allowed us to develop an incredible community. One of our most critical partners and supporters is We work with a lot of other great organizations as well: public, private, nonprofit and community organizations.

Startups are like If you haven’t done a startup, or haven’t managed a digital product before, you might not be that used to planning for failure. So you might design a huge, beautiful bridge. A revolutionary bridge. A bridge that everyone will talk about when it’s completed.Guess what? Harsh truth is: you will never finish that bridge. Things will happen, other things won’t happen, sudden opportunities might arise, another interesting idea might steal some of your attention. You might only build half the bridge. Let’s say I’m wrong and you build much more, even at 99% completed, what good is a bridge that doesn’t make it across?A bridge does not get any traffic until it is complete. Place toll booths all you want, but without traffic they’re pointless. Nobody has use for an unfinished bridge like this. Without people passing through the toll booths, you’ll make it immensely difficult for yourself to prove that your bridge is worth expanding.By all means, dream big. Have a grand vision. Just don’t spend too much of your time planning for parts that are not absolutely necessary. Don’t waste potential investors’ time by telling them about parts you’re unlikely to be able to build. Focus on the primary solution. Getting people from Cliff X to Cliff Y, how nobody is doing that, and how much traffic you expect to get.Explain how the communities on the cliffs are growing, and how that would ultimately lead to a much grander bridge. Then explain what you need for now, just to start getting people across, and get people to abandon the outdated ferry which they’ve grown so accustomed to.Startup history is littered with Don’t lead yourself into a dead end.More by me:Dutch serial expat: previously Bulgaria, Istanbul, Moscow.

Word up, friends. It’s Sunday blog post time. Today I wanted to share a little bit about my experiences as a first-time startup advisory board member with My goals are to help other new advisors think about ways of adding value to the companies they’re working with, and to help the founders amongst you get the most out of your advisory boards.#Paid is all about connecting brands with influencers who are popular on Twitter, Instagram, Vine, Snapchat and Pinterest. As a brand, you get to search for influencers that line up with your goals and budget. Then, you connect directly with the influencers you’ve picked to create your campaign.(If you doubt this to be true, find a 15 year old and ask them who they think is famous. Lists of people defined as celebrities by this demographic are just as likely to include Vine stars and Snapchatters as musicians or movie stars.#Paid is located at the Actually, that’s not entirely true. I told co-founder Bryan Gold that I would love to be on their board if there was an opportunity. And he invited me!I met Bryan in London, Ontario about 18 months ago. I was facilitating a So reason number one was pretty much the fact that I already liked Bryan, and respected his deal as a person. We stayed in touch, and when I heard about #Paid I knew that I wanted to be involved.This wasn’t something I approached casually. I wanted to make sure I had something useful to offer.For the first couple of years of my career a huge part of my job was advocating for investment in social media. I’ve worked with clients and internal stakeholders to educate decision makers about why social media is like, really really important and useful. That means I’ve been in the types of roles that are now held by #Paid’s target customers.I also get to interact with lots of startups through my work with I’m also a diehard believer in the power of a strong network. Relationship building and strategic communications are core to my professional practice. I figured there might be some cool opportunities to put that to work in an advisory context.The #Paid team knows their space inside out. One of the most compelling things about the company is that they have deep and genuine relationships with influencers. Last time I hung out with the #Paid team, Chris Carmichael, Domain expertise is a key factor in what makes a company successful. This expertise means they can advocate for their influencers when working with brands. In turn, this means that campaigns end up hitting the mark for everyone involved.Tools-for-social-media is an unwieldy, crowded space. But it’s also a big and growing pie (the best kind of pie if you want a slice). There’s a reason why There’s a few different trends at play here that I can see: The shift away from Facebook as the dominant social communications platform towards Instagram and other networks. The post-millennial understanding of fame and celebrity. The ongoing rise of authentic, meaningful product placement as part of the consumer marketing mix.If I was promoting a consumer-facing brand that cared about getting teens and young adults excited about their products, damn straight I’d be interested in experimenting with #Paid. It’s a very easy company for me to recommend, and I think that’s a good sign.One of the other things I really wanted to do was to get all of the other advisory board members together to brainstorm some ideas. Not only did it seem like that would that be a cool networking opportunity, I also like the idea of combining our brainpower to see what ideas we could come up with.This hasn’t happened yet. Which brings me to my main failing as a startup advisor: I don’t really believe in “busy.” We all make choices about how to best spend our time. There’s only so many hours in a day, days in a year, years in a life and so on. It’s up to us as individuals to figure out what to do with that time.But I’m also aware that between a fun and engaging full-time gig with a team I really love, launching Making sure I contribute effectively as an advisor is, of course, on me. Setting time aside to think about #Paid is proving to be critical. In general, having a military-style approach to my calendar keeps me (mostly) productive, effective and sane.On the advisor side, it’s important to be realistic, open and communicative about your bandwidth and how you can best contribute. I also think it’s on us to coach the entrepreneurs to work with on the best way to get value out of our involvement.Here’s a few tips for getting the most from your advisory board based on what I’ve learned in the last few months.Include them in your shareholder/investor updates. Encourage new team members to reach out and introduce themselves. CC/BCC them on relevant emails. Add them to your company Slack channel. Let them know what your priorities are, and what they should be thinking about when they’re out there speaking to people on your behalf. The more you can do, efficiently, to include them, the more you’ll get out of the relationship.It’s really just about dopeness at the end of the day.

Today startups are seen as the “second coming of Jesus”, changing old industries and disrupting markets. Yeah we all love them. Heck, I also founded a couple of them.But I have this noxious gut feeling that we are propelling the same old viscous cycle of monopolization, capital accumulation, cartelisam and dehumanization.Almost every startup that made it big becomes this huge corporation instantly adopting the shitty corpo-establishment mindset. In the beginning they all love their customers, want to change things, be different, disrupt stupid outdated regulations and build a new sharing economy. But After the “honeymoon” is over they suddenly become these money seeking, power hungry, market dominators. Exactly the type of company they were disrupting in the first place.Software is eating the world. Technology is pretty cheap and huge companies are built around a simple app. Yet they raise billions not to improve the tech, not to improve the experience but for lobbying, fighting others, cornering markets and building monopolies.Many will say yeah but that’s capitalism, they have to make money, we are not living in a utopia.More money, more customers, more ads, more, more, more. Bullshit!Startup is a mindset. Exactly startups have shown us that YES you can care about your customers, YES you can offer the best service at fair price, YES you can innovate in a garage. And make money. Small teams that change everything without “take over the world” ego trip.There is one simple truth: people will always pay for the stuff they like. Just treat them right. Be honest, respectful and give your best. It’s that simple.Becoming monopoly is not the endgame. Becoming this huge corporation that forgets why it started in the first place is a 19th century mindset.Until we brake this cycle, we will build new startups to disrupt the old startups.Earthling. Passionate about mobile  tech. Curious about the design of stuff. Hunting for Xperiences. Normal is boring :P

Because I am a co-founder of a technology startup, people are often surprised when they learn that I have an MBA. Tech in general (and Silicon Valley in particular) can be very harsh to people with MBAs. After making my way into the tech community, here are a few pieces of advices that I have for those who want to make a mark in this sector.This goes without saying: if you want to live in water, swimming is not optional. The best way to make an impact at a startup and earn the respect of engineers is knowing how to code. It helps if you have a technical education, but two years of business school might have made you rusty. It’s probably time to update the older IDE on your laptop and start coding again. If you don’t have a technical background, you can start taking some online courses to help you learn the language of the streets in the Valley. An MBA friend of mine who figured out pretty early that he wanted to go the tech route started his online MS in Computer Science while he was getting his MBA. At my company, I take care of entire backend of our Are you itching to do a SWOT analysis of your company and your competitors? Is delivering value to users your top priority? Or maybe a “3Cs” and “4Ps” analysis? Hold on. First, you might want to use a common language people understand. Try to not to use words like strategy, top-level, value, framework, etc. in everyday speech; there are better words available. Secondly, stay away from frameworks — nothing puts off startup employees and founders more. Even if you have a framework in mind, just break it down into its components when communicating.Every now and then, you’ll be part of a conversation where people question why MBAs even exist. Don’t believe me? Watch the HBO show “Silicon Valley” and you’ll notice how the characters treat Jared. Unlike an engineering degree, an MBA doesn’t make you immediately productive at an startup. Even if you are involved in marketing or business development, which are critical functions, engineering will almost always take precedent at startups.We know you learned a lot at business school. Engineers have a tendency to get bogged down in details and often miss the big picture. Time to use your business skills! A good way to demonstrate how smart you are is to intervene at the right time, such as during product review meetings. You can (and should) bring in your market research and influence the product roadmap. But remember: don’t use buzzwords or frameworks when communicating.One of the main reasons people go to business school is for a powerful network. Additionally, you learn and polish your people skills at b-school. You should also use them to contribute to your startup: you can connect with a venture capitalist you know from your business school network or even get in touch with a contact at a firm your company can partner with.I see a lot of people with MBAs in Silicon Valley, yet a majority of them are working for big companies like Google and Facebook. Many people think that MBAs don’t add value to startups and can be useful only in big corporations. I would love to see more MBAs taking the plunge into entrepreneurship.Using technology, data and business to impact lives!!This is a collections for articles about business including startups, business developments, and management.

Americans Have No Idea About O2O, Said By Baidu CEO: What’s The Real Truth of Chinese O2O Startups?Recently, CEO of Baidu.com, Robin Li put words in media, saying that baidu want pull off from Nasdaq because of US investors have no idea of what baidu is doing in the O2O trend and lowered its market value. Baidu is a component stock in Nasdaq since 2005. And since its listing, Robin is earning a lot for his investors. It’s not that easy to pull off from the public market.Can you imagine it’s much more cheaper to eat at home rather than eat outside? Yeah, that’s real in China. By using O2O apps, it could save you more than 50% if you have a quick finger and normal luck.As you can see, Dicos offers user a huge discount: save 11 for every 20 RMB, 16 for 37 RMB. A 45% was offered normally to normal customers.And to car/cab-calling service, the discount us unbelievable. You may think the discount won’t last long, but actually the discount is continuing for…almost 3 years. Major car and cab services in China is provided by Didi and Kuaidi. While the period they competing, the discount is amazing to passengers: you get two chances to take free taxi drive a day ( less than 10 RMB). During the Spring Festival of 2015 in China, young people find it’s almost free to travel around the city. And with food delivery O2O, life expense is nearly zero!But as the competition went less furious and the decreasing confidence of investors, big discount were seen less than before but still exists.From group buying to food delivery, from grocery shipping to to house massage, people can live a full life without going out side of his house. China local Internet media QDaily editor did a test last month, he lived a 18-day happy life without step out his house by using O2O services. We often heard that people can’t live without Internet, now this time people can live only by O2O services. However only in China can this be true.After our observation, TNiC editors found O2O startup in China provide service from What President Xi Jinping said the China standard is real! The O2O startups are providing very high standard service to its users. For examples, the hot pot food delivery O2O, if you buy their hot pot suite on apps, they would send you a real hot pot pot to use. Yes , for free! Or one food delivery would assign several delivery man in one restaurant in order to make the food is delivered in time and make sure the quality is good. All what they do is to attracts and high customer retention rate.Many fields in USA were not fit to use the O2O model. For example wedding O2O is not fit. The industry is quite muture which startups were not able to break or disrupt. O2O were quite fit the business area where there exists a lot of freelancers and party time workers.As we searched in Google, we would find that many O2O startups are limited in fitness and beauty and food delivery.Unlike China, the service industry sucks. But what we see today is that with the help of Internet and Apps, their service efficiency and quality bumps. And to our surprise that Chinese users are more acceptable than we thought. One reason is that the high population density in big city leads a lower human resource cost.And the enterpruners mental guide “Xiaomi” showed them: success comes from the Internet. And that influence Chinese government, they are encouraging startup founders to go outside to found a company to increase the employee rate. And to many businessmen, the O2O trend is a very good chance for them to pitch around.First, those O2O startups hold a high burning rate. And many of them never shows a possibility of profit in the near future or the further future.Fourth, customer won’t keep on using their service. As they first tried it, customer would find its interesting to use but to a long term usage, fewer would insist.Discount is a bad boy. He lies and may lies a lot.

Working on a start-up can take a ton of effort, but it is well worth that effort if your startup grows into a profitable company later on. Often it requires a lot of time and commitment to turn a start-up into a profitable business, but luckily there are many accelerator programs that can help make this A LOT easier.The usage of start-up accelerator programs has slowly but steadily escalated to being one of the most sought out programs for new businesses as of late. Tons of start-up accelerator programs are popping up across the globe and apparently participating in one of these programs has become a rite of passage for many young entrepreneurs.While there are many excellent accelerator programs available, there’s also no shortage of not-so-good ones that fail to deliver any positive results. Unfortunately it’s not so easy to distinguish a good accelerator program from a bad one.The industry of accelerator programs is relatively new, and more and more companies are popping up each day. The fact that little to no data is publicly available about the performance of these companies only complicates matters further.It can take quite a lot of work to find the programs that are both effective and suited to your goals, especially if you aren’t looking for them in the right place. Fortunately, you don’t have to toss a coin or play a game of Russian Roulette to choose what program is best for your start-up, we’re here to help!Here are 21 startup accelerator programs we recommend, and we hope you will find effective at helping your startup reach success earlier…Surge is a company that is packed with decades of experience.

Lead by Thomas Korte, who is accompanied by 6 other partners who were formerly working for Google, there’s little to no doubt they know what they’re doing when it comes to helping start-ups.AngelPad provides mentorship and seed money to help your start-up, and they’re even generous enough to give their students/clients an option for $100,000 in capital from two venture capital firms at the start of their class.AngelPad also helps with brainstorming, fundraising, and finally a “Demo Day” in which start ups get the chance to show off in front of hundreds of investors.AlphaLab is a well-known accelerator program that helps innovative startups to launch quickly and successfully. An average of 6–8 companies are selected to take part in their program twice each year. The selected companies receive funding, mentorship, AND office space in one of their establishments.With 20 weeks worth of intensive training under AlphaLab, companies will undoubtedly reach their goals and achieve product-market fit through rapid iterations of product, feedback, and data analysis. And they also have a “Demo Day” … but what makes them even more powerful is that AlphaLab will carefully select investors inside the country to maximize your ROI.MassChallenge is recommended for the If the previous accelerator programs tilt on the aggressive side of scaling product innovation, MuckerLab is a completely new innovation unto itself. They have an option called “Mucker Capital” wherein they put their trust in their selected entrepreneurs by funding their seeds. They also have a “Pre-seed” system which allows new startups to slowly build a stable economic presence through scalable tools and services like web apps.With a focus on technological based start-ups, this accelerator program aims to assist entrepreneurs engaging in scalable-technology such as Mobile, Gaming, Software, and E-commerce on a global scale.The Brandery is one of the top ranking accelerator programs in the US (specifically, based in Ohio). It prioritizes in start-up branding, marketing, and design. To them, building company image and branding is just as important as the product or service itself.

And you’re probably thinking And the numbers are scary: in Brazil every year universities lose close to Now that’s aThough we were not the first company addressing the issue, we tried a different approach. We choose to create a Our first MVP was called Students would buy vouchers. With those they would be able to send us questions and we would answer them all via e-mail.After a few months of trying different solutions, we arrived at one important finding about how young people study in Brazil:That time experimenting helped us to better understand our users. As much as we knew from being students ourselves not long ago, things change real After Borderline genius, he just He’s in it for the fun. Classes and grades don’t matter much, he studies sporadically, usually in the last possible minute and he’s definitely not above cheating.

The lack of a good base education makes her study twice as much as everybody else, learning doesn’t come easy. She’s tense, and a bit stressed. There’s only enough nails to bite.She’s the perfect student, dedicated, smart, organised. She has a complex schedule that is almost religious.

Being Asian, I was brought up in a rather conservative family which puts importance in getting a good job for a good, established company. Early on however, my personal search of the ideal job has always been to find something with the right balance of work and life (a loose word that describes free, unscheduled time that I could never decide what to do with anyway). Considering I don’t do much outside of work, a better life at this point simply means less time working and more time living.In my early search, my biggest concern was finding the right company that conforms to those ideals. The formula I had was simple; the company needed to be a startup, and the work needed to be creatively-fulfilling. These were two of my self-imposed requirements; they were proven tough to match in Malaysia, who had a fairly young startup scene at the time.I ended up working for a digital agency that had a startup-ish culture, and some of the most talented people. It was exciting for a while, but work quickly turned mundane. Contrary to general belief, “creative works” in an agency can quickly become uninspiring, largely contributed by the clients’ obsession with ‘how’ a project should be executed rather than ‘why’. This lack of purpose in your work fuels frustration; But then, a much-needed break. A new team called Labs was formed within the company (to which I quickly expressed my interest), and it was the beginning of one of the most creatively-fulfilling period of my early career.Working with a startup is, for most part, pretty close to what they advertise it to be. You have full autonomy over the work that you do, your working hours are more flexible, you get free food (or mostly snacks, in our case) plus many other freebies (conference tickets, client’s product discount etc). My workplace happiness spiked, and stayed at a high for the longest period of my career.I was genuinely happy again.But I also realised something else, that most of my happiness did not just come from those material perks. There’s a tremendous, often under-appreciated value in working with people with good heart — people who wants to see you grow, who sincerely care about you as a person, people who cares about the quality of work that gets produced, who pours their heart out into the work that they do. I was blessed to have been surrounded by such people.Sometimes it’s easy to be distracted by all the material perks that startups offer to their employees today, to think that the more we get the happier we will be. What goes beyond those perks are the people. You can only consume so much material perks, but without good-hearted, talented people to call your colleagues and friends, your happiness curve would likely dwindle down as fast as it went up.Designer at Atlassian.

For startups that haven’t found it, Product/Market fit can seem just as elusive and fictitious as Harry Potter’s Golden Snitch. Or worse, true love - with friends that have found the secret to smitten customers telling you, ‘you’ll know it when you see it’.But this is what lean methodology is for right?Yes, wave the magic lean wand, whisper ‘hockey stick growth’ three times and everything will be fine. Or it should be, but in our experience trying to optimize for Product/Market fit for ourselves and others, the reality is we often conflate lean methodology and agile development.We hear that we’ve got to ‘iterate faster’ and ‘reduce cycle time’. This is true, and many focus on doing this through optimizing for what we call ‘work done’.Optimizing ‘work done’ is powerful once we know what to build. But it’s only half of lean methodology. The other half is customer discovery/development. While we all know this, in practice because executing agile is so clear, and customer work can be far more vague, often the former is the focus over the latter.To benefit from lean, startups need to be executing on both during their sprints. Doing one without the other is like rowing a boat with one oar. You can get to the other side of the lake, and it’s better than having none at all, but you’re going to be rowing in a few circles before you figure your shit out.We have no magic tool to give you, no book to read, and no secret growth hacks to make this possible. We do have an oar in the form of a practical way to bake in customer development experiments into your process, by writing one email each week.(Note: actual number of tests would be 4–5 per week with 3–4 insights emerging from each).We send this email to a trusted circle of mentors/advisors. It’s sent every Monday without fail, whether at 4pm or 2am. Its ingredients are three simple parts:It’s this last point that keeps us doing this week after week. When we all talk about ‘lean’, ‘validation’ is never far behind, but it’s not even 1/10th of the value of the method. Its true value is in opportunity — to not just validate if your customer is single and could fall in love with your product, but understand their heart so well that they will.So how do these pretty words look in practice?We’re looking at a product that makes content in physical conferences accessible online, to professionals in emerging nations.Using testing we validated that cost to travel overseas and ticket price were huge pain points as expected, but we also discovered many potential attendees couldn’t attend due to visa issues.Opportunity! We wonder if targeting attendees to a conference from countries that have harder visa requirements for them will pay off in cheaper CPAs and higher NPS scores.Will it? We’ll let you know in next week’s email.The format, and outline of this email like everything else has been a test (so meta!), which this blog post, in provoking discussion has surfaced some interesting insights for through feedback:

Everyone has ideas and more often than not they have very little practicality. No one does an honest job of vetting their product or service through the proper channels and that is because there really hasn’t been many trustworthy places to do so. Instead of sharing your new amazing idea for a product or service with a few friends and family who are undoubtably going to agree with you and promote your enthusiasm, why not get some real honest feedback from other individuals who are going through the same troubles as you?

Last week I introduced my company 1AU-Ventures to my LinkedIn and Twitter network. I thank everyone for his or her best wishes. One important question remained unanswered, and I am glad it drew your attention. Why did I call a startup accelerator 1AU?“AU” stands for “Astronomical Unit” and “1AU” defines the distance between our planet, the Earth, and the Sun. As a child, I was a hobby astronomer. I had a small, and not so powerful, telescope that I used to look at the stars. I enjoyed venturing to the Moscow Planetarium to listen to lectures given by famous scientists. In school, I preferred physics to mathematics because it seemed like something I could aspire to touch. I would get absorbed into it, and relished exploiting the boundaries of it. With my extensive experience in business, the name “1AU” not only has great personal meaning to me, but also is very relevant to the efforts seed companies undergo in their first funding rounds, growing up, and reaching for the stars/ scaling up internationally.The difference between a good entrepreneur and a great entrepreneur is the ability to understand their “why”. Every great entrepreneur I’ve had the pleasure of encountering has a few traits in common: resilience, flexibility of mind, hunger for knowledge and courage. There are a multitude of physical processes to becoming the next supernova. My coaching process in 1AU combines company’s unique situation, McKinsey-influenced methodology, and access to a global executive network. If you want to reach the stars, the rigorous principles learned in a business school, will be challenged daily. Difficult tasks will be broken into a series of small strategic steps, and defining weekly, monthly, and yearly goals will only help companies focus and become great that much quicker.

After 10 years in investment banking, I walked away to do something with blogs? Yes — I did that.But the journey is less about what I did and more about why I did it.Rewind to 2003. I’d just graduated from college (or ‘uni’ as they say in the UK). I had no money, no experience and no professional network, just your average bright-eyed kid eager to find her way in the world and fulfill an obligation to her typical Asian parents. (Read: land a stable job!)Investment banking was exhilarating. I traveled the world on the corporate dime and was paid to learn a cutting edge field of finance and equity derivatives.But I missed home.After a year, I transferred back to Hong Kong with Barclays. Markets were booming in Asia and I found myself unexpectedly on a fast track and being courted aggressively by headhunters. I climbed a rung or two, joined a rival outfit at Morgan Stanley and was ultimately lured back to Barclays to work for my former boss….. seven years had passed between the two firms and I still hadn’t caught my breath.Work was exciting and I was paid well (obligation to parents fulfilled!), but I’d hit a roadblock of sorts. I was missing something from my life.I looked back on my career, at what motivated me to wake up at 6am each day for market open.Turns out it wasn’t the salary or the career progression, but the responsibilities I had taken on outside of my regular job. I was Chair of the Women’s Network, I’d set up the Women Inter-bank Networking Group (a group that brought together 18 Women’s Networks in Finance and has since expanded to Japan and the UK), and was on the Board of an educational non-profit. I was more interested in these entrepreneurial ventures than in closing the next big trade or becoming a Managing Director.I was happier building organizations of my own and making an impact beyond the bottom line.Surely, I thought, if I could channel the same energy and passion I had for these extra-curricular pursuits into a company of my own, I’d be much happier.Necessity is the mother of invention (again).It was October 2012. After a frenzied month of work meetings, budgets and planning sessions, I was desperate for a vacation. I wanted a holiday that was truly unique and nothing like the usual resort junkets provided to big media publications and featured writers. I wanted the opinions of travel bloggers — people doing what they love and sharing those experiences in a detailed and meaningful way.It’s been just over a year in the making.Startup life is invigorating and demanding. There are unique challenges and the only constant is uncertainty. But I wake up everyday fired-up to fix a problem for millions of people; ensuring they can connect with incredible blogs. Notey just closed a seed round of funding and we are tackling what could possibly be one of the largest problems in the content space.Co-Founder of Notey (

It’s fantastic to change the world with a startup and the experience can be intoxicating, especially if there is But this creates the temptation to ignore details like startup finance, which can then lead to the Some people believe that this means using large and complicated spreadsheets and a team of financial experts. But these supposedly sophisticated approaches can result in more confusion than clarity.Forget spreadsheets, think If you are running a software as a service company with a customer who prepays a one year contract for US$1,200, that’s great for your cash flow. Your revenue, however, is US$100 for that first month because revenue can only be recognized in line with the business services provided.This example highlights the essence of accruals, which match revenues with costs when calculating profits. This is the core idea underlying the income statement, otherwise known as the PL (you can technically use a cash based PL but very quickly you will run into the need to understand accrual based accounting, so better to start sooner rather than later).Because accrual profits are not exactly cash, the PL is like a movie based on a true story. The core message of the PL is usually similar to the underlying reality of what happened, but typically the details are changed for the sake of maintaining the story. At the extreme, even the core message can be distorted to the point where the PL does not represent reality in any way. It is possible to be a profitable company and still run out of cash.A startup with a cash position of US$50 million may appear healthy at first glance when looking at the balance sheet. If, however, that cash was generated solely from selling equity to investors, then the cash by itself does not actually give much context about the level of health.Thus, although the most important number on a balance sheet for an early stage startup is the cash balance, it is only the starting point for thinking about the company’s financial position. Cash must be placed in context as part of the overall balance sheet and also cash flow changes over time.If the PL is like a movie based on a true story, then the balance sheet is like a photo. The star of this photo is the cash balance but the balance sheet also captures many other details, some more important than others, at a specific point in time. Moreover, to truly understand a business, these snapshots in time needed to be connected together.Accounting can get very complicated but at the end of the day everything is related to cash flow. A fast growing company with US$1 billion in revenues may actually have negative cash flow because of high working capital needs.There are different categories of cash flow, and it is important to not get confused by things which sound like cash flow but are not. EBITDA, EBITA and other acronyms are not cash flow, even though some people refer to them by that name. True cash flow includes all cash in and cash out, with no exceptions.If the PL is like a movie based on a true story and the balance sheet is like a photo, then the cash flow statement is like a documentary. It’s raw and messy, which means that sometimes it can be difficult to keep track of the key themes. At its core, however, the cash flow statement usually does the best job of capturing the reality of a company.Accruals, balance sheet and cash flow are not independent of one another; they are fundamentally connected. Changes in the PL are reflected in each balance sheet and the cash flow statement can be reconciled by comparing the PL to changes in the balance sheet.The typical approach to accounting is to start with the details and ignore the underlying structure, which results in an incomplete understanding. Instead, take a holistic approach, being with the key concepts, and then the details will naturally become easier to appreciate.Start with the ABCs and then, once you understand them, you can move on to other Startups, karate and serendipity.

If you’re familiar with the tech, startup and or marketing scene you have probably been hearing a lot about live streaming. It seems like everyone is talking about Periscope, Meerkat, Mirrativ, Facebook Live.Who is going to dominate the live streaming space?My position on who will ‘win’ changed when Blab is a live public conversation between 2–4 people. Blab users tend to describe it as a sort of online dinner party. My tech friends have described it as a blend of Periscope and Google Hangout.Personally I think the best description would be that it feels almost as if the team behind The streaming platform I’ve used in the past only seem valuable at broadcasting what I want to say to my existing followers. What happens if you don’t have a following? Well, then you’re not going to get much value out of those.Blab though allows you the ability to interact with individuals who already have an established audience. A ‘nobody’ all sudden gets to ride on an already established user’s audience.I’m the CEO of The beauty  power of Blab is that it removes an additional layer of gatekeepers. While I was on Blab, there was a VC managing partner who was using Blab for office hours. With a single click, I was in a conversation pitching what I was doing to a managing partner of a fund.Anyone on the site can request to join into the conversation. Individuals join, express their opinions or remarks on the matter and then have the option of dropping out of the conversation at will.My first time on Blab I joined a Blab conversation within 5 minutes of being brand new on the site. I’m probably bias to the above opinion being a software developer, but I have also noticed a lot of not as technical savvy users using Blab as well.On Blab when I find a conversation of interest it feels exactly like what happens with Netflix. With Netflix it is, “One more episode” or in Blab’s case, “I’ll just spend 30 minutes talking”. Then it turns into 6 hours. All sudden you notice sunlight coming into your room and realize how much time you just spent.I believe that Blab is going to reshape networking and social discovery. It takes just a couple of minutes of testing it to make up your mind about it.The time sacrifice If you enjoyed this article, pleaseCEO of 

Há tempos venho pensando o quanto é difícil achar histórias verdadeiras sobre o sucesso de empreendedores. Não que muitas das histórias publicadas por ai sejam mentiras, mas digamos que são histórias (bem) superficiais do que realmente aconteceu, o que cria uma imagem totalmente distorcida na mente de futuros empreendedores.Em uma manhã, antes de abrir os e-mails, eu estava ouvindo algumas biografias e entrevistas, e em uma delas, feita com uma empreendedora, me chamou atenção a maneira como ela falava sobre o dia a dia em sua empresa, algo como Veja, não estou afirmando que temos que ser negativos e dizer apenas os problemas de construir um negócio, a ideia aqui é chamar a atenção para a superficialidade de como o empreendedorismo é contado. A maneira como falamos sobre os nossos negócios pode impactar muitas pessoas e inclusive motivá-las a mudar o rumo de suas vidas. Por isso, acredito que vale ser mais prudente ao expor uma história de sucesso, contando detalhes que realmente possam fazer a diferença.É fácil cair na armadilha de embelezar o que fazemos, isso é natural, temos a tendência de mostrar que é muito mais legal do que parece, as vezes até por que o objetivo é estimular àqueles que estão ouvindo a fazer parte disto também. E muitas vezes dá certo, quem não conhece alguém hoje em dia que quer ter seu próprio negócio? Fundar sua startup? Isso é ótimo, principalmente se a motivação vier de informações profundas sobre empreendedorismo e ajudar a evitar muitas frustrações neste caminho.Esta é apenas uma reflexão, e se ela fez você pensar melhor sobre como dar mais qualidade e nivelar por cima os detalhes contados dos seus cases de sucesso, então acho que já consegui de alguma forma fazer minha parte. Mas me conte, qual sua opinião?Founder, CEO of Aqui são publicados textos em português, com alma brasileira e conhecimento espalhado pelo mundo. Envie um reply para meu twitter 

Running a startup is akin to participating in a walkathon. You ask a lot of people for money and provide nothing in return. And, there are t-shirts. This is the absolute very best part of starting your own company. 100% cotton American Apparel jerseys embody everything you and your company stand for, so spend at least two weeks deciding on a logo and shirt color.They’d love to have you. Non-tech residents, particularly the impoverished and fringe classes, truly admire what the tech industry has done for their fine community. A private, elitist bus system, staggering rent, and a general whitewashing of the once vivacious city culture are just a few of the amazing contributions tech has made. Boy, would they love it if you came with a new startup. In fact, put on your sweet company t-shirt and announce your arrival at 16th and Mission around 3 a.m.Your first female employee is a crucial step in the evolution of your startup. She should be an intelligent, independent, and savvy woman who is willing to sleep with you. Ideally, her credentials include complex engineering skills and an MBA from Stanford. This high-profile and valuable experience make her ideal for a managerial role. Office manager will do nicely. Never again will your fridge run empty of Mountain Dew.On second thought, don’t hire a woman. She’ll make you appear weak at investor meetings and the likelihood of a sexual harassment lawsuit involving the CEO is too high.The last thing you want is for your company to appear professional or reliable in anyway. The wackier the better on this one. You really want to express the essence of your company’s mission — misguided and confusing— so don’t phone it in. Liberal use of extra vowels and consonants are encouraged as well as the reformatting of perfectly standard, and once easy-to-understand English words. For example, a company that helps you pick a company name, should be called Nameeezzz.io. Or, a terrible search engine could be called, Yahoo.When possible, shift your paradigm early in the morning after a light breakfast. Never attempt a paradigm shift without adult supervision or the presence of a Project Manager.Google’s entire campus is dedicated to changing the way the world eats at cafeterias. Its thousands of employees work tirelessly to improve the crispness of tater tots, engineer the orangest nacho cheese dipping sauce, and paradigm shift soft serve. This is truly an inspiring trip for anyone who wants to open a giant cafeteria. Restaurateurs and middle school principals will have their minds blown.Squeeze as many employees as possible onto one desk. The total lack of privacy will increase productivity, as your minions can police what others are reading on BuzzFeed and report them to the next highest ranking official, the Chief Executive President Intern Officer. Thanks for the inspiration sweat shops!Family members, investors, and successful fraternity brothers are all eager to help get your idea off the ground. It’s important to invest this money wisely in items such as company happy hours and catered lunches. However, the most important thing to do when borrowing money is to never pay it back. That’s a sign of failure. Always ask for more money.So far, so good… 

At this point, I’ve written quite a bit about the Now, I know that isn’t the easiest of things to do, and there may be all sorts of factors at play preventing you from being able to make this a reality (e.g. timing, location, career stage). But if you are at a place in your life where you do want to have a loving, committed relationship with another person, here are my suggestions for what you should look for.Please note these suggestions are tailored for startup founders, specifically. And why? Well, because you startup founders are different. You’re “crazy” enough to self-select out of the status quo in favor of venturing into the unknown to create something new and different. You’re some of the world’s most daring, bold, and visionary work-a-holics who dream big and back-up your desires with massive action. So as unique as you are, it’s important to recognize that your life partner needs to have certain qualities that will mesh well with your personality and lifestyle.So without further ado…Startup founders are society’s bada$$es (in the best of ways). You are bold, daring, and confident visionaries. You think of things that don’t yet exist, and you have the nerve to actually believe you can build it. With that said, you’re going to need someone who’s secure in who they are, confident in the intelligence they possess, and fully aware of their own worth, in order for you both to feel like you’re “on each other’s level.”As a startup founder, you are extremely busy. The majority of your waking hours are dedicated to your product, team, customers, partner orgs, and if you have them, investors. Because of this reality, your romantic partner will need to have their own life too. Someone who isn’t dependent on you for their happiness and experiences, but can fill their day up with their own activities, until you both get to the point in the day (or week) where you’re able to connect and recharge together.You are busy. Emergencies will come up, fires will need to be put out, the pressure will be on, and stress will always be closeby. With that said, you won’t always be in the best of moods or the most pleasant of individuals to interact with. You’ll need a partner who can exhibit patience and understanding as you traverse the mountains and valleys of the entrepreneurial journey.Things aren’t always going to go well. In fact, you have a 92% chance that things won’t end as you imagined and your startup will fail. Regardless of the outcome — whether you bump Uber out of the #1 valuation spot or you end up closing up shop like the promising Homejoy app recently did — you’re going to want someone who’s in your corner no matter what.Startuplandia’s definitely not Hollywood, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have its own glitz, glamour, and fanfare. Everyday, million and billion dollar valuations are casually discussed at co-working spaces and coffee tables around the country. New accelerators are popping up left and right claiming to be just the thing you need to succeed. There’s a constant run of conferences to always keep you filled up on the startup kool-aid. It’s just a lot, and you can easily get caught up in it, for sure. So it’s nice to have someone in your corner who’s grounded in other things that are important in life, like family, friends, and shared experiences. Sometimes, you just need to be around a loved one who doesn’t care how much revenue you made last month, what your CAC is, or what new features you’re launching next quarter.Now, with all that said, there are of course those folks who would advise you to avoid having a relationship while you’re building your company (especially at the early stage of your venture’s development). Fearful of distractions and piling on additional pressure to your already full plate, they’d tell you to steer clear of human love and just “marry your startup.” But I’d argue that So get on with it! Use this information to update your online dating profiles, open yourself up to meeting new people, and give yourself a chance to enjoy the benefits of having a great partner in your life, as you work hard to make a difference in the world.Checkout my site Portfolio Services Director at Kapor Capital | Founder of The Startup Couch | Forbes 30 Under 30 | TEDx Presenter | 

If you’re building a business, it’s not because you need somewhere to go every morning — it’s because you believe that you can make a great living doing something you love while having the freedom to do it your own way. Regardless of the type of startup you have (or dream of having), though, you know that you’ll need some money to realize your dream.I am all for you finding the money you need to build your business, and making sure that your dream (or more precisely, your control of your dream) doesn’t get crushed along the way. It’s what I help people do.But one thing I wish I could tell almost every startup founder out there looking for money is this:Although I don’t have statistics to back up that 91.2%, this I’m convinced of: almost every founder sees VC money as the Holy Grail of funding. It’s like New York — if you can make it with the VCs, you’ll make it everywhere.Don’t believe me? How many articles have you read aboutYep, getting VC money is an obsession. Being on Shark Tank, getting the headlines, the fame, the bragging rights…it’s heady stuff. Let’s face it, VC money is damn sexy.Whether you admit it or not, I bet that you’ve fantasized about telling your friends and family that you just closed a $[insert dollar amount of your choice] Series A round. Even if you’re not entirely sure what a Series A round is.You end up wasting time and energy on a process that not only doesn’t get you funded, it saps your attention and (worst of all) your confidence.Most people don’t realize that VCs (like every other industry on the planet) are subject to market conditions. When people with money to invest are looking for better returns (as they have been since 2009– if you want to learn more about the whys and wherefors, readInvestments like, oh I don’t know, startup businesses with a one-in-a-trillion or lower shot of becoming the next Google, Facebook, Uber, etc.Which is great news for folks who make their living taking risks by investing their own (or other people’s) money into startups. The last 6 years have seen tons of money flowing into VC type funds, chasing a (supposedly) better return than they can get in the stock market, junk bonds or the other investment options they have.And since those investors are expecting hefty returns on their investment, VCs have to invest that money somewhere. So it’s entirely possible that getting funded by a VC in today’s market has less to do with you and your company, and more to do with the need of VCs to invest all of the funds they’ve been entrusted with as quickly as possible.In fact, the opposite is true. The reality is that around 80% of VC investments are going to fail. Some estimates place the number as high as 90%.Sound unbelievable? Have a look at thisWhat does this data mean for you?As a founder, you have to face a very ugly truth. Getting funded by a VC (especially these days) is more likely to be the kiss of death than it is your ticket to the big time.Because what keeps your company alive isn’t getting funded just once, but having (hopefully) those same investors continue to invest in you down the line when you really need it.Like when you miss your milestones. And you will miss them. Maybe not all of them, maybe not the most important ones, but nothing EVER works out the way you planned it. Deliveries — whether they’re protoypes, betas, or even physical products — are always late. There are always bugs or problems. Those customers who guaranteed they would sign up on day one are nowhere to be found when you launch.Having enough money to not only to build your product/service, but to actually build a company that does what you’re passionate about while allowing you make a living or more — that’s what matters. And as the saying goes, Rome wasn’t built in a day — or with just one round of investment.I hope it’s because you choose NOT to pursue it.Face it, getting a VC to fund your company would feel really good, as would depositing a big fat check into your bank account.But before you invest months of your life and (hopefully not too much of) your hard earned cash in pursuit of that check, be honest with yourself about whether an equity partner is best for your business.And if it’s not, get off the crazy train. Do what’s right for you, not what’s going to impress others. After all, there are tons of ways to fund your business, but the truth is that most of them aren’t right for you.You just need to find the one that is.If you want to narrow down the field, takeWhatever kind of funding you pursue, believe in your company (and yourself) enough to be picky about who you work with and how.And whatever you choose, I wish you much success!If you enjoyed reading this and found it helpful, please recommend and share it.Recovering investment banker, champion of business owners, Frenchmans wife, mom of three.

When I was 26, I was on the verge of entrepreneurial collapse.My company, Spheric Technologies, was in a rapid growth phase, and I found myself in a constant struggle to keep my head above water.I was stressed out, running out of money, and unsure if I was fit for the job.I was taking more punches than I could take.One blow after another.I was ready to throw in the towel.And that’s when, in a moment of desperation, I sent out a life changing email (a cry for help was more like it).The goal:The result:3 In short…NOTHING has been more critical to my success than mentorship.And it’s this powerful, emotionally-charged relationship with mentorship that’s made me hold off on producing a video on the topic.But now, speaking as someone who’s been on BOTH sides of the equation (I get dozens of requests every week)…… I feel it’s time to do my duty and share the One of the biggest hangups that young entrepreneurs (and experienced ones alike) face when reaching out to potential mentors is that they feel they have WRONG.And in Step #3 (So I challenge you TODAY to watch the video and use these 4 steps to either find yourself a mentor, or deepen your relationship with the ones you currently have.To standing on the shoulders of giants,— DanFamily first!

The idea for this article came to me after my friend As we all know, content is one of the most important marketing channels for a B2B startup because it makes the website rank higher in the search engine, and attracts traffic and quality leads.Great content will also allow to build following, establish brand awareness, engage with the audience, build an email list and get product feedback.At first glance content marketing doesn’t seem as expensive as other types of marketing, such as paid search advertising or traditional marketing. But if you think about it, the employee would spend a lot of time creating and distributing content, so salary costs and time spent on content quckly adds up.If you don’t start with the strategy for your content, or don’t measure content efforts, you would not be able to demosntarate ROI and get the maximum benefits out of your content.Before setting out to create any content, you have to map out the foundations and be really clear about the core characteristics that define who you are as a startup.It is a good idea to brainstorm on these points together with the whole team:- “For ____________ (target customer)who ____________ (statement of the need or opportunity)”- “Our (product/service name) is ____________ (product category) that (statement of benefit) ____________.”“We believe that:__________.”“We value:__________.”Describe your company in adjectives. Are you “professional” or “informal” “practical” or “creative”, “humours” or “serious”, “adventurous” or “traditional”?It is a good idea to snoop around and check out competitors’ content marketing and note down what works for them- which blog posts are most read, which tweets are retweeted the most. Let’s call it inspiration research:) The best tools to be the James Bond and spy on your competition are gathered More often than not B2B companies don’t focus on defining and segmenting their target audience as precisely as B2C companies.You also need to map out the relationships between decision makers and buyers. For example, within enterprise A you defined three levels of decision making:Ross Kingsland advises to always try to get to the C-level person as you will avoid wasting time on back and forth permissions within that target company.A further way to understand your target personas and their preferences is developing use cases.You start by identifying who within the company is going to use your product or service directly. Describe what each persona wants to achieve with your product and what are the steps they are going to take in the process. Each of these steps become a use case.For example, you are selling a pricing optimization tool for e-commerce companies:This process will serve as a super powerful weapon in the content game against the competition, because you will learn to talk about the problem from the user’s perspective, use their language, understand their pain points and goals, and will be able to construct highly relevant powerful sales pitches and marketing messags.Chances are the potential customer isn’t going to buy your enterprise solution the minute they land on your homepage, or after reading 1 blog post.Mapping out the Buying Stages Matrix- all the stages that the customer goes through before and after purchasing your solution- is important because you can think about how your content will support the customer journey at every point.To start with setting up objectives for your content marketing strategy, you can begin from business goals for the next 6 months and move into marketing goals, zooming into content goals.Content objectives can be around these points:Ideally, your objectives should be SMART:You can then set up individual tactics, channels and content types related to each objective.We have all been there when there is a pressure to create consistent quality content: “I don’t know what to write about”.To avoid running out of content ideas, you can brainstorm with your team and think about the big picture of your customers- approach from a perspective much bigger than your product, bigger than your industry.Brainstorm and note down all your customer’s potential needs, questions, concerns, questions. If you are an e-commerce pricing tool, think about what your customer’s larger concerns would be: how to run a profitable online shop, what kind of products to stock, how to drive traffic to the store, how to outsmart the competition. Then note down all ideas related to each area of concern.Shopify is rocking it with it’s All their content efforts are geared towards championing their customers to become successful at online business.

Once you set up Goals, you can measure the value of social refferals on your website.To understand how people are interacting with your content, you would want to look at the average time on the webpage, and the bounce and exit rates. You can understand which content is working well with your audience, and which pages need improvement.And of course, look into analytics of each individual platform: Twitter has it’s own analytics, same with FB, Quora, Medium, and so on.

Hell is building fancy stuff that nobody uses.Since going freelance, I’ve talked to a lot of startup founders who are in search of the elusive ‘technical cofounder’. Instead of coding, I’ve tried to help them brainstorm how to get their product in front of people without writing any code. The people you hire don’t care about your ruby gems. Your users don’t care about your github profile. No one cares about your code. They care about what value you create.Building things that people use and love is incredibly challenging. As engineers, it can be hard to realize that making something more technologically impressive doesn’t make it any more useful. It is even harder to realize that code is an expensive liability. Just like the elements of your business or the features of your product, your code needs to justify its existence. Luckily, with the variety of small third party services, we can think, prototype and understand a problem before we ‘go to code’.My goto example of a codeless business is Kollecto. Tara Reed, the founder, previously did Business Strategy at Microsoft. While familiar with technology, she isn’t an engineer. Yet, in a couple months, she built a website that sends personalized art recommendations and facilitates purchasing the art. In addition to those user facing features, there is a backend for Tara to manage a staff of art advisors as they add new art and track sales. She created this by tying spreadsheets together with purpose-built web applications like In its first few months, Kollecto generated over Among engineers, there is tremendous animosity towards spreadsheets as a fragile faux-programming environment for ‘muggles’. While spreadsheets are fragile, they are also structured, easy to edit and highly portable. In some sense, a spreadsheet is a data format and a CMS rolled into one. Today, with their ability to integrate with almost any third party service, spreadsheets are one of our most powerful prototyping tools. Why build a complex onboarding flow when you can just use Typeform? Why make an email system when you can send the Typeform spreadsheet export to Campaign Monitor for conditional “personalized” emails?One of the biggest mistakes of engineer-driven companies is writing code before you understand the problem. At Artsy, we recorded subscription billing events in a spreadsheet and had someone manually process those charges based on that spreadsheet. While painful, it allowed us to understand the wide spectrum of billing states unique to subscription billing. We handled these transactions in a high touch way to understand them. By the time we go to code, the problem is well-understood. Even in a tech company with ample engineers, spreadsheets helped us move fast, learn and not break that many things.Does your website look like this? Most startup websites are a mess of hastily written features after a few years of brutal, startup-speed iterations. Your startup is not about ‘flexing’ all the awesome code you wrote. When it comes to robustness, a fragile spreadsheet is actually a diamond compared to a hastily written backend that you change 100x as you iterate on your product.While we have more incredible web frameworks than ever, we also have an astounding number of small, purpose-built web applications. We can use these to prototype our apps. They allow us to only code when we need to, and only code problems we understand well. Building products is a no flex zone. Don’t let flexing your coding skills get in the way of the building a great product that people use.Many thanks to 💻¯\_(ツ)_/¯🔌

My Co-Founder, Anita Chan, wrote a When I tell people that I moved from California to Hong Kong, I generally receive a puzzled look and the question, “Why?”The one and only answer? Because I love it here.During my first visit to Hong Kong in 2009, I fell in love with this amazing city and knew that I would move here one day. So what is there to love about Hong Kong?It is a very deep and dynamic city that has a lot to offer. I love that I can be having afternoon tea at the Mandarin Oriental in city center and then be hiking on a mountain 30 minutes later. I love that food ranges from HK$20 (US$2.66) to not having an upper limit. I love that the people and their interests cover pretty much anything under the sun.My love for Hong Kong is a big reason of why I wanted to create this platform in the first place. I want to give Hong Kong the chance to flex its muscles and charm its way into other people’s hearts, like it has done to me. I want us to be the opportunity and encouragement for people to go out and see all that Hong Kong has to offer. I love Hong Kong, and I want others to love it too. It has something for everyone, and that is exactly what I want to Sam the Local to show people.Additionally, Hong Kong has introduced me to amazing people, endless personal growth, and has given me the opportunity to expand my horizons beyond imagination. Hong Kong is an everyday reminder that I CAN achieve my goals and live a dream life. I want to give back to a city that has given me so much.Be it economically, socially, or culturally, I want to do my part in keeping Hong Kong as one of the world’s most vibrant cities. I don’t see my startup just as a way for me to make money; I see it as a way I can give back to a city that has changed my life for the better and make a significant, positive impact on it.People always told me to do what I’m passionate about, and now I get to do that every day by building Sam the Local in Hong Kong.Co-Founder of Sam the Local. I love life.

How I threw away my comfortable corporate job for a doomed idea… and why it was worth it. ☺It was a magical moment. Early last year I attended a Startup Pirates workshop in Budapest. We worked on a concept called Selftrace. We wanted to build a quantified self app, that combines all your health and fitness tracking data. Then it would synthesise it down to one health score. To tell you how well you are, in the most simple way possible.At this time I was still an employee of Citigroup, but already knew that someday I’ll quit and build my own business. My plan was to work for a few more years, build up enough savings, and when I have a great idea, when everything is perfect, then I’ll make my move.What happened, is that on the workshop I realised that I won’t be able to work for my employer any longer. The urge to start my own business got too strong. So at the workshop I took my phone, and wrote a mail to my boss. “Dear D, I loved working for you, but now it’s time for me to leave. I quit. Let’s talk next Monday.”I felt liberated. Finally, I could focus on building something that has the potential to change the world. A few days later, when the workshop ended, we had to realise that we can’t make Selftrace work. We had to let go of it.I just threw away my perfectly good career for nothing. #facepalmBut I was not worried. I still had about 30 days from my notice period, to figure out what I’ll do with my life. And just in time, there was a Why isn’t there a service that makes it easier for people to prepare for speeches? Hmm, why isn’t there one? Hmm, why not build one? That’s it! Let’s build a webservice that will help people develop their public speaking skills! Let’s call this Rate My Speech!Yay! The light bulbs went on, as I found my Next Big Idea.The basic concept was simple. We let users upload their practice speeches, and our community will give constructive, actionable feedback on how to improve. And of course we had a gazillion other feature ideas, and of course we could already see how we’ll conquer the world.We went to all the local startup pitch contests, and — maybe because we were in the business of public speaking — we could outpitch anybody. It felt amazing.We pitched our way into On a hungarian startup competition we won a 2 week journey into Silicon Valley — all expenses covered. Fortunately I had to wait until January 2015 for this journey, about which you can read Unfortunately, some months after the competitions, ratemypseech.co fell apart. There were just too many pivots, no clear direction that sticked for more than a couple weeks. The team scattered, we only had a crude prototype but no amazing product, and we couldn’t attract considerable number of users. This was my first serious, “all in” attempt to build a startup, and I managed to run into all the big mistakes. It was a painful, but valuable lesson.In retrospect, these were the main takeaways:I have to admit, I like pitching, and speaking in public in general. There is nothing better than standing on stage, in front of a huge audience, and wow them with your message.Unfortunately, when working on ratemypspeech.co I spent way too much time on stage, and not nearly enough time talking to my team and our users. So while all the pitch competition wins kept my ego well fed, we didn’t progress enough with our concept, and our team.As a consequence of #2, we didn’t have a CTO who dedicated enough time to our product. For some months, we got away with a slideware, then with mockups and paper prototypes.For a while it was even fun. It felt like we are doing the proper thing, follwing the Lean Startup way of quickly building something (that is crappy), learning from it (unfortunately, many times not the proper thing) and adjusting (after a while we just went in circles).But around July I just couldn’t take it anymore. I wanted a product. A real one. Not just a mockup. So what did I do? Instead of fully focusing on finding a CTO, or looking for other ways to get somebody creating the product, I decided to learn how to code and do it myself.Coding was on my bucket list anyhow, so I figured, this is the best opportunity to make it happen. So I took a 2 week crash course in Rails, and then spent 2 more weeks of creating the initial version of ratemyspeech.co.It was a painful month. On one hand I enjoyed learning how to code. On the other hand, I realised that I don’t want to do this. It’s just not for me. But I got what I wanted. Around August I launched a beautifully ugly ratemyspeech.co. From a functional point of view, it had 70% of what I imagined — user management, groups, comments and ratings, video embed…I could cross off one of my bucket list items. But from the startup point of view, this was nearly not enough to compensate for the lack of an engaged team, and talented CTO.Eventually I had to realise that our basic concept was flawed. Most people (95+%) just don’t care enough about their presentations. So they will not take the time to prepare a draft speech, upload it, expose it to scrutiny, then take the feedback onboard and rework it.The rest, the less than 5% on the other hand takes it very seriously, and many of them have a strong network of people who they can ask. But they wouldn’t pay for some service to make this a bit easier. For them, we would not be able to deliver value.I’m sure that after a while we could have found a market niche, where we could create some value. But that would be a very small market, and especially considering #1 and #2, we just couldn’t make it happen.Overall, I’m glad that I made the hasty decision to quit. I’m also glad that I could let go of my startup idea. This enabled me to make a clean start early this year.Since then, I’m working on If you want to know more about the startup studio model, trends, funding, then check out my research:Learn more in the full report:Entrepreneur, CEO of Firmpalace.com, startup studio pundit

Archana Doshi, of Now she is ready to build a team of people with the same passion as she has, and grow the business further. She has become synonymous with the Successful Indian Woman.When So if you want to be inspired by this enterprising young mom, read on!I was always working, I was an engineer. Then I had my children, and I quit. Around two years, after I had my baby I decided I wanted to do something. It was around this time that I started getting a lot of requests from my friends for the recipe of formula baby milk and baby cereal that I had created on my own.I was also looking to keep my technical skills updated. Blogging meant that I could put my technical skills to some use and combine it with my passion for cooking. So initially I started off by blogging on Blogger about baby food, but within a few months I had moved on to my own website. Blogging about vegetarian food and healthy recipes happened automatically, somewhere along the way.I did not. I did not consciously think that I could make this my living. But I did have ads right from the start. But initially my only focus was on cooking, blogging, sharing photographs and interacting with my readers. It was only later that I started thinking seriously about monetization. But soon ads, cooking classes, catering, sponsored posts and youtube videos started happening one by one.Back when I started in 2007, I suppose you had to have a minimum technical skill level to be a professional blogger. Blogger was the popular platform back then and if you were blogging on a No. Apart from the website, nothing much. I am using my home kitchen for everything. Of course, the camera was something I had to make an investment in, and I do have a team that edits my videos, but that was much later. To convert my home kitchen into a studio, all I did really was to buy a few lights and get that setup. And they are not expensive. Something like Rs.500.Well, between 2007 and 2011 I was doing a lot of things besides just blogging. I was taking cooking lessons, catering and generally involved in multiple activities. As a part of my cooking lessons, I was doing demonstrative cooking lessons via Google Hangouts. And 99% of the people attending the classes were people outside India. So there was a time-zone issue. So even though I was cooking, they would simply be watching me, and not cooking with me. So that’s when I realised that I could use Youtube, and people could look at the videos whenever they wanted. That’s how that happened.Yes and no. When you start off, it’s important to explore many areas. Then you need to find the one thing that inspires you, what you are passionate about. And then cook those things and write about it.I completely enjoy the food that I cook and I am extremely comfortable writing about it. That should be the bigger focus. Rather than finding a niche, find a comfort zone. Don’t blog about something simply because it’s trending.Content is definitely the most important. But equally important is knowing your audience. Engagement is hugely important. I respond to every single comment on my page. And I take their feedback. If someone tells me something is wrong, I accept that and incorporate it. It happened recently with this interaction from my And this engagement gives you an insight into what people are looking for. So when I was posting cake recipes with egg, I started noticing that people were asking for an eggless version. So then I realised there is an audience for this.Yes. So for instance, when it’s super bowl season in the United States, the recipes for dips and snacks will increase at this point. Similarly, when it’s festival season, recipes for traditional sweets and recipes sees an increase in traffic.I definitely think there’s a connection. I think it’s the one way I’m giving back to my community.I do traditional recipes when there’s a big festival because I feel it’s a time to reflect on your own culture. When everyone is trying to turn to the west for healthy yoghurts and dips, we tend to forget our own Kuchumber or Raita. So I do try to promote our culture through my food. Because, at the end of the day, they are precious memories for me, and I would like to create beautiful memories for others too.I do work with a lot of brands. Honestly, with KitchenAid I was connected by a distributor. And then when I started popping up in the results when people were searching for KitchenAid, they took note of that. And that’s how I was able to build a relationship with them. When I started food blogging, it was much harder, especially for a food blogger from India.But I wasn’t bothered because at least it was paying off my website. But now things are so different. The digital space is so very popular in India and there are so many ads which are India-centric. Now if I were to make an estimate, in a couple of years, if you are good, you could make $500 a month in India, from ads.Besides at that point, there were no places that you could go to in order to find a community with a particular interest in food, who could become your loyal audience. So we had to keep scouting the internet. Pinterest, Food Gawker and all these other things were not as popular back then.Even brands trust bloggers more. They know the reach for digital marketing. And it’s cheaper than TV. So more and more brands are turning to bloggers to promote their products.I’m not saying it’s easy now. But, it’s certainly easier. But the one thing you do need is passion. You need to love what you are doing to make it as a food blogger. Also, you need to be doing the right things, in terms of SEO, being regular, photographs, the look and feel of your website etc.Well, not in many ways. But now since people associate me with Archana’s Kitchen, I am careful of the image I represent. Since Im blogging about healthy food, I would need to be fit. So I’m aware of that. With the Youtube channel as well, I have realised that it’s important to dress in a certain way. Initially, I was just wearing whatever. But I was watching Masterchef and other shows, and I noticed they all have a signature style. So I too have decided to try that out now. So I went through a phase of buying the exact same kind of clothes. I would say these are some of the things.From starting off a blog on baby food to rubbing shoulders with Vikas Khanna and a host of other prestigious chefs in India and abroad, Archana’s journey is truly motivating. Even though, she is expanding her enterprise with more people, more projects, and more exciting ventures, Archana still finds the time to help new bloggers. She is always striving to achieve her vision, and will continue to do so.Journalist, writer and dreamer.

Since then I have worked on at least four different ideas, over the course of three years, while having a full-time job, until finally raising money for This post is my attempt to summarize my learnings/techniques for bootstrapping a startup without quitting your full-time job into 5 tips. Without further ado, let’s jump right in.If you are going to build a world class company/product while spending over 9 hours a day working on something else, you need to be super efficient with the rest of your time. And by super efficient I mean don’t waste even a second that you can use to push the needle forward.Here is how I did it. When I was walking or driving to work, I would listen to audio books about building better companies — from This one might sound less generic than the others but it’s really important so it deserves some special attention. If you want to build a company alongside a full-time job, go and live very close to your day job. Doesn’t matter if it’s expensive, or if it’s uncomfortable, just do it. There is no other way. Commute is the worst time sink ever. Most people I know spend from 1–2 hours a day on their way to work and the reasoning goes — When you are just starting off building a product, it’s easy to make the assumption that you are supposed to build everything yourself. After all, that’s what they teach you in college — start from a blank page, fill it up with code, and make something cool. However, in the The good news is that there are so many open source projects out there and modern frameworks have advanced so much that almost anything This one is true for all entrepreneurs but it’s especially true for moonlighting entrepreneurs. Keeping your motivation up is super challenging and that challenge doubles when you are doing your startup alongside a full-time job. When you have a day job you are always more tired, and you always have an excuse to stop working on your idea without any serious consequences. One way to change that is to get a co-founder. It’s easier said than done but trust me, finding the right person to build your dream with you really pays off.When you have a co-founder who believes in the startup as much as you do and who is as invested personally as you are, it’s much harder to quit without a serious reason. When you have a co-founder, your idea or startup is no longer something that you can just stop working on; you can’t just forget about it and move on. Quitting with a co-founder means you fail another person who followed you into battle. Quitting with a co-founder means that you are backing away from everything that you told him/her to convince them to join you.It seems like if you have a full-time job it should be easy to put money on the side for other needs and yet that never happens. Hence you almost never have much cash in-hand outside of your monthly salary. This is especially true if you live in places like San Francisco or New York where just your rent is more than half of your salary. For an entrepreneur this means not having the money your startup might need to start taking off. The last thing you want is to build a product and not have enough resources to market it, brand it, or scale it. But with some creativity, you can build and scale a startup to thousands of users with almost no money.For my first startup, I didn’t know about As you can see from these tips, for moonlighters, it’s all about Have you bootstrapped a startup while working full-time? Are you working on one now? Got any additional tips or questions? Post a comment below and let the discussion begin!Co-Founder/CEO @ CodeFightsStartup thoughts from the CodeFights Crew

A glance at tech publications might perpetuate the mistaken notion that startup success is the norm. But that’s far from the reality. A VC-funded startup’s chances of success, That means that three out of four times, your startup is doomed to fail.Yes, those numbers are very low, and so is the money involved in joining a startup. Salaries are a far cry from those in the corporate world, and the chances of a startup employee — regardless of whether he or she is the first or the last — cashing out in an exit is Why would anyone in their right mind actually join a startup?The main draw, in short, is the much-hyped ‘startup culture’. You know, the one that promises amazing perks like flexible working arrangements, no strict management hierarchy, an unlimited vacation policy, and a ping pong table.These small companies set ambitious goals, too: to be a billion-dollar company, to make the world a better place, to rid the world of poverty — the list goes on.Most importantly, it’s about the feeling of working alongside a group of talented, like-minded individuals who are prepared to go to incredible lengths to get the job done — and then some.Without a happening startup culture, these small tech firms would go out of business in a heartbeat. And that might just be the problem.Recently, there was the On one hand, some netizens felt that there was absolutely nothing wrong with making fun of those who would prefer to work in the corporate world. Some even applauded it, saying that this was the way to weed out those who might not have the drive necessary to work in a startup.They may be right. Working at a startup certainly requires a unique tolerance for risk and failure, something that a well-sheltered employee in a big corporation might not possess.And I say This is not to knock the choice of words in that ad. The idea of wanting to find the best culture fit for their company is admirable.This, however, points to a larger problem with our startup ecosystem as a whole — we’ve become a boiling cauldron of discrimination, and What about prejudice against those beyond a certain age? Here’s what legendary Facebook founder As we know today, there are Overt discrimination happens not only in Silicon Valley, but in Asia as well. In Malaysia, for example, the process of applying for government grants becomes politicized because of what is called a “bumi-quota”.According to a Malaysian entrepreneur, who prefers to remain anonymous, a now-defunct government program that he participated in used to put aside a certain percentage of their grant funding for bumiputeras, a term referring to the Malay race.“The remaining 50 percent or so was fair game for everyone else though — [which was why] I got it,” he adds. “I was told about this from a credible source — a senior official — but he said it in conversation, it isn’t written anywhere explicitly. However, I think most founders were quite aware of this, because its the same policy for almost everything in Malaysia.”Among startups, though, he says that prejudice is very rarely seen. “There is much less [discrimination] in the private sector because we want profit, and so we need to reward based on merit,” he explains, and adds:Discrimination is very much a mindset as it is a practice. One can be biased against a member of another race by calling them a name, as much as they can by unconsciously feeling uncomfortable when being in the same room as him or her.Let’s talk about tech sexism for a while. Ariel Schrag from Discrimination becomes extremely dangerous when it is endemic, because then it simply becomes exclusion for the sake of it. The same can easily apply to startup hiring processes.Today, it might be the exclusion of a certain type of person because, generally speaking, they don’t fit in at startups. Tomorrow, that might evolve to prejudice in the interviewing process just because a candidate walks in wearing a suit. In fact, it’s Startup culture is, by its nature, anti-establishment.It broke the rules that corporations demanded employees follow.It emphasized fun, freedom, and a focus on the right things.It turned its nose up at discrimination — fancy degrees and affiliations — and brought people on simply because they got the job done.We need to find our way back to accepting, as Content strategist Bringing you stories on Asian tech and startups.

Today is a very big day in the history of Switchyards Downtown Club. We are announcing the first startups to join the Switchyards community!(here is Even though the building isn’t set to open until the fall, a few weeks ago we decided that we should announce the first three or four companies to give the Atlanta startup community a sense of the types of companies that will be in Switchyards.So we identified ten great target companies and teams with the hopes that we’d get three of them to toss their hats into the ring at this early date…we were totally blown away and humbled when eight of them committed early!Also, as we were working through this process, two interesting things occurred to us related to what we are trying to do at Switchyards. First, the product/consumer/design-focused startup community is a small part of the overall startup community in Atlanta. The local startup community has a long history with security, medical  financial startups, but far fewer founders, developers, designers, marketers, investors, etc are focused on consumer-focused startups.What also became apparent is that a focus on such a new segment in Atlanta means that the companies are typically much earlier in their development. As an example, if you are starting an online security startup in Atlanta, you’ll likely run across co-founders, employees, investors  advisors who can help accelerate your efforts. Because these basic building blocks aren’t in place in Atlanta for consumer startups, many of these efforts are slow to progress from the idea stage to launch to initial traction.Both of these findings renewed our belief that a building like Switchyards is needed to pull all these ingredients under the same roof and help catalyze the consumer efforts in Atlanta. Over the next few months, we’ll share even more of our plans on how best to support and accelerate consumer startups in Atlanta…stay tuned!So here are the “initial eight” startups to join the Switchyards community. Not only are they great examples of promising consumer  design-focused startups in Atlanta, but they are just great people that we want to see around the building every day at Space: Local moving and lifting helpOverview: Founded in 2013 and now at large in over 130 cities, Bellhops is an online platform for physical help on demand.

Most would agree that working for a startup is an exciting / stressful / fun / scary experience, and yes, all those emotions can exist together. I started working at Chameleon just over 30 days ago. I came from being employed with one of the biggest tech companies in the world, SAP.Back in college, I worked full-time for another powerhouse in its respective industry — Bank of America. There are lots of benefits to starting off your career with a big company. Exposure to standard business processes, increased learning opportunities, and access to mentorship are all part of the deal.Whether your early career is at a startup or a big corporation, one should not underestimate the importance of SAP was a great company to work for, and for anyone looking to work in enterprise software, I highly recommend them. But as much as I enjoyed working for them, I started to get the feeling that I wanted to do something new.Part of me always wanted to be involved in a startup. I’ve wanted to help build something. I’ve wanted to make an impact, and I’ve wanted to have that feeling of being depended on. This past summer, I felt it was as good a time as any to make the leap.If you want to know what a night and day switch feels like, By no means is 30 days enough time for me to know everything about working in a startup, and surely I have a lot to learn.Nonetheless, in my inaugural 30 days, here are some of the biggest things I’ve come to realize:Big companies are complicated, but startups are no exception. They encounter many similar problems, although at different scales. In a big company, it’s easy to attribute complexity to the size of an organization, overlap in teams, or handoffs in a process.When someone has a question, many times you don’t know who to ask for an answer. In a startup, there’s a similar problem — there’s probably Every company, big or small, must do the following: define product-market fit, figure out what customers are willing to pay, and create a team of great people to grow the business. Doing this with drastically fewer people is just as complicated as managing it at full scale.When I joined Chameleon, I expected to be working much longer hours, and that expectation certainly came to fruition. What I did not expect, however, the way in which I would become invested in my work.I feel a sense of emotional ownership with our company like I’ve never felt before. Not only do I care about Chameleon’s success; it’s like it’s becoming an important part of who I am.I’ve had to level up on my productivity hacks, and commit myself to a more regimented schedule. In doing so, I certainly have regained an appreciation for the Everyone in a startup — actually everyone — should build a network. Whatever your domain, it’s invaluable to have a group of people you can collaborate with, get feedback from, and discuss your interests with.Whether your goal is to identify a good job candidate, look for a group you can provide advice to, or get your newest blog post shared (*I don’t need to preach to all of you the value of networking, but hopefully we can all agree that your network should be meaningful and relevant.Unfortunately, the network I built in enterprise software doesn’t exactly translate to startup tech. Our interests are often different, and we can’t relate to each other as well. Since I made this change in my work, I’ve realized I really need to hustle to expand my network to startups, tech, and beyond.One of the best ways I’ve started to do this is by attending tech meetups in San Francisco. I decide which meetups to attend based on the content, the speakers, and the audience. The people who attend the meetups are just as an important factor as the people who are speaking. Most of these events have time allotted for networking, which shouldn’t be taken for granted.Some meetups I’ve enjoyed lately were put on by Bear with me while I make my point, but I never expected to feel the insecurities I’ve experienced since I started working at a startup. That’s not to say I’m not confident or good with my work, but learning new things and doing stuff you’ve never done before is naturally uncomfortable!I see this insecurity as something we should all seek out. You can be really good at doing the same thing for a long time, but you’ll never grow. There are a number of things I’m really good at, but for these new things, I have committed myself to This discomfort is exactly what I was looking for when I joined a startup. It’s akin to the discomfort you might feel when you eat spicy food — it’s hot, it’s uncomfortable, yet it’s exciting  you love it.When I joined Chameleon, there was no shortage of people that told me, “You’re going to learn so much! You’ll get to wear so many different hats.”I never realized just how rewarding it would be to be doing so many new things. In one day I might do content marketing, then do some legal work, and finish up by giving feedback on designs.I want to help a lot of people, and Chameleon has a product that offers that chance. It feels empowering to be a part of critical company decisions, and damn it, it feels good to take part in building something from the ground up.Whether you’re looking to make a similar transition, or you’re just plain trying to decide what your next career move should be, There are a lot of things I’ve come to realize in my first 30 days working at a startup, but probably the most important is that I’m really happy I made this decision.Product Hero Writing for Better User Onboarding

At multiple points in my life, I promised myself I would never join an early-stage startup again. I had had it. I was so sick of the media, high off the Facebook IPO, glorifying startup life. Today, entrepreneurship has been pigeon-holed into ponies and unicorns: that we all drank espressos, wore designer expedition gear, played foosball in-between meetings, ate gluten-free bread with globs of Since 2006, I have been on 12 startup teams. That’s a lot of bets and dashed dreams. Joining each new startup was my high. I’d come out of each team full of scars and burned bridges, but my addictions remained uncontrollable. While I was very fortunate in my career to have few licks of victory, they never came easy. I sacrificed everything to get to the next hit.The reality, my reality and for hundreds of other entrepreneurs and startup founders is we become slaves to our passion. Nothing about early-stage startups is glamorous, but the only saving grace is that glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel that For marketers at early-stage startups, we are usually the last one hired. When things go south, we are the first to get fired. It sucks. More than half the job is internally selling one’s skills and teaching the value of marketing. The remaining half is battling engineering and product for just a little bit of their time to deploy new business-driven features and marketing/advertising technology integrations to help drive the business forward — potentially exponentially.In the early 2000s, the Web 2.0 craze gave birth to a new class of startups that ultimately paved the way for brands to use social technology to reach consumers in a new, more meaningful way. For the first time ever, brands had massive followings on the Internet, where consumers spent copious amounts of time connecting, sharing and consuming media content and information with their personal online network. This drove brands scrambling to understand how to monetize this new channel of communication.As someone who helped build one of the first successful social media technology communities on top of MySpace and Facebook, I was also guilty of using technology to facilitate irrelevant, spammy marketing messages. While the advancement of modern technology has enabled marketers to achieve higher campaign conversion rates more than before, existing marketing frameworks and technology tools continue to spamAs social media technology startups matured, brands employed new marketing tactics that became increasingly invasive, rather than genuine. Infiltrating message boards and posting the same promotional message several times a day, everyday of the week. Sending multiple email blasts, that delivered marketing messages to an entire user base, regardless of user consent. Or continuously filling up a Facebook News Feed with the same advertising or marketing message from one brand. Even methods of testing for “winning” A/B, MVT campaigns, ultimately missed the mark by over 50%, sometimes more. But for marketers or growth hackers, 50% conversion is good. It was The tipping point in my career — and life — came a few years ago in my mid-twenties. I attended a lecture by Tim O’Reilly at New York University, on the birth of the Internet and his role in shaping today’s technology community. And one thing he said that I will never forget — “I built the first half of my career around early-stage B2C startups. And truth be told, growing audiences at B2C startups was tough. Accelerating growth from zero to millions of users is fucking hard. Without the resources and drive to win, it is virtually impossible. I did it three times, and I never want to do it again… ever. From that point, I made the conscious decision to switch my career to focus on B2B growth-stage startups in areas I was passionate about as a marketer: mobile, social, and advertising technology.We aimed to take mechanized, impersonal messages and use modern technology to humanize them in the form of conversations. After all, the beginning of a genuine, two-way relationship starts at a conversation.For the first time in my career, I had the opportunity to come onboard and create powerful marketing technology, that a non-technical marketer like me only dared to dream of. It was an opportunity of a lifetime. No more fighting with the engineering teams to integrate new marketing technology. Gone, was the need to hire a full team of people to analyze and granularly optimize each marketing campaign. And most importantly, no more spam. We used artificial intelligence to help mobile marketers humanize the app engagement experience. Our technology programmatically delivered behavior-based, two-way conversations that addressed each unique app user as a real, individual person. We coined it, the We knew about these challenges, and that they were surmountable. Funding was a factor that determined how quickly we could move to fill these gaps. So in true Lean fashion, we set goals in January to achieve our funding target by April 1st. As we moved along, we had our hits and misses, and the team was considerate enough to revise the timeline twice, to April 30th. As that day nears, we see that there is a sizeable gap in what we need and what we have committed. As heartbreaking as it is, we made a collective team decision to wind down the operations.There’s a Thai proverb that I live by, “The ability for marketers to use a single technology platform to automatically build, analyze and optimize an omnichannel strategy that humanizes digital engagement experiences, and addressing customers as real, individual people remains an enormous need to be fulfilled. A dream that is very much within reach. Hopefully, one day… a group of rambunctious kids will be annoyed enough of the problem to fix it.As human beings, we hold on to hope to light our path through dark times. For entrepreneurs, hope makes us persevere when all odds are against us — driving both bravado and delusion. However, no matter the delusion, or ridiculous an idea seems, I learned from experience that it is this hope we hold on to that motivates us to accomplish amazing things, large and small.This won’t be the last time you’ll hear from me. I will be back— soon. But for now, I’ll be patching up my broken heart with tubs of chocolate ice cream.Until next time…xoxo,-rI do marketing for startups, but I only write about myself.

Back in the spring, I digested a study entitled “It is difficult to disagree with the Idealab success criteria above. Interestingly, most of these factors are pliable, even changeable — you can pivot into a different business model, raise more capital, change out the team, or even wholly re-position your idea. But if you’re too early or too late, if the ‘dogs arent’ eating the dog food’, if your end users aren’t ready or there’s too much market noise — there’s not much you can do. Your timing is too far off, and you must make sincere strategic decisions. Hopefully, you discover the timing disconnect early on in the build out.But, there is also one critical missing piece in the Idealab study: A great startup culture endures the inevitable, often unseen ‘punch in the face’ like no other. The right startup culture brings out relationships that help endure the inevitable hardships in a fast growing business.When building the right startup culture, make a concerted effort to build on 1) strengths, 2) simplicity, 3) space, and 4) systems. If you get these right in the early days, you have a chance of being a contender, a chance of moving forward, a chance to go the distance so that, when all is said and done, you might have your hand raised in victory.

Four years back, I moved to Bengaluru to work for Flipkart. Since then I’ve had a love-hate relationship with Koramangala.One one hand, it was like being in a giant mela. There were food stalls everywhere and crowds mill about, all seemingly happy and hopping from offices to eateries and pubs. On the other hand the people seemed to live in bubble that stretched from Hosur road on one side to Bellandur lake on the other with no concept of life outside this bubble in rest of Bengaluru.Now, 4 years later, working for ChalkStreet, I am back right to the heart of this place. And, I have the following observations to make:If you hang around Koramangala long enough, you encounter an event that will scar you for life: The wait at Sony World signal. Its a strange black hole where time stands still and world stops moving. Getting past this gives most Koramangalites such a sense of universal accomplishment that they carry it around all day like a badge of honor. People from outside may often mistake this to a more general obnoxiousness. They are wrong.These days you spot these bikers in Koramangala. Based on their fancy full-body leather attire you‘d that they are planning to bike up the Himalayas but truly they are just trying to get to that 10 AM meeting at their office. If you see a guy on leather jacket riding a fancy bike in peak hour traffic, stay away — they usually have poor understanding of the concept of time, space and physics and tend to leave you in a spot of bother.Life in Koramangala is built up in blocks. 8 to be precise. Some blocks are popular and some are not. There is rampant block’ism. 4th block, being the numerical middle, has no special significance except having perhaps the hottest investor-startup exchange in all Bengaluru — the Costa Coffee on 80ft road.Koramangala is a place where dreams are built and destroyed in Cafes. It is littered with them. There is the more than usual smattering of CCDs, Costa Coffee and an occasion beleagured Barista. Then there are hundreds of one-off gourmet cafes. Some of them have a vagueQuiz Question: Why do Koramangalites drink so much coffee?Because, its what cool people do.Our hot startup-investor exchange, the Costa Coffee on 80ft road, can probably boast of being the smallest real-estate through which the maximum number of startup ideas get sounded. Sitting here is like scrolling through a ambiguous Quora feed. You hear a lot of voices with such authority that you’d be led to believe every one of them.Here, startups pitch to investors. Startups pitch to potential employees. Potential employees pitch to investors. Investors pitch to other investors. Even the guy at the counter pitches the new menu to you.So, if you have money and want to invest in a startup, just call me.Our startup, ChalkStreet, is located near Maharaja Signal. The stretch of the 80ft road in 4th block is divided into key-events called Sony world signal, Maharaja signal, Wipro signal, etc. Getting from one to the next is often celebrated with drinks at Prost (whenever you get there).Also, Heisenberg’s Uncertainty principle applies in this stretch when coordinating with a delivery boy.As is known, Koramangala is filled with Startups. But not all startups are the same — there are hierarchies. There is the baap-of-all which is Flipkart. It is like the Pole Star of this suburb. Get lost anywhere in Koramangala and you can use a Flipkart office to get back in the right direction. These offices serve as shrines for the thousands of other startups dreaming to similarly litter the area with their offices.Below is quite possibly a very common exchange in Koramangala:Then there are hundreds of other companies that, flush with funds, flush the funds in large offices, wall-art and foosball tables. Their employees are hot(as in driven) and the culture is cool. Its also an in-thing to swear a lot. And generally be seen as opinionated and ballsy. There is a whole sub-culture here that is fascinating and scary in equal proportions.is passe.is just stupid.Below these, there are startups who can afford a name board and some employees. This is where we fall. There are a gazillion of these in Koramangala. Name board printers are making a killing. Many of these are looking to progress to the next level. Some of them have stayed here for too long. Some, just continue to have the name boards for picking up old mail.The level below this is usually a couple of guys, a can of beer, good wifi and a dilapidated home. They pop in and out of existence at random and work on the next-big-idea. Sometimes, they materialize at the Costa Coffee on 80ft road.Startup naming is an art. Like in fart.Talking about Koramangala and not talking about food is like watching a Rajnikanth movie without hearing whistling. Food makes up for almost all of Koramangala’s fallacies. The good thing with drinking in Koramangala is that once drunk, its very easy to stumble semi-consciously into a place to eat.It is often difficult to build consensus within a team of 5 on where to eat. Conversations could go like this:This typically goes on for a while…In the end, people eat where they can find a place.And finally the most important part of the life in Koramangala. Life in a Startup. To be honest it varies quite a bit but there are some common themes:Yet, its all good.Koramangala is the proving ground for a startup ecosystem that can only do good for the young spilling out of our colleges in the millions. We still have a long way to go and there isn’t enough focus on innovation happening in traditional businesses but its a start. An experiment worth making. Meanwhile it makes sense to wall-off this strange universe between the clogged veins of Bengaluru’s large roads.And, if you are interested in working for This is a collections for articles about business including startups, business developments, and management.

Since Last year, we began an annual analysis of the top global startup ecosystems in the world, and To find this top 10, we looked at eight factors: Funding Ecosystem  Exits, Engineering Talent, Active Mentoring, Technical Infrastructure, Startup Culture, Legal  Policy Infrastructure, Economic Foundation, and Government Policies  Programs. We aren’t releasing the specific category scores until later this year since we are expanding this list to at least 20 cities. But for the first time we are revealing the cumulative scores (out of a total possible 80 points) with specific rankings.Of the eight factors we considered to reach these scores, some are “soft” factors that are difficult to quantify but that have real consequences. Trust and chemistry between members of a founding team, for example, is very difficult to quantify, and yet breakdown of trust and chemistry is the cause for at least a quarter of all startup failures.Probably the most important factor on this list is a soft factor — “active mentoring” or a This is also a reason why we focused on urban ecosystems and cities, not countries, because the startup cultures between two cities in the same country can be night and day.We included Legal  Policy Infrastructure as a factor because basic steps, such as company formation, can be a huge barrier to entrepreneurship. In Greece, the entry cost to form a company is 60,000 euros ($68,000)! How can this not be a factor that impacts the country’s economic health since it has policies that greatly hinder startup formation and eventually job creation and growth? I would rate Athens a “1” on a scale of one through 10.U.S. cities rated a 10 out of 10 on Legal  Policy Infrastructure because of the ease of creating a company and the generous bankruptcy laws that are cited as a driver for entrepreneurship.Seoul, South Korea rated 5 out of 10 since there are still laws that could hold a CEO personally liable if a company becomes bankrupt. There isn’t as clear of a separation between corporate liability and personal liability as in the U.S. We half jokingly commented to each other, while putting together the analysis, that if these laws were in the U.S., Silicon Valley might only have half the number of startups it currently does.For Government Policies  Programs, we gave London a 7 out of 10. The U.K. has programs to encourage angel investing, such as income tax relief of 30 percent for up to £1,000,000 per year (EIS program). In Seoul, our affiliated startup accelerator is part of a government matching program for venture capital funds where a $100,000 investment received a matching grant of $500,000. There are various other programs initiated by President Park’s “creative economy” initiative for South Korea, which is why we gave Seoul a 9 out of 10.With this updated analysis, we wanted to show how many “unicorns” there are in each of these global startup hubs. Any city that doesn’t have any unicorns would have a hard time breaking our top 10.This category’s ratings weren’t only about unicorns but also about the overall exit climate. What is the exit potential of a startup in that city? How many $50+ million exits did it see? How many $100+ million exits and $500+ million exits? Even though Tel Aviv (or even Israel overall) doesn’t have many unicorns (even historically and not just after our 2010 cutoff), it has had many exits over $100 million. We gave it 7 out of 10.Also this category is not just about exits but the overall funding ecosystem. There might be great base for seed-stage investment activity, but many cities in the world lack Series A funding to create a robust startup ecosystem.For this year’s analysis, we compared funding trends in North America, Asia, and Europe, and within U.S. metro areas. The overall venture capital activity at the top levels has been close between the U.S. and Asia, with Europe lagging behind.The three largest rounds of Q2 2015 in North America have been:The three largest rounds of Q2 2015 in Europe have been:The three largest rounds of Q2 2015 in Asia have been:Even with a market downturn, we are excited about the continuing innovation and startup activity across the globe. A sharp downturn will have a stronger effect on the weaker startup ecosystems and those overloaded on consumer facing products, but the stronger ecosystems we believe will continue to produce “unicorns” and successful companies.Partner 

These are amazing times for hardware startups. Companies such as Fitbit, NEST and Beats grew rapidly and went public or recently got acquired by established companies. Hardware startups are benefiting from the increasingly affordable and accessible resources and tools for financing, prototyping, manufacturing, online marketing and sales. This is great news but it doesn’t make “hardware the new software”. Here are some reasons why building a hardware startup is still very different from a software startup:There are dozens of articles and how-to’s on the Internet going into great detail about these challenges. I guess we read most of them before we decided to quit our jobs in 2014 and put our time and money into developing the world’s first smart design lamp. It has been an amazing roller coaster ride so far and we want to share our experiences and learnings, and the reasons why we still love developing a hardware product.Both founders of Luke Roberts are engineers with several years of working experience in management consulting and that helps a lot. We work together with large companies (production and app development), freelancers (product design) and interns (programming). The first lesson we learned: nobody does the thinking for you, not even parts of it. The founders must understand and take care of each and every element of the product they are developing, otherwise it gets really hard and expensive. Outsourcing parts of product development, like large companies do, is nearly impossible for startups because what we are doing has never (exactly) been done before and there is no standardized process for it.We are just a small fish for large companies and as we have only one shot we ask a lot of questions to understand every detail. This learning is very important, but sales representatives of large companies prefer easier customers with deeper pockets who can afford a budget overrun or a delay. For that reason it is really important to find the right partners that are interested in what you develop and motivated to help you succeed. Working with the best agency or company doesn’t help you if you are their least important customer.We all came across startup stories like “I had a problem, put a bunch of friends together, developed a first prototype over the weekend with an Arduino and now I am going into mass production.” Nothing is wrong with that, there are great products that are developed this way, especially on crowdfunding platforms. Our approach was different though. We think that if a solution is that easy to build and can be done with $1.000 and 48 hours of work, basically everyone can do it and there is no competitive advantage besides being the first mover. This is fine if you just want to develop a one-off product and don’t worry about competitive advantages or scaling a business. But if you want to establish a company that will grow over time, you better look for a strong market trend (in our case the ban on incandescents and the advent of smart products in our homes), find a weak spot of the current products (in our case the cumbersome remote controls for LED bulbs and poor “smartness”) and develop something that has never been done before (in our case a really smart design lamp).We realized that we are heading in the right direction when we started to talk to production companies and experienced engineers, and all of them told us that they have never done something like that before, but that they really like the product and our approach seems reasonable.We have worked in academia, large companies and management consulting before founding our hardware startup and the learning curve has never been as steep as it is right now. The beauty (and challenge) of consumer hardware products is that the development involves people from very diverse backgrounds and subject areas. Developing hardware means ensuring that all the different teams deliver their part of the final product at one point in time in the quality and quantity that you need — and there are always “good” reasons for delays.Compared to a “normal” job, you are responsible and accountable for everything from day one. There is nobody else (your co-founders aside) that feels the urgent need to ensure the success of your product.Only now, we start to understand why the products around us look the way they do and what degree of complexity companies like Apple are mastering. One more hint: Never ask a manufacturer to produce something in “Apple quality”, it is just not affordable for a start-up to live up to these standards and it makes you look uninformed.We hope to see many more hardware startups in the near future and wish you all the best if you are already working on something.

This fifth episode of In this episode he explains why startups should invest more in emails and photography, how to best partner with a creative firm, and why you shouldn’t be afraid to “outsource” your brand.Don’t have time for a podcast? You’re in luck! We have also prepared a transcript with links, highlights, and other audiovisual elements for easy skimming  sharing.Hi. I’m We’re going to talk to JB today about how to think about branding in the early days of your startup, how to tell the difference between premier designers and the rest of the guys and how to make an object as mundane as a mattress, a must own object for millennials.That being thinking about how the brand comes to life in the world across digital experiences, physical experiences, marketing content activation. Something that I think about a lot is the word “agency.” It’s a really tricky word. It comes with a lot of baggage. I think people especially founders and investors as well tend to have a mentality that agency is a dirty word like you don’t want to work with agencies like they are going to try to screw you over, they are going to try to make money off of you, they are not going to do something in your best interest.That’s something that I think we’ve tried to figure out how to navigate away from that and not be an agency but really be a partner with the companies we work with which might sound a little like BS. I think we try to actually live it and remove some of the objectives and agendas that are inherent for creative businesses in the creative industry awards thinking about industry acclaim and recognition and the world of pitching and all of that. We try not to play that game.If you think about a founding team most cases you’re getting two, three, four more people coming together who haven’t done something together before. They all had their unique perspectives but you have to figure out how to get them on one page going in one direction together as a team. A lot of what we wind up doing is like therapy sessions. It’s like trying to help people to get comfortable and understand each other’s perspectives and align our vision for a brand and experience and a story.At that stage that’s really the challenge that companies are facing and that we’re facing in working with them but it’s incredibly fun because you’re trying to make something new and successful out of thin air. When you’re working with a company that’s later stage it’s different challenges. I think there you wind up facing operational challenges and politics in terms of different teams have been build and you’re starting to have different priorities. The product team needs this, the marketing needs that, the founders are thinking this, then you got tech realities.Figuring out how to successfully build the right brand, create the right experience, navigating different priorities within the company and you’re also faced with the challenge of attachment. Just the emotions of the thing that someone has created and quite frequently people know that it’s not right but it’s very hard for them to understand how far away from it they should move. We have to help them work through a process to imagine the possibilities and to see where things could go to get to that better, stronger place.I think something we take really seriously is if we’re going to engage to the company we want to do what’s in their best interest that’s going to actually work not the thing that’s going to make us money. We’re always starting by figuring out, “Okay, how do we approach this? What is this ultimately going to roll out to in terms of the customer experience, the marketing experience, sales experience,” making sure there’s a plan to get from the beginning to the end not that we map all of that out but making sure that we’re on the same page of what it’s going to take to get there.Then, once we’ve figured out the process and approach and figure out a proposal of what’s the time it’s going to take, what’s the cost it’s going to take and then figure out a relationship structure from there.They are ahead of the game on everything they are doing and I think that’s the piece that that’s what builds to create the brand experience. They are doing all of those things really well and it’s incredibly hard to do that. We see all the time companies are doing a couple of the things well but those things that you missed could be the really critical things so whether that’s emails you’re sending out. So many startup struggle with sending great email marketing, whether it’s transactional emails, marketing emails, promotional emails, that’s a channel where you’re having a direct conversation with someone.I can’t tell you the number of times whether it’s companies we worked with or companies we haven’t and they send out emails you’re just like, “What is this?” People overlook it because they don’t think it’s, “Oh, it’s just email. Whatever, no big deal.”What I think is really interesting about Airbnb as a case study is that they know they stand for something bigger than renting rooms or renting an apartment or house. They know that they stand for community and experiences and shared experience. That’s something that’s so powerful and mean something to their users and VRBO was around for a really long time but no one is talking about them. I think that’s because they are a functional platform and product but they are not a brand. Airbnb built a brand.If you’re talking about something that is more technical. If it’s a piece of technology, software application and you’re not exactly sure who the customer is, you need to try it out and see where it’s going to fit and where you’re going to see traction then it’s probably too early. I think we see companies that are two, four people and an idea pre-funding, raising a seed round and that’s the perfect time to build a brand. Then we see companies where the right time might be after a seed round, after they’ve been out and doing a beta test for six months and like, “You know what? It’s time to double down.”I think that the short way to think about it is like when are you ready to double down because building a brand and doing it at the right way is making an investment and it’s making a bet and it’s doing something that you want to last and help to build your business. If you’re not comfortable and confident enough to do that then you’re not ready to do it.Within that spectrum things are constantly changing. The product, features, messaging, you’re testing different targets. I think we try to build brands that span across all of that and create an umbrella that you can evolve and grow into knowing that things are going to be changing. Sometimes things step beyond and you say, “You know what? Okay, this is far enough that we’ve got to take a step back and reimagine it.” I think part of our responsibility is making sure that we’re thinking enough about where things could go to create something that gives you that flexibility.Our reaction was the thing that you think you need which is probably like findadoctor.com is completely forgettable and you’re going to have to spend so much more money and effort to get people to remember it and care about it. Where ZocDoc is short, it’s memorable, it’s actually doing a lot of hard work and you should just go with it. Yeah, it would have been great to make some money and do a project. Our feeling was that that would have been doing a disservice to the business because they actually had a great name.Equity can be useful as a way to affect timing of when you’re paying for things, how much cash you have to spend to get something done and doing the right version of it versus the version you can afford. I think it can be really useful in that sense. From my perspective I actually think the more interesting part of it is about relationship and doing what we do with companies is incredibly hard, it’s emotional, it’s a difficult, messy, creative process. If you can structure a relationship where you truly feel that everyone is running towards the same goal, that’s a powerful thing.It facilitates hard conversations and it make sure that you’re doing the right thing and not just the easy thing. Across the board I think you’ve got to make sure that you’re doing it at the right time with the right people for the right reasons. I wouldn’t run around throwing equity to everyone.They start telling you about features and it’s not about features, it’s got to be about something that is bigger and ladders up to emotions so that people feel something versus you just telling them a functional story. I think understanding that and making sure that you give it the proper amount of your attention as a founder, it’s got to be something that you’re invested in personally in terms of your time and emotion.Because you want to create something that you can be excited about and embody and will build your teams culture, it will help with recruiting, it will help with fund raising, press, everything you’re going to have to do. Giving it the right attention and the right time, the right amount of money.Then people react and say, “Yeah, that’s it, that’s what we’re trying to do,” and then we bring that to life. If founders don’t have a vision of what they’re trying to create, we can’t do what we do. Something that I’ve come across, it’s interesting and more on the West Coast than … More on the San Francisco, Silicon Valley, seeing this idea that for brand to be authentic you have to create it yourself. This idea of, “Well, we need to build it within the company and we’ve got designers so we can do it.” From my perspective working with us isn’t outsourcing the problem, right?It’s not about, “Well, we’re going to just have these guys tell us what our brand is.” What we’re bringing to the table is that we do it day in and day out and we have a process to get from point A to point B and know that you’re going to have the thing that represents who you are. The process is incredibly important and also I think the ability to have the perspective and the strategic insight to find that thread across all the things that are important and interesting about a business and its product and its team and its culture.I think a piece that is really critical and … I’ll use an example Warby Parker, I think it’s a brand that especially in the startup seeing a lot of people respect, they’ve been incredibly successful and when I look at that business and why they’re succeeding there’s a lot of reasons. I think a really big one is the level of execution, they’re executing really well across everything they’re doing. From day one their photography has been incredible, they’ve partnered with the right people to help them do that and they understand that the quality of the content is a direct expression of their brand and their product and the experience. Just because you’re launching something direct to consumer and you’re using the internet doesn’t mean that you don’t also need great assets and great content.More generally in terms of what company should expect to spend on creative services, I see ads on Facebook all the time for a logo for $5, you’ve got that under the spectrum and you’ve got big global consultancies charge millions of dollars. There are very few things in the world where there’s that broad of a spectrum from something that seems like relatively the same.You need to surprise people, you need to pull them in, you need to give them a reason to give you the time of day. There’s so many new things out there and that’s why I think there’s an interesting moment in time to be talking about brand because there’s … We’re joking about this earlier, right, there’s so many funds, there’s so much capital out there, there’s so many founders, like entrepreneur is the new rock stars. Kids are growing up wanting to be Mark Zuckerberg not whoever they wanted to be before.That means there’s more companies launching, there’s more apps, there’s more websites, there’s more products. At any given time there’s three or four or five people doing something that at least looks to be the same thing and in that moment you need to be the one who realizes that building a brand and telling a story and creating a conversation is the thing that can really differentiate you and catapult you to be the leader in that space.There’s a lot of things about that story that made it all click. I don’t personally think of Facebook as a brand, I think of it as a platform, a product and I think people sort of probably think of it more as utility and kind of a thing that they just use versus the thing that they have an emotional connection with on a brand level. I think it was possible to launch that way and create a product first approach at that moment and time, I think that’s much harder to do today.You look at a product like Medium, Medium to me is really interesting because I think there’s a very brand lead approach to have the experience and the design and the aesthetic and what it stands for. That’s very different than something like a Tumblr where they launched it was like, “Well, this is a unique platform, a unique product experience and that’s the thing that really lead,” tech lead versus brand.I think if there’s a reason to change and you can create something that brings people on that journey and shows them where you’re going, it can build excitement and spark a dialog and a conversation. I was talking to someone at one point about a really large global business, a traditional corporate consulting company that launched a rebrand that they invested millions and millions and millions of dollars in and sort of like, “Why did you do it?” A really interesting reason was like, “We wanted to spark a conversation with our customers. We wanted to get people to be curious like, why did you do that.”There’s a reason to talk about change and sometimes that’s a good reason to think about brand. That’s I think when you’re at a scale that you’re no longer a startup, that’s sort of like you’re a big corporation and brand takes on a different type of meaning and what it means to the business and your customers and culture and all that. On a Facebook front they’ve been doing pretty well so all right.Did JB get you thinking about design in new ways?

Avoiding the endless loop and the illusion of progress.The title surely sounds weird, especially coming from a founder of a To make few things clear. The start-up world is quite different on this side of the pond. With that in mind, some things may not translate for you readers from other continents.A combination of factors has created (or is still creating) a booming start-up industry around here. And by industry I mean bunch of advisers, mentors, consulting companies, accelerators, and people that just like to hang around. Among the leading causes for this is the All this money is attracting people trying to get their share. Which means you suddenly get a lot (and I mean A LOT) of co-workings, conferences, meet-ups and similar activity all over Europe. Events where semi-launched products are being pitched as the hottest thing and where “experts” offer their freshly googled opinions on all things start-up.I know, it all sounds very Silicon Valley, but the hard reality is, it isn’t. Smart money is really hard to find, there’s no single market to attack and grow fast, even the press coverage is limited. And in the end, you’re just pitching your idea to the same people all over again. People who are neither your customers nor your investors. But they will gladly give advice. And take your money.Let’s start in the beginning. So you get your own unique and brilliant idea, whatever that might be, discuss with some friends and decide to throw the safe future out the window to pursue the start-up dream.The obvious place to visit first is your local co-working, or perhaps a weekly start-up meet-up. Where you get to know the people, do some market research (or at least that’s what you think you’re doing) and generally have a great time mingling with the awesome crowd of like-minded youth.Skip ahead to few months later, you’ve now perfected your pitch, found the team and are ready to go on pitching events. There’s no shortage of those either nowadays. It’s probably your first contact with investors and judging panel. And you probably did worse than you expected. But that’s ok, because there’s plenty of chances to try again.Right around here is where it gets tricky. To really achieve something, you should focus on the users, getting the product-market fit, testing, talking to customers (you know, the people prepared to give you money). But instead the flashy start-up world gets so many founders caught up in the illusion of progress. Going from conference to conference, from pitch to pitch, isn’t progress. It’s wasted time. Time you should be spending talking to users. Time you should be spending improving your product or service. Time you should be looking for money.If you find yourself wandering from one event to the other, stop (unless you’re making money organising these events or talking at them, in that case, good job).The hard truth is, you will not find the solution for your business there. Those who have it, are working on it, while you’re mostly wasting time.Maybe, you’ll miss out on meeting some great person. Perhaps you’ll even pass on some minor investment opportunity. But you might get something much more valuable. Paying customers.Best money is the one earned on the market. It’s also the cheapest money. After you’ve visited your fair share of events, met everyone there is to meet, take a pause from it. Focus on your product, your team, your users. Try and build a business. As Arthur nicely put it, After you’ve done that, you can always go back to those events. This time they’ll even invite you. Perhaps as a speaker. Because you know, there’s not really that many companies that actually managed to transition from start-up to profitable business.In the end, the path to success comes down to two things:Bonus advice: Don’t take advice from people who haven’t built their own company before. Their knowledge only comes from books. Old books.Currently mostly doing CEO-ish stuff at 

As a founder I can say that everyone in a startup has to pull his or her weight as The majority of successful startups look for really smart people as well as people that are a great culture fit.For me, the lack of applicants doing this is by far one of the most perplexing things I come across when reviewing applications.But as a bare minimum you In addition to this you could write blog posts on medium or your own personal blog about your thoughts on marketing and possibly your own experiences, if you have had a marketing role before. Or you could seek out people with an existing project and offer to do the marketing for that project, this project could be open source have a look at Github for a project that catches your interest.Show that you’re passionate about the startup you’re applying to, applies throughout the whole application process but it usually starts with your cover letter (if you’re required to write one). If you’re asked to write a cover letter, make the effort to find out the name of the person you’re applying to (to whom it may concern or dear sir or madam aren’t the best first impressions). These days it’s easy to find people, generally Twitter and LinkedIn are the best places to find out who you should address your enquiry to.As for the content of your cover letter mention why you want to join the company you are applying for and that you use them (if you have an account with their product and you include your account name [depending on the product]). Do your research on the founder and try and find out the startups core values and describe how you fit in with their core values giving specific examples.In both your covering letter and CV or application form, you really have to make the most impact in the shortest amount of time, as there are hundreds or thousands of other applicants that startups have to review. We can generally gain a sense of whether we should continue reading an application after the first few seconds, so you do not have long to get your point across.Just be concise and specific and avoid jargon and buzzwords (that is definitely a big no no).You don’t need to include every previous role you’ve ever done. My advice is if it’s not relevant don’t include it because irrelevant experience is worse than no experience.To any startup worth joining, speed is an invaluable asset and demonstrating that you can keep up and even excel in a fast paced environment is very important.If you’ve worked in a startup before then that’s a great indicator that you can deal with the fast paced nature of startups and a great reference will help your case.If you haven’t worked in a startup before (even if you have) you should always try and respond to all correspondence quickly (this also shows that you are passionate) including but not limited to any technical tasks that you may have been assigned.“So why did you decide to apply for the role?” “mmm I needed a job/internship and this looked good” you may as well end the interview at that point. Startups need people that believe in their mission and you will only know what a startup believes when you There are a lot of subtle reasons, which could lead to your CV entering the trashcan and a lot of them are pretty basic so lets see if we can address all of them.Don’t be lazy and send us an attachment of your resume (CV) whilst leaving the email blank. This roughly translates to “I don’t care”, which is fair enough but then we equally will not care about your application.Most lies are pretty easy to expose and it is both embarrassing for you and a waste of time for us so I would strongly recommend that you don’t do it. When we ask about your experience or projects that you have worked on and we hear a lot of excuses or obvious dodging of the question, that instantly raises a red flag. We understand that you may need to compete with other people and feel as though this would be your competitive advantage but it will do more harm in the long term.Startups are not naïve and realize that candidates will always exaggerate the truth to try further themselves but I say try not to do it.We love persistent applicants because they are passionate and they will not stop at anything to be selected, which is usually a great indicator that the candidate will work really hard at our startup. If you get rejected see if you can get some feedback as to why you were not selected and then use that feedback to help you reapply at some point in the future.Founder of A collection of posts from the team at  PinU.

There is greater potential than ever before to serve the underserved in society. But striking the balance between social impact and profit is no easy matter — until now.It will take place at the intersection of start-ups, government, and impact investing, under an innovative revenue model known as pay-for-success.A pay-for-success bond is a contract with government to pay for a company’s product or service if it achieves target metrics of social change. Meeting those metrics will save the government millions of dollars, since they won’t need to spend on social programs that address the same issues. Those savings then convert into The U.S. government spends $700 billion annually on social programs. With that much money on the table, there must be better solutions, and plenty of opportunity for savings (and profit). Compare this to the The current model isn’t working. Funding to programs are allocated based on the number of people served, not effectiveness. We need evidence based initiatives. Pay-for-success offers this, and brings government to the table as a paying customer.This is incredibly exciting because it gives entrepreneurs opportunity to go after new markets they otherwise would have overlooked.Shlomy Kattan, Senior Director of the Barbara Bush Foundation Adult Literacy XPRIZE says in his article:XPRIZE teams and other start-ups should consider pay-for-success as an option for sustainably growing their businesses. The government is already a stakeholder in this problem. The Quantifying “metrics of social change” for adult literacy apps would be easy with a written test, be cheaper than current brick-and-mortar solutions operated by non-profits, and scale faster due to accessibility.Imagine how many more opportunities like this might exist if we just looked for them, knowing pay-for-success is an option.Investors provide seed funding once the bond is in place. Depending on the scope of the project, the company has anywhere from a few months to a few years to achieve meaningful results. A neutral third party evaluates the company’s product/service, typically by comparing to a control group. If the company is proven successful, the government pays, and investors get their return. If the company fails, investors lose their money and no tax payer dollars are lost.Pay-for-success started in 2010, in the UK. A few states in the U.S. were inspired by their success, and in 2012 began piloting programs. Bonds range from:In early 2015, an act was proposed to allocated federal funding to pilot pay-for-success. It is called the These are incredibly exciting first steps toward sustainable change, and new entrepreneurial opportunities.Imagine a world in which exists companies and ambitious startups no longer focused on profit, leaving people and planet as a secondary consideration. Instead, the new currency is pure, unadulterated impact.If we support this mechanism, we can begin to act.

This past summer I worked for I was one of the 17 interns at the company and the experience was extraordinary. With that in mind, the best advice from my 12 week internship is that everyone should work at a startup at least once in their lives. It’s really incredible, and here’s why…At most large companies, the CEO is someone you see give speeches on a web cast or interviews with reporters on TV. Rarely do you see them in person, and even if you wanted to chat with them, there’s no time in their schedule to do so.That’s not how Tumblr, or any startup for that matter, operates.Most companies have a very strict communication hierarchy, but at a startup your voice matters and your opinions will be heard, sometimes even by the person who makes the most important decisions.The startup culture blends the boundaries of work and life when it comes to the office space, but it’s doing so in a way that makes employees want to voluntarily stay at work longer.At Tumblr, we received catered meals every day, had a plethora selection of quick snacks, and dinner was paid for if an employee had to stay late.The office is decorated with beautiful art, conference rooms were designed for comfort, and the open floor plan allowed for people to get work done, without being confined to the old-school cubical. It’s a refreshing change from typical corporate America, and once you work at an office like Tumblr’s, a typical corporate office becomes foreign and rudimentary.There are work friends and there are outside of work friends, but as a result of the incredible environment that a startup creates, combined with the like-minded driven people who work there, these two groups slowly merge into one.From celebrating people’s 21st birthdays together, having company yacht outings, and all while sharing similar interests, these groups merge and the people who you work with five days a week, slowly become night and weekend friends as well.At Tumblr it truly felt like a life long family, one unit, that were trying to make things better for everyone.Naturally, being in a startup, you are exploring and competing in uncharted territories at the intersection of business, technology, and culture, which leads to things occasionally not going your way.Especially as an engineer, sometimes certain pieces of code slip through the cracks of review and lead users to being slightly confused as to why they were auto-magically logged out.Keep in mind that these minor stressful times come with an enormous reward; you and your team are pushing the boundaries of technology and building something new. Wether it be organizing company events, designing marketing material, or building a product for a startup, you are doing things that have never been done before.The most fascinating piece of a startup is it’s scale, for example at Tumblr there are 450 million users, and just 300 incredible employees.Depending on how you look at it, one person is responsible for 1.5 million people and if you put that into a different perspective, that is the population of the city I’m not saying the math is accurate in terms of one’s direct responsibility, but startups usually keep things lean and concentrated, but have a large base of customers and users.If you work at startup, you’ll find yourself managing, building, or designing things that millions of people interact with daily, as opposed to most companies where you just become another small cog in the machine.If you’re interested in my experience at Tumblr or just want to chat about technology, feel free to reach out to me on my website Developer, Designer and Entrepreneur.

Unlike social networking sites Facebook and Twitter, Snapchat is still a fairly new addition to the ever growing list of networking platforms. With funding over $1.2, over 100 million users and 350 million snaps a DAY, it’s no surprise that snapchat is quickly being used as a new platform of choice for brands as a marketing channel to connect with their target audiences. Users demand visual content.As you can see above, the number of Snapchat users is rising day by day and business ventures like You can use Snapchat to demonstrate your product by sending striking images that will catch viewers attention and have a persuasive appeal for your product. Snapchat can create a story about your product. One big reason behind Taco Bells snapchat marketing success is that they took into account the demographic of snapchat’s users.They were able very to craft their message keeping in mind the language of the main users using the platform (45% 18–24 and 26% 25–34). They used emojis and craft their storytelling in relation to advertising their products towards the desired target market.As long as you present yourself getting aligned with the trend of the platform without seeming too desperate and adhesive, users will not really mind to get engaged with your brand.One aspect of Snapchat is that, the images and messages shared have an expire period after which messages get disappeared. The powerful feature of only 1–10 seconds per photo or video, and the very powerful ‘story feature’, taps into the psychology of snapchat’s primary users ability to feel connected and remember a brand. In particular, the story feature can is perfect for sending out exclusive offers. You can send images describing a certain offer and set up a specific expire period and set up a deal that will require the users to show the image before it expires. For companies that have an e-commerce or have a physical store presence, this can be a great way to launch exclusive deals and engage customers.Just recently, The platform can be a useful one to build a loyal follower base to keep them engaged about your recent promotions and deals. So, if you are looking to build a wider network outside other social networking platforms, Snapchat is unique and a good place to start up for visual content. Visual content can be more challenging to strategise then using your mainstream channels such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, but if you are creative enough, you will have your followers raving for more and spreading the love of your brand.McDonald’s did a creative campaign with their followers with none other than the king, Lebron James. The brand has snapped out pics of LeBron and behind-the-scenes commercial footage with other athletes like NFLers Richard Sherman and Johnny Manziel, as well as creative food snaps and contests.One great way to get engaged with your customers and attain their loyalty is to provide instant customer support. A customer can snap you a photo of your product seeking support for a specific issue. In turn, you can snap them back with the answer they are looking for.Suppose, a customer may send a snap of your product still in its packaging and may face trouble to unpack. You can send video message showing ways to unpack it. You can interact with your customers in many possible ways depending on their need and situation.Snapchat is a platform to have fun while connecting with people. If you intend to engage your business or startup with it, you will have to align yourself with the same spirit. Rather than providing some grave advertisements, you have to make the Snapchat experience that your customers feel a sense of real fun and emotional understanding of your brand.One way to do this is to use your Snapchat account to show users things they normally wouldn’t see on other social networks or through most marketing campaigns.The NBA did an exclusive behind the scenes snapchat story with, Kevin Durant’s Most Valuable Player award just over a year ago. In a three photo story, the NBA created a story to encourage fans to tune in on real time on NBATV.com and NBA.com as Kevin accepted the award.If you start using Snapchat now and build a strong network, you will be miles ahead by the time your other competitors will start using it and start to learn how to use it for marketing purposes. By then, you will start to harness new features of the network. Snapchat has a user base in the 100 millions and is a platform that has viable potential that should not be overlooked for your business or startup. Get creative!Acura started its adventures in Snapchat by sending its first 100 followers teaser footage of its NSX prototype in action.Snapchat marketing is not for everyone. As previously stated, approximately 45% of the primary users of the platform are aged between 18 and 24. So, if your business caters to the young generation, then snapchat can be a powerful marketing channel for you. You can share product previews, offer discounts and share stories of your product. Facebook was viewed as a platform to catch the younger generation but with the emergence of other networking platforms like Snapchat, it is no longer the case. If your target segment doesn’t target users within the age brackets of 18–34, then snapchat won’t be the right channel for you.I would love to hear your comments below about snapchat, how it can help businesses and share your stories about how Snapchat has helped your business.Entrepreneur.

We To find out, I selected 21 pre-exit companies from 7 accelerators , and 21 companies created by venture builders. I did my best to select the best and biggest from each pool. Then I looked at data in CrunchBase, MatterMark, Linkedin and did some excel magic.Here’s the list of accelerator companies:And the list of startup studio companies:When it comes to measuring startups, one of the most important (at least talked about) metric is total funding. So let’s see, how these companies do…There’s little surprise here. YC and Rocket companies occupy 6 places in the top 10.Also as you can see, companies from top accelerators raised 105% more than studio companies.It’s also worth to note how many people these companies employ.In this category, the differences are more subtle. Companies from accelerators employ 17% more people than studio companies.When it comes to growth, comparing different companies is a big challenge. To tackle this, I looked at the MatterMark growth score. It tracks multiple signals (web traffic, inbound links, social network interactions…) on a weekly basis. The higher the better.This chart is intriguing. Especially if you cross check the results with the funding data.It seems, that companies created by startup studios can achieve higher growth score from the same amount of money, compared to companies from accelerators.If true, this could be proof that:Please keep in mind, that the above comparison has some limitations:I somehow hope that someone will be deeply unsatisfied with my comparison, and will spend time on a analyzing a much wider data set. If you do, please let me know, I’d be happy to read it. :)I’ll collect some data on exits, to make a similar comparison. Although I’m not yet sure whre I will find valid information on valuation and acquisition deal size.Also I’m working on part 2 of my startup studio related Unfortunately since weeks I had zero luck reaching the following studios, getting response from them: If you have any connections there, and could connect me to someone on the inside, that would be a big help. I mean Thanks!Entrepreneur, CEO of Firmpalace.com, startup studio pundit

Nowadays we can see an increase of startups, it’s as if everyday there is a new idea waiting to become a project. This is definitely true but what is the backbone of a startup? Is it the team? The idea? Or is something else way more important?An idea is only that until someone is willing to put it on paper and start to develop it, that´s a startup. I have always thought that the moment you think about doing something new, a clock starts running with a limited time to carry it out. This is why we see apps, sites, stores, clothes, etc with a similar or even the identical approach launching within a few months, days or even hours!Once you decide that your idea is worth taking some time or even all your time to do it, it’s time to find a good team that will also fall in love with it. There is no secret number to put together a team it’s like everything else in life, it’s about quality not quantity. An important thing to remember is that you are the owner of the idea and that’s why at the beginning everyone is going to ask you about every detail, in time a balance will be reached.A good example of having a great startup was Myspace that became at one point the number one social network used. The idea of meeting new people and sharing music was something so revolutionary that everyone was addicted to it. Another one was Hi5 founded the same year 2003 and fought to become number one for several years.Another social network that understood the needs and more importantly how to develop and sell was Facebook. Anyone who has read about this company or even seen the movie (whether everything happened like that or not) knows that they as a startup thought up a really ingenious way to attack their target market. For them to be unique was its distinctive feature that catapulted it from a simple idea into a billion dollar idea, which today controls the market.But one thing that is more important to have, can be resumed in one word “Marketing”. I’m not talking about launching a promo on tv or an ad through internet, I’m talking about knowing your target market where your idea is going to be developed and grow, the place where your idea is visualized to satisfy a need, basically where your idea is going to bring you revenue.Surely a lot of people are going to discourage you or will even tell you that no one will use or understand what are you trying to do. There are always people like that. Like Steve Kalanick, the co-founder of Uber, said “Fear is the disease. Hustle is the antidote”. The backbone of a startup is nothing else than To Believe. Believe in the idea, Believe in the team, Believe in yourself and do it.Simon.Sharing my views on Usability and User Experience 

Increasingly, I’m seeing that the best entrepreneurs are not recently post-college, but seasoned founders — many in their late 20s and 30s, and with growing families (the founders of Without balance and structure, they’ll hit burnout quickly, create a chaotic home environment, and contribute to the It’s not so much the time you spend On the other hand, if you’re crashing in front of a Netflix binge every night, it’s time to reexamine your commitment to doing and being something great.Through The Startup Family column on Launch/DFW, my wife has been uncovering the stories of how families survive high risk, high intensity ventures.

Just as investors fire a long list of questions at startup teams (do they ever stop asking questions), VCs have the benefit of being able to invest in numerous teams and themes, and thus diversify their capital such that failures don’t make or break their entire portfolio (side note: I’m starting a campaign to ban the word “portfolio” who’s in). Founders, on the other hand, are concentrating much of their personal capital into one asset: their startup. They can have much more to lose (but also more to gain).Founders may have checked off everything on their investor diligence list (meetings, phone calls, prior personal and firm investments, industry expertise, fit with team and firm, blog, Twitter feed, LinkedIn resume, etc.) but if they miss doing the reference check, they may end up with less than advertised. (I am focusing here directly on the partner of a firm not the firm’s reputation, as the partner with whom you will be working is more important than the firm.)Teams should first try to connect with as many investor references as possible before going to the investor. Scour an investor’s investments and connections to find people who know and have worked with him or her. Many times (hopefully) a startup will know many of these people, and if not, this may speak more to a founder’s lack of network than the investor’s.If I were a founder, and 1. Founder of company where investor participated and outcome was complete 2. Founder of company where investor participated and outcome was complete 3. Founder of company where investor participated on the board (probably led the round as well so can understand that process as well).Overkill? Nope — thoroughness. Notes on Changing the World

In this article I want to bust a couple of myths. I’ll let you in on the first one now: Now, I know what you’re thinking. It’s naïve to assume that just throwing money at a business will make it grow, but it’s an idea I see being marketed more and more, especially to young entrepreneurs and small business owners. Not always explicitly, but the message is implied. Of course money matters, but knowledge, networks and mentorship are just as important. Furthermore, possession of one source of capital doesn’t necessarily lead to the other — getting investment won’t necessarily grow your network as an entrepreneur or bridge your skill gaps.The way the story goes is that financial capital is the most important capital for success as an entrepreneur. A recent advert from Start Up Loans echoes this story; it implores the budding entrepreneur to take out a Start Up Loan, use their bedroom as an office (‘the beauty of the commute!’) and start a company. On the surface this seems like a relatively innocuous proposal (a lot of amazing things started in the bedrooms of entrepreneurs, right?), but in reality I think it’s a recipe for isolation.The bedroom approach is great if you are supremely lucky and have a team who are willing and able to work from your house, or if you are an established entrepreneur with investor connections and business experience. However — the more likely story if you are taking out a Start Up Loan — is that you are a new entrepreneur who would benefit from being in a structured environment with access to mentorship, feedback and resources. I fear that telling young entrepreneurs to take out loans and isolate themselves until they get their business off the ground is misleading, even counterproductive.Putting all the emphasis on finance detracts from the importance of social and intellectual capital. Of course, it depends on the entrepreneur and the business, but sometimes it is better to develop the other sources of capital before looking at finance (plus, raising social capital doesn’t tend to cost you equity).The importance of mentorship to entrepreneurs cannot be overstated; good mentoring really enhances social and intellectual capital. Start Up Loans offer a mentoring programme, but from both my own experience and speaking to others, it needs a little work. Entrepreneurship is not a rigid science, and rejecting the myth that finance is the only important source of capital to an entrepreneur is a good start to looking at the issue more holistically. Entrepreneurs need skills, networks, relationships and mentorship just as much as they need cash.Free  heavily subsidised workspace, mentoring and access to finance for pre-start and early stage businesses.

Vous direz qu’à première vue ces deux commerces n’ont rien en commun. L’un évolue dans un environnement technologique foisonnant et vise à créer un nouveau produit, souvent rempli d’incertitudes. L’autre est une structure qui existe depuis des siècles et qui dispose d’un modèle économique stable et approuvé. Pourtant, si l’on s’y intéresse de plus près, des parallèles sont indéniables !Pour les startups , tout comme les restaurants, l’image est une vitrine indispensable. Elle est un point clé dans la réussite de ces institutions : elle est aussi bien utile pour attirer des clients, des investisseurs ou encore des salariés. Celle-ci doit correspondre à l’identité de l’entreprise, mais aussi à ce que les clients ont envie de voir ou envie d’appartenir.Plus concrètement, Le Nous pouvons d’ailleurs constater qu’elle se voit souvent amplifiée dans les milieux de la restauration et des startups, notamment via la publicité et les médias.Cette façade se révèle surtout importante à leurs débuts. N’ayant pas encore acquis une légitimité sur leur marché, c’est généralement un des principaux moyens, pour ces entreprises, d’attirer les nouveaux clients. De plus, de nombreux médias véhiculent cette image sans même avoir testé le produit ou rencontré les personnes qui l’ont créé. Si l’image est bien maîtrisée, elle peut être un facteur clé de succès.Cependant, cette dernière est loin de refléter la réalité de l’activité de ces entreprises. Un restaurant qui propose des plats français “faits maison”, un autre qui se targue d’avoir gagné de nombreuses distinctions, une startup qui déclare avoir développé un algorithme révolutionnaire ou encore avoir en quelques semaines des milliers d’utilisateurs… Ces annonces participent à la construction de leur image, mais lorsqu’on connaît la réalité des faits, on s’aperçoit rapidement que les solutions sont souvent « bricolées ». Le fameux algorithme est finalement géré à la main par plusieurs stagiaires, les plats français faits maison sont réchauffés par des cuisiniers n’ayant aucune notion en gastronomie française. Ces informations sont difficilement vérifiables si l’on n’est pas expert, mais au final peu importe si l’utilisateur est satisfait du service ou du produit qu’il a payé.Aussi séduisant qu’ils soient, ces deux environnements sont aussi synonymes de précarité de l’emploi. Les entrepreneurs qui se lancent dans ces aventures ont bien souvent besoin d’une main-d’oeuvre plus ou moins qualifié, mais surtout flexible.Les équipes s’attèlent autant à des missions techniques qu’à des tâches réplétives, sans besoin de compétences spécifiques. De plus, dans la plupart des cas, les finances sont limitées. Il est donc très fréquent de trouver au sein de ces structures des employés payés au black ou par les aides de l’ANPE, des stagiaires, des auto-entrepreneurs, etc. Par exemple, un restaurant aura besoin d’un chef et d’un commis de cuisine, alors qu’une startup fera appel à un CTO (directeur technique) ainsi qu’à des stagiaires pour l’épauler. Lorsqu’un restaurateur paye ses employés au black, un startuper va rémunérer ses collaborateurs via des notes de fraisPour finir, le rôle de chacun au sein du même poste peut s’avérer très variable : à commencer par le travail administratif, en passant par des tâches ménagères, le remplissage de tableaux de données, l’échange avec des clients, jusqu’à la prise de décisions stratégiques. Tout le monde est dans le même bateau, qu’on soit CEO, manager ou stagiaire. En effet, chez Fragiles, à double face… nous sommes aujourd’hui malgré tout attirés par ces petites structures. D’autant plus que de nombeux fantasmes et des idées reçues persistent autour de la restauration et les startups. Et devinez qui les relaye et les amplifie à merveille ? C’est une fois de plus, la pub et les médias, qui sélectionnent généralement pour le grand public les réussites, et non pas les nombreux échecs. On parle beaucoup du succès des startups Pour la plupart des gens, une startup est synonyme de jeunes entrepreneurs, qui ont rapidement réussi, en partant de rien, au fond du garage de leurs parents. Les levées de fonds exorbitantes font les gros titres des médias online et les rachats hors normes de certaines startups en font parler plus d’un.Le rêve est aussi présent dans la restauration. Pour les non-initiés, ouvrir un restaurant c’est « sympa », on cuisine, on goûte les plats, on accueille les clients, on invite ses amis et on encaisse l’argent. Quel serait le problème si cette « recette » existe et fonctionne depuis des centaines d’années ? On constate malheureusement une majorité d’échecs dans les deux domaines. Seulement une startup sur douze réussit (source : Startup Genome). Le chiffre des faillites de restaurants s’avère d’autant plus impressionnant : six périssent chaque jour, soit deux fois plus que le nombre de créations (source : Challenges). Le stress est omniprésent, le rythme de travail est souvent très poussé, comme expliqué précédemment les tâches sont parfois peu gratifiantes, etc. On parle aussi très peu de comment ces entrepreneurs ont ramé avant d’arriver là où ils en sont. Le cas de Frederic Mazzella, le fondateur de Eh oui ! Startupers et restaurateurs sont bien plus proches qu’on ne pouvait le parier. Nous parlons de ces entrepreneurs passionnés, qui désirent faire fleurir un produit le plus séduisant possible. Mais quelle est alors cette mystérieuse clé de la réussite ? De mon point de vue, la qualité intrinsèque du produit est le nerf de la guerre. Si une startup ou un restaurant délivre un bon produit et que le client est satisfait, alors une grande bataille est remportée. Pour une startup, on parlera d’un produit physique (ex. une montre connectée comme Pour un restaurant, il s’agit aussi bien de la qualité des produits et des compositions dans l’assiette, mais c’est aussi le service et le cadre qui entrent en jeu. Dans certains cas, le business model n’est pas viable, les marges ne sont pas assez importantes, ou encore la mise en place du produit a effrité les relations au sein de l’équipe. Cependant le client ne voit pas toute cette organisation, les difficultés, le bricolage… Peut importe l’envers du décor, il a obtenu ce qu’il voulait (voir plus). Il souhaitera peut être même recommander cette entreprises à son entourage.Seulement une fois ce résultat obtenu, libre à l’entrepreneur de retravailler son organisation interne pour que l’engrenage tourne parfaitement.D’une part, le retour client joue beaucoup sur le moral et la motivation de l’entrepreneur et de son équipe. D’autre part, le client satisfait diffusera très vite ses impressions : le bouche à oreille est aujourd’hui la plus efficace des communications pour une entreprise#Web  #Digital entrepreneur - Passionate about #Startup  #Tech

There is no reason to tear anyone apart for some silly things. One life is not enough to learn much.3) Don’t listen to what they say now, but when Myspace existed, there is not a single soul, who ever thought Myspace will collapse one day and there will be something called facebook. I can bet every single one who is suggesting now to you as an expert, would have said the samething for facebook then. BTW, there was something called Friendster before Myspace, that no one remembers. It was sent to the graveyards too.4) Let me tell you this, Mark himself thought facebook was silly when he started. He had no clue, what-so-ever. Go back and do a search, and see it for yourself. He got few $$ from Edward to pay for the server, and gave him more than 5% of the company and immediately messaged that “there is sucker born everyday” or something to that effect. Mark was clueless too.5) When Paul Graham of Y-combinator wrote to so many VC’s about Air BnB, a ton declined including the fame VC, Fred Wilson (I hope, I am not mixing up names). Go and read Fred’s email exchange with Paul. Fred is a super nice guy and has shared it publicly and is somewhere on the internet. While on the topic, few investors joked about the Cereal box made by Chesky and Nathan but Paul argued that they are like roaches and wouldn’t die. Guess what, some of these investors were left out forever and will regret for the rest of their lives.6) May be a year ago, Sheryl Sandberg (facebook COO) was on TV, telling about her joining facebook. After she hired the first CFO, the CFO made a spreadsheet to show 5 year projection. And she was like — you can make a projection? Don’t forget that she had worked with Larry Sommers before coming to facebook.7) Let me share my personal experience. I started Silicon Alley Entrepreneurs Club in New York in 1999, when NYC was not much of a tech hub and ran it through 2008. As a disclaimer, I paid for most part of it, from my own. It was not a business. I just wanted to help create a startup hub in NYC. During those period I have interacted with more than 500+ investors and may be 3000+ entrepreneurs. Not much was available on the internet those days. Founders would come to ask, what is a business plan, what is an elevator pitch, even ask what is VC, let alone know about terms such as angel investors, term sheet, convertibles, round A, B, C etc. etc. I don’t know the numbers on top of my head, but if I had to guess, I would say more than 100–200 of them eventually succeeded in building and selling companies, some small and some big, including some who are huge today. I remember in one VC-Meet, I was moderating at Morrison Forester law office in Times Square, Adeo (Founder Institute) was on the panel. I remember, talking to a founder and he had no clue what VC do. Long story short he sold his company for more than $50M few years later and doing very well today. No need to name names.8) The bottom line is, when someone calls you stupid, or belittle you just because you mentioned facebook, they are just showing their ignorance and arrogance. Once you make money, it is a lot easier to multiplying it. We have created a society where we pray money Gods and give them a pass for their nastiness. Just remember, when you are successful, be nice to others who follow you.9) Example abound but let me give you just one. The famed, much successful, Sean Parker, the ex CEO of facebook who essentially was the guy who got the first $500K from Peter Thiel to back facebook, said exactly the same thing about “Airtime”, what you are saying now on your post, except he used a much bigger megaphone. It was supposed to be world’s biggest social video platform- same thing except in video. Because he was so successful and so huge, no one could question him, hyping and he got more than $33M funding from the biggest name investors. It was hyped like nothing ever hyped before. It was a colossal failure. No one used it. During the more than a year of hype before the product launch, everyone became an expert and predicted — “how big a company it would be”- yours faithfully included-I also thought the video thing would takeoff. The moral is, no one is able to predict/see the future in the social media space, I mean no one.10) The app “Yo” was launched last year and Robert Scoble with more than 800K followers, made a note on facebook, and it made to the top downloaded app in days. They got funded and soon after it just collapsed.11) Samething with Snapchat, no one saw it becoming this big until it had already become big. Everyone and their mother thought Evan had to be crazy to refuse Mark’s offer of $3B for Snapchat then.12) Many wrote-off Elon Musk in 2008 when he was running out of money and going through divorce. Now they all line up to pray him and if they can just shake his hand, that picture will be framed for sure.13) So don’t listen to non-sense. 90% of startup fails. But as a founder you are the only one who have to believe in it and keep moving forward.14) You may succeed or fail in this venture and may pivot many times. You may fail in 5 other ventures before you succeed. The business, you may succeed could be a different business altogether. But you will learn valuable lesson each time you try, fail or succeed. That is part of being an entrepreneur. There are very few entrepreneurs who were lucky enough to had big success at the first shot.15) Check for yourself, how many times, Travis Kalanick had failed before Uber. Now, all these experts will pay money to attend conference where Travis will speak just to take a picture to post on social media.16) You may be one of those Mark Zuckerberg, I wouldn’t know and no one knows, including yourself.17) There is a lot of information available on the internet. Research and learn and you can find an ocean of information to help you.Know that there are lot of people who are rooting for people like you who are willing to try. Yes, startup is brutal-it is no cake walk. However, there is no need to be mean to anyone. Not to sound depressing- but with success and money, people tend to forget that we all will be dead one day, soon. We will be lucky, if our grandkids take the time to look for us in the family album. Be nice all the time.Wishing you good luck.============================================================Semoga banyak pelajaran yang bisa diambil, semoga menguatkan sesama sahabat startup.

As Co-Organizer of Venture Hacked, I am lucky enough to have the opportunity to pick the brains of some of the smartest and most talented VCs in Silicon Valley. Most recently, I had a chance to speak with Joel Yarmon, a successful Venture Capitalist at Draper Associates, one of the most prestigious venture firms in the country.Prior to joining Draper, Joel served as the Technology Director for the United States Senate and also co-founded an IT startup called Iceware Technologies. I had the pleasure of chatting with him and hearing a lot of insights into how he invests in startups, where his best deals come from, and what he looks for in an entrepreneur (hint: your idea doesn’t matter, YOU do).Draper Associates is an enterprise and consumer venture fund. I joined Tim Draper, my partner, 8 years ago to be his partner managing the fund, running it from a day-to-day basis, managing existing investments, and funding new investments. In the time that I’ve been here, we’ve deployed tens of millions of dollars to startups all across the country, and even across the world, in markets generally in the tens of billions of dollars, preferably, hundreds of billions of dollars in market size.Every company I invest in, I believe can get to 15–20 million dollars a year in recurring revenue and sell for hundreds of millions, or eventually go public. While we focus on big markets, we’ve also invested in everything from Bitcoin startups, to drones, to fashion, to 3D printing, and everything in between. Our checks range from 250k to 500–600k, first money in, and always in syndicate with other sophisticated investors, where the startup is generally raising 750k to a $1.5 million.I’m a big believer in making it a fair deal for entrepreneur and the venture capitalist — I have to own enough to want work hard for you as the entrepreneur, and you as the entrepreneur need to own enough so that when you do get that 20–30 million dollar acqui-hire offer, you decline and keep going. The VC’s shouldn’t own enough that you would want to sell because you’ll make more now versus raising another round, diluting even more, and then having to sell for an even higher price later to make the exact same amount of money if you were to sell earlier on.I’ve been doing this 8 years with Tim and I continue to manage Draper Associates’ existing portfolio and in the process of raising our next fund, called Pipeline Capital Partners, which in addition to my capital, and Tim’s capital, will have capital from outside investors; it’s the exact same thing as what I’ve built and developed at Draper Associates, but has the ability to take outside LP money and move faster and continue to do deals.It’s very broad in the consumer and enterprise spectrum. I’ve developed this framework that I invest out of, and for me, it is the following:So what are we interested in? It’s very broad, but once it fits this framework, I invest from my gut; and specifically, at the seed stage, it’s my job to invest in people and their dreams.The job of a VC is to provide quick and direct feedback, and the next best thing to a “Yes” is a fast “No” and feedback on why. It’s not my job to be an entrepreneur’s best friend, but rather to provide direct advice, to ask the hard questions, the dumb questions, and the smart questions to let them really benefit from the 8 years, 21 board seats, and 160+ deals of experience that I have had. A lot of companies just aren’t a fit for various reasons, but sometimes what I’ll give to the entrepreneur is my personal response and then with their permission, I may forward their deck over to a peer at another firm if there’s a fit.Ultimately, at the end of the day, the entrepreneurs are risking their lives doing their startup. As a VC, the very least that I can do is provide as much guidance as I can to send them in the right direction.The best deals for me come from my network. I’m also a big fan of incubators, like Tech Stars, Angel Pad, or Founders’ Co-Op up in Seattle. These help to have a good first filter. I’m a mentor to Tech Stars and a big believer in what they do, so I get to chat with companies before demo day, and if I see something I like, I can make them an offer before a bunch of other investors see them, which is kind of nice. But for me, the most important deal flow is from past and present CEOs, people I’ve met at conferences, and even people whose businesses I’ve met and declined. When one of my CEOs or past CEOs has a friend looking to fundraise and they send their friend my way, it says that my work product is effective and that I’m doing something right. So referrals from people I’ve invested in or invested with I treat like gold.I’m a big fan of AngelList, we’re investors, I like the guys, and I want do more deals on the platform, but I don’t use it as a method for primary sourcing just because I have a ton of deal flow elsewhere, it is a great place to go to find deals, however. With he JOBS Act and equity crowdfunding, it can become a tough game. To be a good seed investor, you have to know a lot about a little and a little about a lot. The startups aren’t publishing as much information and not all the same information that’s required by companies that are publicly traded. All investors need to use a great abundance of caution when they’re writing checks out of their personal balance sheet to invest in companies, it’s a risky business. Venture Capital returns from the year 2000, to 2010 were negative. You would have done better burning half your money and taking the other half and putting it in your mattress. After doing this for 8 years, I know how difficult it can be, and just because there’s lots of money, and Silicon Valley seems to be the center of the nation in many respects, doesn’t mean you can just throw a dart at a wall and make money.I would disagree that it’s a frustrating process. I love my job. I don’t look at myself as a money manager, I look at myself as a geek first, who happens to add a little bit of value through dollars, and hopefully, a lot more value through my experience, my relationships, and the other intangibles that I can bring to the table. Venture Capital is very unstructured, I don’t spend very much time in an office; I spend a lot of my time meeting with people, doing calls like this, and traveling — Generally, the framework is:Look at 25–30 companies to do 5–15 calls to do 5–10 first or second meetings to do 1–4 final meetings to make 1–2 offers. Then maybe 1–1.5 will decide to work with me.That funnel is constantly moving, as there are better and worse times to raise money as a startup. There are certainly fundraising cycles in the Valley. If you’re a seed stage company, you can raise pretty much at any time, but the larger amounts of capital that you need to raise comes from partnerships. Typically, the partners of these funds have families, they go on vacation, they probably have kids, and so the first VC fundraising cycle is generally January 15, after the Consumer Electronics Show, to the middle of May. Then a lot of VCs go on vacation, at which point, it’s difficult to raise series A and later rounds during the summer. The fall fundraising season is the last week of August to Thanksgiving. Inside of that window, any number of things can happen, Venture Capital is not formulaic, it’s a business of learning by doing, and there is no one recipe to funding a company. AngelList is systematizing some of it, but by and large, most of the capital that’s deployed is still deployed the way that it was 10 years ago, very much a face-to-face process and finding the right people. I wrote a blog post about this on Amazon Startup Blog; generally, you should know your VC, do your diligence on them, make sure they haven’t invested in something directly competitive, that their prior investments are complementary, and you’ve done some research to know who the best partner is to pitch to. Come up with a realistic plan for how much capital you need, enough capital to get you 12, preferably 16 months down the line, and don’t base financial plans on your best case scenario, even your middle case scenario — plan it for the worse. Too many companies and a lot of VCs spend money like it’s going out of style. Plan for the worse. If you’re wrong, so much the better, everything worked and you’re off to the races. Usually, I’m not wrong, usually it takes more capital and more time to get to wherever your plan calls for because this is a startup and it’s tough.Expect that it will take 3–4 months to fundraise and that, especially in San Francisco, it’s going to cost you more to do everything: to hire people, to get office space, to travel around the city because it’s so clogged. You also don’t want to hire or expand too quickly or increase your burn in anticipation of having customers; it’s important to do a lot of experiments, a lot of customer acquisition funnels, a lot of meetings with different VCs, and different advisors, don’t just try to raise from 5 or 10 of the top groups on Sand Hill and when none of them fund you, you call it quits.As I mentioned, to be a good seed stage investor, you have to know a lot about a little and a little about a lot. I don’t think it helps as much when you come from Wall Street and do seed stage, because your understanding of the application of technology isn’t necessarily there. I built my first computer when I was 9 and I built my last computer in November, it’s sitting under my desk right now. I’ve always been a big geek, jail breaking iPhones and what not, and I’ve got probably 30 or 40 IP addresses on my home network, which is run with enterprise gear. When you have a real love for technology and you grasp that, that helps you break down some barriers with the entrepreneurs when they sit down and they think of you, the VC, as just a money guy that they have to walk their idea through. Once they realize that I get the tech and understand it, a lot of the pretense is dropped and I can dig in, not only into the business but also into the entrepreneur themselves as a person and vice versa.I came into venture through a very circuitous route; I think that really has given me a great advantage when it comes to chatting with entrepreneurs, who may similarly have a very diverse background. I don’t think there is a right way or wrong way to get into venture. Certainly, there are more people who came from Ivy League schools and worked at banks and are now in Venture Capital. Are those people valuable? Yes. Does the press, and even Venture Capital, often lament the lack of diversity? Yes. And so we could probably benefit from having more VCs from different walks of life. I think that my background and the successes that I have been fortunate enough to have, have certainly convinced me that, as I start my own firm and look to bring partners and employees, I shouldn’t be looking to buy what everybody else is buying.Once I qualify the market size, the “Nerds to Normals,” the simple revenue model, the margins work, and it fits into the consumer and enterprise tech space, I toss the idea out into the open. So much of what I do comes from not just my brain, but from my gut. It is something that is uniquely intangible, and it’s one of those things where you know it when you really feel it.It is very rare that you will hear a truly unique idea. Most ideas are not completely new. They’re building upon something else, or taking advantage of an existing market, or they are aggregating something which is very long tail. Look at some of the greatest businesses today: Before Uber, there were taxis. Before Pinterest, there was Facebook and Twitter. Before Hotmail and Gmail, there was the USPS and the fax. Yet these are some of the greatest businesses which have literally changed the face of the planet, but it’s not really the idea, it’s the people behind the idea, who act as catalysts, who execute on an opportunity to drive real change and create real value for people everywhere.The reason that I do what I do is because I believe strongly in this country. America from the beginning of time, through today, with our LLC laws, corporate laws and corporate protections, and even the way the tax break works in some states, promotes and allows people to take risks. And when you take a risk, you often end up with some of the greatest companies the world has ever seen. I mentioned a bunch of them, and those companies were all created here and it is our responsibility as people in and around the startup scene, whether you are on the financing side or the startup side, to continue to embrace those protections and to start your company here, and to have a mindset that When you think about what it is you want to do with your life and when you think about the risks that you want to take, and when you look back on everything the world has had and the world has seen, I hope that for a greater and greater portion of people out there, that means not only coming here to get a great education, but wanting to stay here, and not wanting to go work for some big slow moving, stodgy company, but wanting to take a risk at literally changing the world. Regardless of whether or not the economy is good or bad, it’s never been a better time to start a company than right now, and I encourage everybody who is thinking about it to take the plunge, because you don’t have that much to lose and you have everything to gain; and Be sure to follow Joel on Twitter For more information on Venture Hacked and to register for our next “Speed Investing” event, please visit our Co-Founder, 

Depuis tout petit, je me prédestinais à une vie bien rangée. Finir mes études dans les réseaux et télécoms, trouver un bon job, finir GTA V, trouver une copine, fonder une famille, avoir des enfants, devenir vieux… Bref une vie sans trop de soucis !Après avoir finit ma licence, je me motive difficilement pour deux ans de Master, sur les conseils d’amis avisés. Gestion de projet, management, gestion budgétaire, communication… Cool pour quelqu’un qui n’est intéressé que par la technique ! Les deux années allaient être très longues..Parmi tous ces cours, un me laisse particulièrement perplexe: Pas super motivé, je commence à écouter son cours et regarder attentivement sa keynote: A ce moment j’ai su ce que je souhaitais faire les prochaines années de ma vie. GTA V allait devoir attendre..Le petit hic, Mais l’objectif startup était plus fort que ça. Donc avec mon partenaire, on se sort les doigts du ass, et l’on cherche des idées tout en Difficilement le soir, après les cours et nos journées de boulot (Alternance powa), on apprends le code. Ces longues soirées à apprendre à coder furent très éprouvantes, surtout au niveau de notre vie perso. Après tout est une question d’organisation ;) Mais bon, le jeu en vaut la chandelle.Puis on sort une première application, Puis au bout d’un moment, je tombe malade… Le coca et une salade Mexicaine avaient eu raison de moi, et la malbouffe en général ! Après avoir vomi pendant trois heures non stop (Une expérience très intéressante dans une vie), j’ai eu une sorte révélation (La cuvette des WC m’a parlé). J’ai su quel problème j’allais résoudre et qui allait aider les gens (Ou au moins moi): J’en parle à mon partenaire, et l’adoption de la cause fut quasi immédiate. C’est bon, nous avions trouvé un projet dans lequel se concrétiser, L’obtention du Master 2 signe la fin d’une partie de ma vie, et le commencement d’une autre. Ainsi dès début Septembre, mon partenaire et moi on se consacre pleinement sur cette aventure ! Notre but n’est pas forcément de devenir millionnaire, mais simplement de créer Et comme le dit très bien Pour le moment notre Co-Founder Move thinking forward

When I first read these words a year ago, they broke my heart. I took it hard. I was banking everything on getting into Y Combinator. I day-dreamed about it for weeks. The fact that they’d give me 120K and let me stay in San Francisco to work on my startup seemed like the best thing I could ask for. I’ve never been to SF let alone California and have always wanted to go. So for those few weeks while I waited on a decision I tried to stay optimistic. Most of the time I actually thought they’d choose my startup. I mean, why wouldn’t they? I was working on the next big thing, something that could potentially be the next Twitter or Facebook (every applicant thinks that right?). But that night, I got the rejection email and my dreams came crashing down.It’s hard not to be bitter towards these accelerators. Especially because none of them give you the reason why they rejected you. You never know if your idea just plain sucks or if they would have accepted you but they just didn’t have enough spots. Information like that is what can keep startups motivated. What we want most is confirmation that we are not wasting our time. Sometimes this can be more important to us than getting into the accelerator.My guess is this probably happens to most people trying to get a startup off the ground. Reading about startup accelerators, getting your hopes up, thinking you’ll get in, getting rejected, and then finding a new startup accelerator to cling onto. That was me for the next several months until I got so many rejection emails I decided I needed to just start focusing on releasing the damn app.The second time I applied for Y Combinator I did it last minute, without giving it too much effort. I didn’t want to sound too desperate, I wanted it to sound like “hey, you guys would be lucky if you picked me.” not vice-versa. But yesterday, I read the same words I had read a year ago. This time it didn’t hurt as much. I deleted the email and moved on because I realized something: I’ll do this on my own if I have to, whether people believe in me or not. I’m in this for the long run.I think that’s what defines a true entrepreneur. Someone who will keep trekking through even when they are rejected. There is nothing that can stop us. Even if it turns out that this app is not the one that will break through, I know for a fact that I’ll get there because I will never stop creating.I was tempted to end this by saying “…so don’t give up my friends!” but I don’t need to because the people who are driven to succeed will never give up.We can’t be stopped.CEO and Creator of

Le storie e le idee di tutti

Iniciar uma startup com serviços focados em grandes empresas pode ser loucura. Quando uma grande empresa abrirá suas portas para conhecer um serviço novo, sem muito histórico de sucesso?Neste desafio vivemos todos os dias com a Lotebox. A venda para grandes empresas não é uma tarefa fácil, mas temos aprendido como prospectar, fazer o primeiro contato e desenvolver um plano de A palavra mágica neste cenário é Você não será recebido sem saber exatamente com quem está lidando. Desde a geração de leads, identifique quem são os Quando os leads se tornarem contatos aquecidos estude como estas empresas se colocam e qual o impacto delas no mercado, visto isso, identifique suas necessidades e visões de futuro. Uma das principais lições aprendidas é que não se vê valor em modelos tradicionais de venda, onde para implantar uma nova solução é necessário parar e treinar toda a empresa.Conhecer o comportamento permitirá que você entregue algo que gere real valor sem demandar tempo de treinamento, foque em soluções Uma vez identificado os comportamentos se tornarão visíveis os gargalos, grandes empresas são muitas vezes engessadas em seus processos, logo têm uma série de gargalos na operação. Seu papel é identificá-los o quanto antes e reforçar como sua solução melhorará estes pontos.Pensar em soluções que atendam empresas grandes, mas também potencializem a capacidade de produção dos pequenos é um ótimo exercício para entregar serviços que sejam escaláveis em mercados B2B.Quem vende soluções B2B precisa conhecer muito bem os movimentos do mercado, faça pesquisas sobre dados históricos e previsões de futuro, isto lhe permitirá entender as expectativas destes mercados. Uma das vantagens se ser startup neste cenário é a facilidade que temos de nos mover e mudar mais rápido que as grandes empresas que concorrem conosco.Não importa qual seja seu público alvo, não dê o primeiro passo sem entender como é o mercado global. Grandes empresas buscam tendências globais, então não tenha uma visão local.Com a Lotebox identificamos como se comporta o mercado local e o global, esta visão pode ser representada por um iceberg.A parte visível é o mercado local, aquilo que está próximo da sua realidade e com fácil acesso, por outro lado entendemos que agir local é ter problemas de escala pelas particularidades que este cenário micro apresenta.Contudo a parte submersa é o mercado global, um cenário macro com padrões, regras e tendências internacionais; claro que o acesso as empresas de outros países é difícil, mas uma vez entendido este comportamento você terá uma solução com alto potencial de escala global.Portanto pese muito bem quais são as suas estratégias de Por mais que você esteja num mercado B2B, Depois de uma temporada nos EUA percebi que grandes marcas têm se aproximado cada vez mais das startups. O objetivo de aproximação não é só ter estas empresas como prestadores de serviço, há um interesse maior por trás.Empresas como Airbus, Mercedes-Benz e Target buscam constantemente diferenciais para se manterem competitivas no mercado que atuam, ter soluções inovadoras por perto pode ser a garantia de se manter atualizado com as novas tendências tecnológicas.Esta aproximação tem acontecido principalmente para: (1) Investir em novas empresas, portanto ser uma startup B2B é também olhar estas grandes empresas como potenciais investidores; (2) Parcerias estratégicas, é possível que você seja convidado a ser parceiro de uma grande marca em troca de exclusividade ou algum outro benefício e (3) Aquisições, sim grandes empresas têm comprado startups e isto não é ruim! Imagine ter uma solução comprada pela Mercedes-Benz?!Uma das maiores descobertas que tivemos estando em contato com as grandes empresas é que a principal necessidade delas pode ser resumida em uma frase:Melhorar processos gera mais impacto que grandes soluções tecnológicas, pode não parecer, mas nosso trabalho mais duro é mapear [bem] os processos destas empresas, identificar os gargalos (como falei) e usar da tecnologia como motor na mudança destes.Lembre-se que a venda de soluções que demandam treinamento é bola fora, foque em soluções que visualmente não interfiram tanto no dia a dia das pessoas, mas que por trás você está aumentando a performance operacional e gerando inteligência estratégica.Há espaço para novas tecnologias dentro das grandes empresas, nosso papel como empreendedor é construir os canais certos para atingir os alvo esperados.Founder at Compartilho conhecimentos adquiridos ao longo da vida e temas que acho importante na jornada do empreendedor, principalmente para o empreendedor de Startup

By Last summer, FireEye Chief Information Security Officer Craig Rosen was bracing himself for yet another pitch from a security startup about how their next-generation, machine-learning, big data, insert-buzz-word-here solution would be a silver bullet for his security woes — the creepiness of shadow IT! — when his ears perked up. The presenting company, One of the most reliable ways to succeed as an enterprise startup is by delivering an impressive and world-class experience to your customers. Simply building the best technology, or even putting together the best sales and marketing machine, is no longer enough to stand out, particularly in a crowded marketplace of vendors. The companies that do succeed — like Adallom, which was just “We’re not a security vendor; we’re a security partner.” I hear this pitch from startups all the time. A partnership, however, is not just marketing lingo you use to close a deal. It’s a reputation that is earned through honest effort and integrity; companies should always underpromise and overdeliver. Unfortunately, a large number of security companies fail to appreciate the power of that promise. In one particularly memorable case, Adallom had to deal with a problem common to many companies experiencing rapid growth: an irate customer. Instinctually, the management team sent the client a handwritten letter, contacted every board member about the issue and made tough choices to resolve the issue within 48 hours. The team went so far above and beyond expectations that the customers ultimately turned down Adallom’s offer to return their payment and instead doubled-down on their relationship with the company.Adallom’s product focus is oriented around a tectonic shift in IT: namely, the idea that data has moved to a new perimeter. Numerous startups have tackled this issue with different approaches, such as prioritization of data encryption or focusing on identity management. Adallom’s solution prioritizes the experience of the end user and the security practitioner while enabling the greatest amount of security. To ensure users would not change behavior or experience any degradation of functionality, Adallom adopted a hybrid deployment model and limited themselves to a few key SaaS applications: Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365, Google Apps, and Box. These constraints naturally limited their audience of potential early-adopter lighthouse customers, but was the right decision to benefit their users at the time.Adallom early on was approached by many potential prospects, and learning the discipline to say ‘no’ was really tough. Discipline is tough to train, and I’ve heard the same four rationales justifying a smattering pipeline of small and large accounts over and over again at other startups too:Adallom’s strategy, from the start, was to build a product for large-scale enterprises like select Fortune 500 companies and other significant adopters of cloud services. These customers come with specific product requirements (think: scale, functionality, and fun features like LDAP integrations), so the best way to engage them is through the classic, go-to market enterprise model of a direct field sales organization.In implementing this strategy, however, all of the common rationales for justifying interactions with small accounts becomes a real drag: All usage is not equal; the unit economics do not work if the ASP is not high enough; product feedback is not uniformly relevant; and the defocusing from large accounts really delays reference accounts. Although Index Ventures (and yes, it was the shortest sales cycle in company history) is proud to be an early customer of Adallom, the company wisely did not try to sell our friends at Sequoia. Eventually their more focused efforts ultimately yielded much more important reference partners like HP.Securing HP was an important milestone for Adallom. In fact, HP quickly became a meaningful customer, a global distribution partner and an investor in Adallom. Given HP’s reputation and size, they were able to become true advocates for Adallom’s services and not just a logo to plaster on their website. It’s hard to quantify, but there’s this amazing domino effect once a company gets its first five to 10 reference accounts that changes the dynamic, speed and confidence of the organization. As with most large companies, however, HP was a challenging client to convince.Having a successful customer-centric business starts right at the top. Founders need to be right in the trenches at the start. At Adallom, for example, the company initially took a non-scalable approach to growth: Two of the three founders were on every single customer call, and the third was delivering superfast one-day turnarounds on client requests. Though this was not sustainable, it was important early on for the founders to both inspire their customers and turn them into early adopters, as well as build the company’s collective muscle for knowing how to best sell the product.It’s been a true pleasure supporting Assaf, Ami, Roy, Yinon, Michael, Danelle and the whole crew at Adallom, as well as collaborating with Gilli, Zohar, Jeff and Jerry. When it mattered most, these guys did what was necessary, fast. I’m so proud that they’ll continue the next step of their journey with Microsoft.We are a multi-stage international VC firm.

I’ve spent alot of time over the last few years exploring ideas for tech startup businesses. I’d like to share with you what has worked for me.It’s still popular to talk about ‘ideas’, but too often than not ideas are formed on unproven or untested hypotheses and we get caught up in the excitement of the idea than the excitement of the problem we’re solving. I believe it’s more important to have passion for solving the problem than it is the idea.Try some of these for problem + idea generation:Finally, get into the habit of writing every idea down. You’ll begin to see a nice collection of thoughts that when reviewed together at a later date will form new patterns. The habit of capturing your thoughts leads to fascinating insights on reflection.

Jeden Gründer treibt eines wohl immer mal wieder um: Die Angst zu Versagen. In unserer Gründerkolumne schreibe ich diesmal, wieso wir EDITION F trotzdem gewagt haben.Es mag abgedroschen klingen, aber es ist wahr. Immer wieder ließ ich mir vor der Entscheidung zu Gründung die von Sheryl Sandberg gestellte Frage in ‚Lean in’ durch den Kopf gehen:Die Antwort: Gründen. Doch etwas hielt mich davon ab. Die Angst zu Versagen. Zu Scheitern. Aufgeben zu müssen. Und damit etwas zu verlieren, dass mir wichtig war: Anerkennung und Sicherheit.Noch nie habe ich einen Job so gerne gemacht wie den bei Immer wieder gab es die gleiche Antwort. „Ich fühle mich fast wie ein Entrepreneur, ich bin glücklich, kann selbst vieles aufbauen.“Das war einerseits richtig, aber genau genommen nur eine halbe Wahrheit. Am Ende lag die Entscheidung nicht bei mir, am Ende konnte ich die Strategie nur bedingt mitgestalten, am Ende war die Vision nur bedingt meine. Und wenn ich richtig ehrlich zu mir war, hatte ich einfach nur große Angst vor dem Versagen.Das Scheitern ein Teil der Startupszene ist, wird spätestens mit dem Blick auf die üblichen Venture-Capital-Rechnungen deutlich. Üblicherweise gehen Investoren davon aus, dass nur drei von zehn Startups wirklich erfolgreich werden. Wirklich viel Geld durch einen Exit gibt es vielleicht sogar nur bei einem von zehn Startups.In Deutschland ist Scheitern ein Stigma. 2013 tauchte in der deutschen Startup-Szene dann plötzlich ein neuer Trend auf. Es war ok zu Scheitern, fast schon wurde es Teil des guten Tons. Immer hatten Gründer aufPanels oder im Redaktionsgespräch ein oder zwei Anekdoten vom kleinen Scheitern im Petto. Es wurden Artikel darüber geschrieben, wie gut Scheitern ist. Sogar eigene Konferenzen wie die FailCon widmeten sich dem Thema.Kein Wunder. War es doch in den USA, da wo die großen Startups gemacht werden, Gang und Gäbe, dass Gründer bis zu acht Anläufe wagen, bis sie zum ersten Mal richtig erfolgreich sind. Große Investoren würden sogar lieber in Gründer investieren, die schon einmal negative Erfahrungen gemacht hätten, so erzählen es sich Gründer. Erfolgreich werden Gründer, die schon einmal erkannt hatten, dass niemand ihr Produkt wollte, das Team nicht passte oder sie auf schlechten Rat nicht hören sollten.Meine Angst vor dem Scheitern blieb. Meine Idee vor der Gründung von EDITION F im Herbst 2013: Bereits vor der Kündigung das Geschäftsmodell entwickeln, erste Investoren überzeugen, vielleicht sogar online gehen. Geschlagene zwei Wochen planten meine Mitgründerin Susann und ich, neben dem Job zu gründen. Drei Gespräche überzeugten mich dann, dass das eine Unmöglichkeit ist.So begann die Reise von EDITION F und Susann und mir.Wer gründet vertraut in seine Qualifikation. Die Idee, die Susann und ich hatten, deckt sich zu 100 Prozent mit unserer Leidenschaft. Und plötzlich war die Angst vor dem Scheitern unbedeutend.Dieser Artikel erschien zuerst auf der Seite von unserem Startup Der perfekte Mitgründer: Das Team ist in jedem Unternehmen zentral. Das trifft auf die Gründer ganz besonders zu. Gegenpole oder Zwillinge? Was macht Gründerduos aus? Die große Angst vor dem Versagen. Jeden Gründer treibt eines wohl immer mal wieder um: Die Angst, zu versagen. In unserer Gründerkolumne schreibt Nora, wieso wir EDITION F gewagt haben. Jeden Tag aufs Neue: Antrieb und Freiheit. Die eigenen Maßstäbe und Ansprüche sind hoch. Und manchmal werden sie zum Fallstrick und verstellen den Blick auf das, was unsere Leidenschaft weckt. Founder of EDITION F. In Love with Writing.

This is an entrepreneur’s guide for hardware investors. The goal of this Guide is to show the differences between hardware and software startups and why the standard investment tests you can use for software often don’t work with hardware, or at least they are not enough. I couldn’t find any meaningful resources for those who want to invest in hardware or are generally interested in hardware startup mechanics. So I decided to write one.So if you’re interested in learning more about the differences between an early stage software vs. hardware startup, the hardware specific risks and ways to mitigate them, do read on.In my experience, there are five well-defined phases in the process of making and launching a hardware product. That’s important because it significantly differs from a software startup.In the In the The There is one additional risk involved. As long as the company produces small batches, it’s somewhere below ground on the totem pole of importance with suppliers. Orders will get cancelled, changed and misplaced. Even worse, I’ve seen poor PCB manufacturing, fake chips on the circuits, forged power supplies, electromagnetic influences on stability of the circuits and a whole bunch of other, unforeseen issues.Hardware is hard. For a reason. But that’s also an advantage.For a hardware product you obviously need to design hardware. This means circuits, electronics and everything else that comes with it. Designing hardware is a long process and has one significant disadvantage: limited iteration capabilities. If a software startup can write and deploy code, Facebook style, on a daily basis, that’s not the case in hardware. Sure, there are prototyping and simulation tools for hardware, but nothing compares to a real working circuit. And one needs several versions of those to learn about the product and iterate. That takes time.Depending on the target market, industrial design is important. For consumer products, it is one of the key areas. And industrial design is demanding. Some startups opt for external designers, some for in-house ones. Whichever model a startup chooses, iteration is key. Finding a way to integrate industrial design with user experience, UI and everything else demands a lot of iteration. Simply ordering a design from an external firm without an option to iterate and develop further is bad practice.Firmware is the hidden virus in any hardware firm that does electronics. Firmware is the layer that makes hardware alive and appealing. A company without firmware resources is dead before is even born. Sure, it’s easy to make firmware that makes hardware work, however writing firmware that’s efficient, allows for remote update, safe to use… that’s hard and the firmware person/team needs to work closely with the hardware and software engineering teams.Hardware products cannot be wired overseas like software. It takes resources to take care of logistics. Packaging, shipping, customs, declarations, warranties… That’s actually one of the few things that you can safely outsource, but at a price. However, it’s still a good practice to do the initial steps in-house to get the feel of the process. It’s much easier to outsource when you know what you’re outsourcing.When putting hardware on the market, certification for different markets is necessary. A product for consumers cannot be placed on the market without appropriate certification. To make things worse, there are different certifications for different markets like EU, US, Australia… If the company is active in a specialized industry with additional requirements, multiply the effort by 10!Creating a new product requires organizing manufacturing as well. It takes time and experience. When a company is scaling, outsourcing manufacturing to an overseas manufacturer makes a lot of sense. However, outsourcing overseas is not optimal when the company is still designing a new product and has to figure out how they are going to manufacture it. If the company is well funded, it can afford to hire experts to do it for them. But if it’s well funded, it’s out of scope of this guide. Then the company doesn’t need your help as an early stage investor anymore.The key to product positioning is to understand what startup’s target market is. Talking broadly, there are three target markets and designing for them greatly influences recruiting, design and production processes.Target markets clearly define what should be the core advantages of the startup. In consumer products, high tech comes secondary to usability and design, while in business products, utility and manageability is key. These things define what kind of talent, plans and timeframes the startup needs to put in place, and it’s a great tool to analyse the startup’s strategic ability to plan and sync their resources with their market.Traction is obviously a proof of growth. In the hardware world that translate to sales, measured in number of products sold/shipped. Period. The reason for this is that if you want to compare it to anything, you need to have a comparable unit. Money is not one because you have no clue about the margin, so you’re comparing sales of different products.When checking the number of supporters on Kickstarter, you see that the volume of supporters for successful Kickstarter projects is between 2000–8000 in majority of cases, maybe even less. That’s it. That number, almost by definition, are early adopters.Comparing traction to other hardware startups makes more sense, but there are fairly few precedents available.As you can see, the traction pipeline could be organized as a classical sales pipeline/funnel, incorporating the chances of dropoff/conversion and thus assessing the health of traction. If you look at numbers of signups, reservations, orders or shipped products per month, you could use a conversion factor like: signups 5%, reservations 65%, pre-orders 90%, shipped 100%. Multiply the factor by the reported number and you’ll get a comparable unit of shipped/sold products, or number of customers. With that you can easily see and compare the traction of the product and compare it to the potential or addressable market.With physical products one must be aware that traction is highly dependant on distribution/marketing. So a few questions need to be asked: What’s been the PR/exposure effort to date and how has the startup approached media and markets? How about distribution, is the company using distributors or partners? One important issue is also marketing: Google Ads and similar might work, however one must know how much advertising is being used to generate traction?Margins and bill-of-material (BOM) are very important concepts in hardware startups, but often ignored. In vast majority of cases, hardware startups make products that need to be sold to their clients. Margin and BOM are inversely correlated. Even though in theory we have different BOM’s, in the hardware startup world the term BOM is most often everything that it costs to build a unit without direct costs of the company. Material, assembly, packaging… Subtract that from unit price and you get the margin.How the product gets to the customers is often the key to success. In the software/services world people like to talk about virality or similar mechanisms for distribution. That’s way harder in the hardware world.What about IP and patent? That’s one of my favorite questions that I like to debate with investors. I’ve seen offers that conditioned investment by a requirement to patent a part of tech. Here are several layers to think through.First, if the company has been bootstrapping, it’s highly likely that they cannot afford a patent process. I’ve talked with an investor who was trying to convince me that patenting was cheap. Clearly he never set foot out of his glass tower and tried bootstrapping or filing for a patent.Second, a startup’s resources are extremely stretched, so patentability is something a startup can start thinking about when they have money for. So the right question to a startup is not: “Do you have patents?”, but rather: “Is there anything patentable and how much will it cost?” and then add this number to the investment offer.Third, until a startup is successful and has significant funds/revenues/traction, it is highly sensitive to any kind of litigation. Here there is a big difference between continental Europe and US. In US, basically everybody carries its own costs and there is almost no first-use protection for IP. In continental Europe, there is first-use precedent, lawyer fees are reasonable and often with a ceiling, and whoever loses carries all costs of the winning party. So at least in Europe patent litigation is slightly more just, but that’s not the point.The point is that, on average, starting a patent litigation in US costs at least $1MM. That’s the sort of money a startup does not have. So if an investor is worried about that, they should put up that money on the table in case of the patent lawsuit. At least in the very early stage. Putting conditions on patents during investments, and not providing contingency cash, is counterproductive.Quite often we hear that we should manufacture in China. The rationale behind manufacturing overseas is of course the price.I do not understand how anyone can justify going overseas for the first 4 phases of the hardware startup process. The volatility of sketching, prototyping, testing and first batch manufacturing phases is so high, that you simply need to be very close to the manufacturing line. Of course, if you plan to be based in Shenzen, that’s perfectly fine, but the majority of startups I know are based in Europe or US. They are at least 6 time zones away from China or Taiwan. How anyone considers iterating on a such long distance lean, is beyond me.On top of the usual 12-month-runway-to-get-to-the-next-level, at a hardware startup one must account for initial costs and working capital.Another interesting resource that is different from software startups are the initial cost requirements. They are significant in comparison to a software company. There are development kits for processors, which often cost several thousands of dollars, a 3d printer doesn’t hurt, but some 3d printing services can be outsourced.This is probably the most underestimated resource for a hardware startup. Working capital is needed to order batches of products that the company sells to customers. The company has to pay for goods, that it can sell. If everything else remains equal, working capital is on top of the capital requirements for a comparable software company. At least for the initial batches. Banks will finance the working capital, but only when you have a running business or funding. Usually not for a few months-old startup without any customers.Another important issue is the nature of batches. Unless the startup is extremely lucky to have just-in-time production capabilities, they need to order production in batches. Again, each batch requires working capital, but also means that it carries certain lead times to be manufactured. That’s a production cycle. It’s a major curse for early stage startups. Usually, production cycles are between 8–12 weeks, so if the startup is successful in selling their product fast, and if they don’t have enough capital to finance at least 2 production cycles, they will have a hard time keeping their market presence, because there are not a lot of clients that will put up with several months of backlogs. So, as an investor, you have to realistically assess what are the startup needs and support them with initial batches. If you’re not prepared to do that, don’t invest in hardware startups.Fundraising for hardware is different than fundraising for a software startup. If one looks at three (often misused) stages of startup investing it’s obvious that the differences are huge.The fun discussion with investors is often about pricing. The elasticity of prices for hardware is something that most people think they understand without any proof. Since hardware startups produce physical objects similar to the ones in stores, we like to compare them to others.However, often pricing suggestions by “informed” individuals have little to do with the real world. As long as the startup sells to early adopters, they can charge whatever they want, if they can sell it. There is no right price! When they go mass-market, they’ll need to adjust pricing to whatever the retailer thinks it makes sense. But going mass-market will totally change economics, and since new product revisions take a year, there will be plenty of time to figure it out.Another important consideration is the pricing model. The basic decision is between continuous and one-off charge. It is a valid option, though not always. The important variable to consider is also the product’s lifespan. If I can increase the margin to incorporate future cash flows of subscription into the model, I’d rather charge one time than force users to pay monthly as well, especially if it’s likely a small amount. The case is particularly strong if it’s reasonable to expect that a happy customer will buy a newer model after a few years. That’s where you can achieve continuity. Smartphone producers are masters of that model.There are a lot of difficulties and challenges when dealing with a hardware business; however, I find a some quite important and different from software startups.It’s up to investors to figure out what makes sense for the business they invest in. However, directly copying software models when analyzing hardware is dangerous and often leads to bad decisions.I have always been wondering: Where do hardware investors get their training from?There is plenty of resources available for entrepreneurs. Blogs, books, accelerators seem to be popping up like mushrooms ranging from very useless advices like: “Hire a world class team!” to actionable frameworks. A training or a book does not a successful founder make, however it does straighten up the vocabulary and at least gives a small taste of what they’re getting into if deciding to go the startup route.But I couldn’t find anything similar for investors or those who are interested in working closely with hardware startups. And yet most of the people I talk to seem to be very confident in their experience when discussing the business of hardware. There are some exceptions, however in general they couldn’t have gotten it from past deals, because there have simply not been enough hardware startups or exits around to gain meaningful domain experience. What usually happens is that investors (at best) try to apply the wisdom from software investing into hardware, by adding atoms to bits. Unfortunately it’s never that simple.Am I qualified to write it? Probably not. In past, I ran several software startups and fundraised in Europe and the US, lead a successful accelerator, and now I run a hardware startup. I’m in contact with investors on a daily basis, but have never been a VC.The issues outlined here will give you the tools to better understand your investment and evaluate it. In my view, a hardware startup business is an order of magnitude more complex than a software business with similar resources. However, I also believe that every issue that makes a hardware startup more complex is actually a potential competitive advantage. Because a competitor will have to deal with the same issues. And this is exactly where investors can make a difference!The Guide is published on this site and will be occasionally updated. So please do comment on it.

Last month we announced the closing of My colleague It was a great journey we went through. I talked to a lot of great people, got a lot of (good and bad) feedback and learned a lot while building my first startup.Nevertheless, there are a lot of reasons, why our startup eventually didn’t work out. I summarized some of our main pitfalls and learnings we had. All of these reasons are very subjectively and may not be true or appropriate for a different product or industry.Replacing an existing product is much harder than introducting a new product. The risk of replacing an already working product/plugin is too high for many companies, especially if the company can’t benefit (= get more revenue) directly from it.With a discussion plugin like orat.io, which aimed to raise revenue implicitly through user engagement and brand building, companies couldn’t see a raise of revenue in first place.We totally underestimated the time we needed for sales and support. Especially when it comes to big corporates (like media houses), sales will take much more longer than expected.To make an easier transition when replacing their existing comment section, we offered a 30 day free trial. For most customers we needed about 1 month for upfront “sales” (most of the time is figuring out who is the person in charge for such a decision), so that customers are willing to give it a try. After the 30 day trial period, most companies needed about 1–2 month to evaluate the outcome and ask their manager for budgets. That ended up in ~3–4 months acquisition time, which is way too much for a startup with only 25k in funding and a 6 month runtime.When launching your product, it’s very important to decide on which customers to focus on. In our case we had to decide, if we want to focus on bloggers or corporates. Since bloggers are hard to monetize, we decided to go for corporates and media houses. This was probably not the best decision, since bloggers are hard to monetize, but they are adopting new technologies or tools way more easily.You can build the best and most performant software ever, still no one bats an eye. The only thing which is important is your product, not your codebase. You can have the shittiest codebase on earth, if people love your product, it’s ok. Unfortunately it doesn’t work the other way round. Therefore use your time to talk to (potential) customers instead of improving your software, especially when joining an accelerator. This will also be your biggest benefit for the future, even when your startup fails.None of these reasons is an excuse that orat.io didn’t work out, rather it was a crucial learning. Nevertheless it was a great experience which I didn’t regret and at some point in the future I’ll definitely find a new project to work on again. For now, I’m happy that I had the possibility to join tech lead

2015 marks the third year anniversary of Love With Food. It’s surreal to think that three years ago I was a team of one, and now we are a team of 15 people. I’ve spoken at many events in the last three years, even one titled “How to Turn an Idea into a Multimillion Dollar Business.” I’ve also been in the press, Am I glad I ditched my engineering consulting career for a risky venture? Hell yeah, but it wasn’t a walk in the park. It’s been a hell of a ride that never ends! No business school will ever be able to teach what I’ve learned–the only way to learn is to walk the journey. One founder recently told me, “You’ve earned your badge of honor because you’ve suffered the pain.” So what did I learn through this walk of pain?If someone tells you it’s going to get easier after you’ve raised the next round, it’s a big lie. It doesn’t get any easier. You’ll feel good the day after you closed the round, but the pressure to deliver exponential growth immediately kicks in. I’ve raised two rounds of funding, and it didn’t get any easier after each round. In fact, the more money I’ve raised, the greater the expectations and the greater the pressure. The challenges I had to deal with were much bigger and more complicated over time.My criteria for hiring now is culture fit, which is mainly comprised of being hungry and ambitious. This combination is the key ingredient for startup growth. It trumps any MBA, Ivy League education or “C” level experience. If grit is not part of your DNA, then a start-up is not the right environment for you.Firing fast is also crucial. I dreaded the first fire, but once the person was gone, many problems also went away instantly. When someone underperforms or hurts the culture, it’s important to act fast otherwise the person could be toxic to the environment.Love With Food’s mission statement is“It’s easy to lose sight of the end game as we grow. It’s good to have a mission statement that’s communicated frequently to align everyone and to ensure we are all moving toward the same end goal. Setting our core values sets the expectations on our behavior and actions. It sets the guiding principle on how we treat one another and how we work.Having a mission statement and a set of core values are important because they help the team understand right from wrong, especially in times of conflicts. It helps to resolve disagreement because the solution must always be aligned with our mission.Since the beginning of LWF, I’ve been in charge of online marketing. I’m a software engineer learning the ropes of the online marketing world. I started playing with Facebook ads back in 2011 and got very proficient in running Facebook ads. In early 2014, I decided to outsource our acquisition to an online agency, expecting the agency would do a better job than me. After all, it’s their bread and butter. Well, I was so wrong. They couldn’t acquire new customers as efficiently as I could. Lesson learned — no one will ever understand our customers better than me or anyone on the LWF team because we live and breathe the brand everyday.I’m a very analytical person. I love looking at data and making decisions. However, for an early stage start-up, most of the time, we don’t have sufficient data to analyze. So I often follow my gut. It’s hard to go wrong when you make decisions based on your first instinct because your first instinct is almost always right!As a founder, it’s very easy to work non-stop. I work about 14–16 hours a day everyday, including weekends. I stopped exercising because my theory was exercise less, so I could work more. I was completely wrong. The six months that I stopped exercising was my worst. I wasn’t a good leader. I was always cranky, exhausted and I was experiencing a higher level of anxiety and stress 24/7.Exercising isthe only time I have for myself. It’s the only time I’m doing something for my well-being. Exercising keeps me centered and my thoughts more clear.I’ll wake up in the middle of the night panicking or in cold sweat. There are so many things on my mind, which issue should I start tackling first? Often, I would wake up thinking of one particular problem and this one problem disrupts my sleep night after night. My body was showing me a sign. Out of the 1,001 issues, whatever was continuing to awaken me, it was the biggest problem I had to take care of immediately.As the company grows, the sense of responsibility just gets stronger. The fear of failing my team and my investors accelerates. I can be quick and reckless when I was a one-woman show but now, whatever decision I make, it affects 15 people on my team and many more investors.In the last three years, I probably heard 50 times more No’s than Yes’s. By now, I’m immune to rejection. People may reject me and my ideas for many reasons, but I never wasted time finding out why. I would rather spend my time and energy on the next hustle.The entrepreneurial journey is a very lonely one. One of our very early investors made a pact with me. He would only invest if I promised to have lunch with him once a month and share with him all the good, bad and ugly. I thought it was silly since I didn’t need a shrink, but I made the promise anyway.I’m so glad I did. I fully understand now his intentions. He’s a serial entrepreneur and he knows how lonely the journey is. I look forward to our monthly lunches and I honestly will tell him all the challenges, stress, big plans, good news, every little detail of my roller coaster ride. Not only is it it’s good to pour it all out, it’s even better to have someone who has been there, done that, to tell me what I’m going through is normal. You wouldn’t believe how comforting it is to hear that, to know that I’m doing my job right and how I’m feeling is normal.1 cup Entrepreneur, 1/2 cup Swimmer, 1/2 cup Runner, 1 cup Rails developer, 1 cup Cook, 1 bag of Smiles.

Today, we talk to Darren about bootstrapping a startup from more affordable location. Darren is the founder of Certainly Marina! I’m Darren from London and I’m building A variety of factors, but the main reason was financial. I was starting a business and it made financial sense to take my savings from London and use it somewhere in the world that has a cheaper cost of living and good internet access. Doing so has extended my runway by many months and given me time to validate the product.Furthermore, the excitement of exploring new parts of the world, meeting fascinating people, giving myself more time to workout, eat healthier and craft a balanced lifestyle have all played their part. I’m not a fan of working 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for 40 years of my life. I want to work when I want and party when I choose. As an example, just yesterday afternoon I enjoyed 2 hours of bamboo rafting along a river in some of the most beautiful rainforest I’ve ever seen! Did I have to ask my boss for a day off work or phone in sick? Hell no! My decision was pretty easy, but this was partly due to the fact I kept my dependencies in the UK to a minimum… financially and emotionally. I have wonderful friends back in London, but I’m finding it just as easy to make good friends here. Everyone is in the same boat, wanting to hang out and share experiences together.With no exaggeration, euphoric. I think I wrote a I did the travel thing to Thailand over a decade ago so the physical move was smooth. The most important part of my transition was ensuring I surrounded myself with talented, motivated and passionate people who are building ‘cool stuff’. I found the community at Chiang Mai is a haven for Digital Nomad’s. There is a fantastic community of tech entrepreneurs, freelance developers, designers, writers, dropshippers and digital marketers. I was lucky to arrive into Chiang Mai 3 months ago, just before the first Chiang Mai is a great starting point for new Digital Nomads. It has cheap and accessible accommodation, plenty of places to work with a good internet connection and nature is on your doorstep.Just a couple of weeks ago I helped organise what we believe to be as the biggest Digital Nomad meetup ever with 160+ people attending. And last weekend there was a ‘Digital Nomad Summit’ with an attendance of 100+ organised by a crew of volunteers in under 2 weeks.Get here already!There are a bunch of really sweet shared working spots or organised getaways around the world such as Travellers and digital nomads are usually more open, worldly experienced and emotionally mature. This is a great group of people to be discussing my startup with given that I’m building an app to inspire new adventures in the bedroom!Beyond the user research; an extended runway, lots of time to work and less distractions!I haven’t found anything particularly challenging yet, but I’m still in the honeymoon phase!It’s easy to let the days disappear. You need to structure your time, be very clear what you’re trying to achieve and how you’re working towards it. I use Trello and the Pomodoro technique.For me, getting enough (but not too much) social interaction is also important. I’m trying to craft the right balance of meeting new people, nurturing new friendships and doubling down on work. I’m still figuring it out.As a Digital Nomad you should probably thrive in these unknowns! The excitement of exploring a new way of living has drawn me to this lifestyle.Connection to investors, dealing with visa’s, banking etc. Also, working out where to go next… for example, if I know there are a bunch of nomads heading to X location at X time, I may choose to swing by. Can someone build a solution please?Keep that faith and don’t chicken out! Buy the ticket, set the date and it’ll all fall into place. We’re the first generation in the history of mankind with the opportunity to live and work from anywhere we want. The infrastructure is available and flight travel has never been this affordable.The 2 best nomad communities are in Chiang Mai, Thailand and Ubud, Bali. I recommend first visiting one of these places to meet other nomads who are in the same boat as you!With regards to your work, I’d suggest arriving with a focus, otherwise it might be difficult to get going. This lifestyle takes a lot of self motivation and organisation!The wonderfully inspiring people I meet every day. Also, the delicious food and beautiful weather! British food and weather sucks!…. but nothing is going to stop me.UX designer and long term digital nomad. Also, founder of Stories on life, work and travel as a digital nomad by 

So you’re finishing up college, know how to reverse a String, read the trifecta (T.Crunch/H.News/P.Hunt) religiously, and think to yourself, “I should work for a startup”. Fantastic choice! A startup has never failed. You’ll be raking in a cool $82M once your company gobbles up 19 B’s via an acquisition offer and your loser big-company friends will shed a tear each time you send them snap of what early retirement looks like. But to reach this nirvana, you’ll need to survive the treacherous open office jungle that is, a startup. So here’s my advice…Since this startup you’re joining has less than 50 people, you’re going to be in close quarters with a breadth of talent and experience. They will try to put you on the path to career paradise, but shun their futile attempts. And on the off chance assistance is required from a more senior co-worker, always ask them the same question at least 3 times throughout the day.You may think you were hired to inject modern ideas into product and execution, and that’s totally true. But while your voice will be heard in the intimate setting of a startup, seldom use it. Silence is golden and knowledge is power. So when an issue arises, don’t jump in and save the day right away. Wait until the company starts losing money. Only then do you:And if you fancy Prisoner of Azkaban Hermione-like productivity powers, you’ll first need to dump your other tools:- drag and drop Trello to the trashAfterwards, go utilize a tool called “Just Outsource Your Tasks To South Bay High Schoolers”.Startups with funding are new and wealthy enough to invest in their tools. But dev tools were designed for people who are weak, people with their hand out, people who are more You are not one of those people. Brute force every solution. Meticulously follow print statements. Even just type nonsense and see if it compiles. At least your keyboard will always be clacking away which will easily fool any passers-by that you are an extremely efficient/“brain in your fingertips” type of developer.When you look down at your phone and see a request from a coworker, “swipe right”. And no, what the heck?, I’m not talking about Tinder.I’m talking about deleting a Jira or email on Mailbox if it involves you doing more work.And also, don’t listen to this guy’s advice on the matter:Even though startups are constantly iterating, certain testing efforts are crucial for keeping product healthy and key early adopters retained.Due to minimal legacy code, startup’s code bases tend to be squeaky clean. Sounds like an opportunity for you to leave your mark ;).It’ll be like unleashing an army of skunks and chimpanzees to raid Airbnb’s pristine hq for a weekend. Things will get messy, but you will be remembered.And forget “best practices”, it’s a buzzword. Only the raunchiest engineers KISS and shard while at work. Some prefer some nice Object Oriented Programming but there’s a reason why OOP backwards is POO. And finally, don’t stay DRY. And finally, don’t stay DRY.Folks always say this about life at startups, and for good reason. Despite being indoors, always wear a hat. And mix it up. Buy a fedora, trucker hat, beanie, etc. Great advice.Try utilizing the MEAN stack. But not the framework. Simply be mean to others publicly. Pretend like every code you review is shockingly the new worst of all time, be swift to blast blame on your company’s open Slack channels, and in the unlikely event a thank you is legitimately in order, resort to sending just a DM. That way you seem like a nice person while also crushing the lower-downs in front of the higher-ups.sarcasm().stop();Be Spongebob Startup-pants and soak up knowledge from all directions.And lastly, there’s obviously no secret recipe for company success in this land and many articles sound righteous by acting like they have all the answers (like this one). But regardless of what happens to your company in its transition from startup-dom to either big company-dom or extinction-dom, just make sure you’re growing as an engineer while also keeping intact your abilities to think critically, communicate, and be creative and your personal “exit” will be a successful one.racecars, kayaks, palindromes

I sat down yesterday to write job descriptions for a few positions we’re hiring for. Our job descriptions and application process is slightly different than most. We don’t collect resumes. We don’t put developers through a technical review. And we don’t describe ourselves by the perks we give to employees. While writing this up, It got me to thinking: what The boom in start-ups over the last 15 years has marked this new wave in how we portray our companies to prospective employees. Go find just about any startup that’s hiring and there’s likely a “culture” section on the job description that says something like: Free beer on Fridays (well, free beer everyday now)! Massages for everyone! Ping pong on the roof. FREE CHEF CRAFTED LUNCHES WHAAAAT?Don’t get me wrong. I love a free beer while I’m getting a massage while eating a farm-to-table lunch before going back to work (ok that’s never happened to me but I’ve heard stories you guys). And I can whip some ass at ping pong. But this does not a culture make.Culture, or the atmosphere you create at your company, is not something you can easily manufacture. There’s no guidebook that says “Chapter 3: How to make your startup cool as shit”. Great startup culture, in my opinion, is fostering an atmosphere of creativity and empowerment. It’s giving your team the ability to think outside of the box, to find creative solutions to problems, and communicating to your team and prospective team that they’re not just another employee or subordinate but rather an integral part of the bigger picture.Tangibly, we create culture at our The takeaway from this is that I don’t think a list of perks make a culture. That the founders, their personalities, what’s important to them is what will ultimately shape the culture more than anything.(p.s.

A week ago, I set out to build Ahaoho.io. I had a domain name, an idea of the product I wanted to build, and that was pretty much it.So where do you start when you’re creating a startup from scratch? Build a landing page? Write an email to your first prospective client? Start coding? So many things that I could get engulfed into. How could I be sure I wouldn’t just be doing busywork and wasting my time?Eric Ries’ Lean Startup brings a good framework for answering this question. All business ideas are based on what he calls leap-of-faith assumptions. These assumptions are the theoretical foundation of your business : if they don’t hold true, no matter how dazzling your landing page, how clever your emails, or how fast your app, your product just won’t fit its market.Testing these assumptions seems like a good place to start. If they’re right, it’s time to start building the product and test more fine grained hypotheses. If they’re not, well, it’s time to pivot.So what are my leap-of-faith assumptions for Ahaoho? In a nutshell, Ahaoho searches through your app’s usage data to find which of your users’ action correlates the best with them paying for your product. That action is the Aha moment, the point where they realize the value your product is bringing them.Once that action has been identified, you can adjust your user onboarding, lifecycle emails, and product UI to get more users to that Aha moment. As more users experience your service’s Aha moment, more of them see the value in your product, and your conversion rate increases. Hurray!For this idea to turn into a profitable business, a couple of things need to hold true:Once these assumptions are identified, they can be tested by measuring potential clients’ response to a minimum viable product (MVP).So that was the first thing I did. Figure out what that MVP might look like, and define what I would expect for that MVP to be a first validation of my assumptions.Among the different flavors of MVP, I’m going for the concierge MVP: offering a handcrafted version of the product to my clients. They grant me access to their Google Analytics data through a barebones web app, and a week later I send them a report of what actions are the most likely to be their Aha moment.This has two advantages. First, I get to offer a service pretty similar to the one I’m planning on building, but for just a fraction of the work since I don’t have to automate anything. This allows me to avoid wasting time on building something I’m not sure would sell. Second, since I have a week to crunch the numbers, I get to experiment with various models to find out how best to find a reliable Aha moment for each data set.I initially reached out to a couple of friends from various Parisian startups to see if they would be interested in this MVP. Now I have sufficient validation to open up this first version to anyone who would be interested. If you want in, Interestingly, working on this MVP and selling it has lead me to do all the things I’ve mentioned at the top of this article: emailing potential clients, setting up a basic landing page so that their colleagues can find out more, and writing just enough code to allow my first testers to give me access to their data safely and easily. However, the framework of the lean startup has given me the confidence that these haven’t been a waste of time.In the weeks to come, I’ll be able to have some real numbers as to how well this MVP is performing. This will give me some indications as to how well my leap-of-faith assumptions hold up. In the meantime, feel free to come join the experiment and Founder of

In our experience, many early-stage entrepreneurs launch their startups without consulting a lawyer. Lawyers are expensive, after all. Ironically, it almost always costs more money and takes more time to fix legal mistakes down the road.Complying with the law is particularly important for early-stage startups courting investors. But all too often entrepreneurs scare off potential investors with messy legal documentation or impending liabilities and lawsuits.One of the worst reasons for startup failure is making avoidable mistakes. To prevent startups from falling into legal pitfalls, we’ve compiled a list of eight common legal errors made by early-stage entrepreneurs:Ultimately, we recommend getting a legal opinion on important business questions. Many law firms work with early-stage companies through fee-alignment plans or deferred payment plans. Consider these options. And make sure your chosen lawyers are well-versed in the area of law you need help with.(Ad)venture Enthusiast, Startup Consultant, Social Entrepreneur. Passionate about tech, travel + big ideas. How to build a startup

In my immigrant family, I was taught that the only constant is your own output, your own hard work.I hate to ask for help.Regardless of the love and affection from my parents, family members, and teachers, their good intentions were not always consistent. When life is inconsistent, you learn to make things happen for yourself. At five, if I was hungry and my aunt was tired from working the night shift, I would cook my own breakfast. At eight, if my parents had to get to work early, I would walk solo over a San Francisco hill to go to school. At ten, if I needed a book or new color pens, I started a garage sale to make the needed money.But as much as we want to believe in the do-it-yourself ideal, you can only get so far without drawing on your community. Now that my startup is failing because I haven’t asked for help, I’ve learned to:Ask LinkedIn connections for introductions;Be clear about why I am contacting someone;If my “ask” has been rejected, then I try to find out why and what I can do to improve for next time; andPeople are busy. A lack of communication doesn’t mean they Remember, a part of being successful is realizing you can’t do everything yourself.I am frugal!

It is 5:46. I am sitting at the desk in my apartment writing those lines. Why? Because I’ve read somewhere that successful people get up early. I think it was on Lifehacker. Or on the Buffer blog. Or maybe on Techcrunch. It is dark outside, the room is quiet and finally I have some time to reflect on the past 12 hours. What a rollercoaster ride!But let’s start from the beginning. It was yesterday afternoon, when it all started with a tweet. I was working and thought about how much more fun it would be to be at a pool or beach or Justin Bieber concert, instead of in an office and expressed my thought on twitter, where all my almost 10 000 followers (only 7200 to go), were eagerly awaiting my tweets.Yes, it was actually easy. In order to be at a pool, beach or Justin Bieber concert all the time, I just needed to find a way to enable people to pay me for my mere existence. After receiving one fav on my tweet, I saw, that there was huge demand out there in the market. I had identified a huge business opportunity. Finally, it would be possible for my followers, my fans, my tribe, to pay me back for all those years of free entertainment, I had provided. I could literally feel their excitment, as I uploaded my new (free) Wordpress theme and wrote the content for the website/landing page/start up, that was going to change my life and impact the lives of so many people around me. I was about to disrupt the online entertainment industry forever. I knew, that I was working on something big, as I embedded a cat video from YouTube and installed the Paypal Donate button. From idea to MVP and beyond (cat video!!) in one hour. I was impressed with myself. Even Startup Weekend startups need a whole weekend. Even Pieter Levels would be impressed. I rock.Well, after all those draining minutes of having the idea and executing on it, the big moment, I had been looking forward to for minutes was finally here. The launch hour of I was ready. I took a deep breath and hit “Tweet”. Then I waited. For 1 minute and there it was. The first (and only ) Retweet. I’d done it. My PR strategy had worked. I’d gone viral. However, I made a very conscious decision not to start the launch party (go to 7eleven to buy beer) yet. I needed to stay focused. So I repeated on Facebook, what had worked so well on Twitter. The format wasn’t perfect, but it’s the content that counts, right? RIGHT? 3 Minutes go by. No like. Should I have prepared more? Tested before I launched? While I was still thinking about this, I received a Twitter message from an early adopter, who said he had problems with the payment process. I freaked out. Here I was, with customers, that were basically lining up to pay me and I couldn’t process their orders. It was horrible. I put my CTO (myself) to work, making sure she (me) knew, that this was the one and only priority and that she (I) needed to find the bug as quickly as possible in order to not lose traction with our early adoptors. Luckily it didn’t take too long before the problem was solved and I could finally turn to Twitter, where our customers, who eagerly became co-creaters in my endeavor to disrupt online entertainment, started to approach me with ideas, on features, they wanted to see. Their ideas were amazing and my CTO (I) couldn’t wait to implement them.It was also at this time, when I suddenly got the message I’d been waiting for. The first paying customer. I was in shock, happy, sad, excited, amazed, but most importantly I had made 4$. Single digit revenue. I couldn’t believe it! Well, actually I could and I almost picked up the phone to call Dave McClure to let him know I was ready to join 500 Startups. Then I paused though. Did I really need investment at this stage? I mean: Afterall I was profitable after only 3 hours. I had a great product, traction, I had paying customers and I had… And yes. That was the moment, when I noticed that I was navigating a cruise ship in the dark. Kinda like the Titanic. No metrics. I’d forgotten to install Google analytics. Needless to say: My CTO (me) needed to get on it right away.Things were crazy, but I needed a break. it was midnight by then, and as Arianna Huffington told me to sleep my way to the top, I went to bed.I woke up. Had it all just been a dream? Was I really the Founder/CEO/CTO/CMO/CFO/UFO of a startup, that was skyrocketing? I’d made 62$. DOUBLE DIGIT REVENUE. I also had customers on 3 continents. It hit me: I was running a global business. I knew many startups, who hadn’t made 62$ in their first year of existence. It was right not to give up equity too early (the day before), I was confident, that I could do it. One thing was sure: I was on to something big here…To be continued…PS: I would like to thank Eric Ries, WordPress, the Academy and Grumpy Cat, who never stopped believing in me. You’re awesome. Just like me.Hi! im Kathrin and i like to like. Im into marketing, innovation and anything digital. Chocolate is awesome. Travelling and running are too.

Try to name a billion dollar B2B tech company without a revenue model. Even if you don’t dream of 10-digit valuations, Until recently, I found the imperative to develop a sustainable business model was constantly doing battle with the competing temptation to give the milk away for free.Oh sure, I justified this temptation with various pretences:But if I’m being honest, the root cause of the ‘free urge’ was fear — fear of getting pricing wrong, anxiety around rejection, and an unwillingness to commit to What I’ve come to realize, is that prioritizing the ‘pricing conversation’ is the soundest strategy for evaluating your product’s anticipated The pricing conversation can be abstracted to two hypothetical customer questions: 1. Is there ANY price that you would be willing to pay for this product? and 2. If willing to pay, what price would you pay?Now, bear in mind, I have absolutely zero intention of actually asking potential customers these questions.Why?I’m mostly kidding here, but it’s a fairly well understood fact that “Willingness to Pay” surveys are No, instead, we’re using these questions as a window to our product’s soul…This question is the fundamental basis of Inevitably, there is some segment of your target audience willing to say ‘Yes’ at free and ‘No thanks’ when they have to pay you (your mom for example). But you’ve only got so many friends and family; that’s not a long-term business strategy. So feel free to offer free trials and go nuts with freemium tiers, but if you’ve got no idea how to entice some segment of the market to actually pay you for your product, I’ve got bad news:Spending your evenings, weekends, and holidays working on a product that at the end of the day customers aren’t even willing to pay for? That’s banana steaks.*The best way to figure out if you’ve created a product that people truly want or need? Put a price on it. Any price greater than $0 helps to separate the wheat from the chaff and gets you closer to pmf.Once you’ve rejected the alluring siren-call of ‘free’ this is where things get interesting. While you’re absolutely allowed a pricing According to Josh, if you want to avoid going gentle into that good night you must:Take a moment to think about those numbers and what they mean for your product, its pricing, and the value you need to offer. I bet at least one of those metrics gives you pause. For me, it was the minimum ceiling of $100 ARPU. Prior to reading Josh’s article, our anticipated pricing was guided by a) what I thought customers would pay and b) what our competitors charged.In hindsight our first pricing technique seems laughably inadequate. Imagine if Apple started product development by asking themselves, how much will the average person pay for a watch and what do most watches cost?No, the better question is what would my product have to do—who would it have to be—for people to gladly fork over $20, $50, $100, $1000?Church doctrine can be Without diving into Customer Development, suffice to say that in the early days you make educated guesses around value and pricing, and the faster you get it right, the longer you get to live.Once startups convert to the Church of Value-Based Pricing, a critical sacrament (ok, I’m done with the religious metaphors) is to determine their The average B2B SaaS startup charges roughly $67 — $525 per month for a subscription.**At least initially, we’ve decided to literally bind our pricing to our user value. We’ve chosen event-based pricing, taking a portion of the revenue earned from each referral we get our customers. From there, we’ll put together subscription tiers based on various value-adds like widget customization, access to growth metrics, and support.A big potential issue I see with this revenue model? Despite being directly tied to value, this model offers no predictability for us or our customers. A popular solution to unpredictable event-based pricing is to figure out the general distribution of customers and create tiers that align to average use. And, maybe that’s where we eventually end up.But for now, Tapir’s on pricing Rumspringa. You’ll surely forgive us a couple of months experimentation.([A little flesh, a little breath, and a reason to rule all.

Priya is an engineer. After several years of full-stack experience at a number of great medium-sized companies, she contemplated joining a young startup, DataPoodle. Priya felt it had a great mission, team, and mutual chemistry. She called to consult with us about what her compensation should be. To make the right compensation request as a CTO, we needed to know more. Here are some of the questions we asked her to help her understand if this position was the right one, and what she should ask for.We first asked Priya to reflect and understand why she was even interested in a CTO position in the first place. Priya revealed that she had actually set out to create her own company after several years as a senior engineer at large startups. In the process of seeking a business-focused co-founder, she met the founder of DataPoodle, and immediately felt a connection to the product and leadership. They were non-technical founders seeking a technical leader, and she felt this opportunity might be a chance to learn about overseeing an entire product, working with paying customers, and hiring and managing a team.Priya ultimately wasn’t deeply coupled to the idea of starting a particular company. Aside from just writing code, she wanted to build a team, help grow a young business, and execute on her strong sense of ownership. Being DataPoodle’s CTO aligned with this. As a note, most startups who feel they need a CTO generally just need an engineer who can build something — DataPoodle, by contrast, had a “true” CTO role to be filled.We asked Priya whether she felt the founders were fully committed. “Yes” was an easy answer to provide because commitment was implied; their title read “Founder”. When we asked her to elaborate on the basis for that feeling, it was harder for her to express.Founding a company should be viewed as a It is stressful, intense, and the founding team needs to be fully invested in the venture for it to be successful. If a founder is consulting on the side, or has a full time job and works nights and weekends on this project it may be a signal that the company may take longer to succeed. Full dedication We encouraged Priya to reconnect with the DataPoodle founders to make the implied explicit. Did the DataPoodle founders have a strong commitment to the company? Or was it more of a passing experimental side-project? There were no correct answers but there needed to be an empathy for the level of risk each key member was taking.Priya had good chemistry with the founders. But, while chemistry is evaluated, trust is painstakingly built. Priya’s trial with DataPoodle consisted of minor bug fixes over the course of a part-time week. DataPoodle was impressed– they wanted to move forward with a full rewrite of their prototype. But, Priya hesitated to take on more meaningful work without first negotiating a longer term incentive plan.We felt this was a signal that she felt there was too much risk of extending herself without the proper compensation. Priya felt it was possible that even with a title and equity, the role would align more closely to the responsibilities of a senior engineer. Our recommendation was to take more time to work together to see if more trust could be organically built, instead of walking away from the opportunity altogether.Conversely, if it’s going to take Priya too long to build trust — on the order of months — it’s just not going to work out. Startups move too quickly for this.DataPoodle already had an MVP and customers requesting features. A rewrite the prototype to support new features was paramount to customer retention and acquisition. Priya agreed this was the most urgent priority and fell squarely under the responsibilities of a senior engineering role.She was excited by the prospect of fulfilling the role of CTO– someone who would grow and lead a great technical team. More than writing code, she would choose the tools and stacks, define the application architecture, hone a ship-release cycle, and mentor and onboard new engineers. Assuming her rewrite was successful, would the founders next prioritize growth of the engineering team and resources?One suggestion we made was to loosely outline the success metrics for a rewrite and a plan for engineering team growth to see how soon her role could expand to include CTO duties. Bringing clarity to the time beyond the app rewrite would give Priya the confidence they were committed to supporting her as a CTO.Priya had avoided inquiring about the cap table since she wasn’t versed in understanding them. We believed it was imperative that she gain a basic understanding of cap tables so she could objectively evaluate the financial health of DataPoodle. Making a decision without this knowledge could lead to many surprises later.We proceeded to walk Priya through the most important aspects to understand.A Company financials can be complicated, with many awkward terms attached to investment. Many early-stage Priya was unconvinced that she should be prying into the founders’ compensation packages. It seemed too personal until we outlined how the information could be beneficial to making the right decision and making the right request.Indeed, as industry leaders have YCombinator requires everyone with a “cofounder” title Is there large skew in the DataPoodle’s cofounders’ equity grants? Why? If aFinally, we encouraged Priya to first gather answers to all of the unknowns above before tackling compensation directly. When she was satisfied with her answers, we suggested sitting down with the founding team to assemble some spreadsheets of possible outcomes over time to determine the equity ownership expectations.Aside from adding transparency to the process, Priya could interactively understand how her worth is being determined. Additionally, Priya could also gauge whether the founders would be willing to provide fair equity packages to the engineers she would want to attract to be on her team.Some rough notes on numbers:In short, we advised Priya to target a base salary higher than the founders, but below market (~$100k — $150k) early on, and an equity grant anywhere between 6–10%. Another priority for her in this discussion was to clarify the kind of packages the founding team expects to give to subsequent hires as well, and help to define them fairly, since she will have responsibility for growing the team.Priya is in a great situation — she is a senior engineer with experience, is in a place to take risk, and has met a team she has great chemistry with. She came to us for guidance on a formula for worthwhile compensation at an early-stage startup.We could have jumped to numbers outlined in the last section, but we believe evaluation and negotiating a startup offer is far more involved than immediately committing to a base and percentage. If you find yourself in Priya’s position, please ask the following questions before defining your compensation expectations:What are you looking for? How committed are the founders? How much do you trust the founders? How well have you understood and defined your role? What does the company’s cap table look like? What are the founders’ compensation packages?Priya gained a great deal more insight into the relationship between the founders and financial commitments. In the process of asking these questions she gained further confidence in the company and is hopefully on the path to making sure this CTO role is the right one.Thanks to Helping engineers and other tech workers learn their worth, and get what they deserve.Know Your Worth.

We launched the third program in our Entrepreneurial Education Series, “Connecting Corporations and Startups,” on September 24th with our partner 1871 and sponsor The event brought together powerhouse entrepreneurs, corporate venturers, and corporate executives Jacob Babcock (CEO  Co-Founder, NuCurrent), Hardik Bhatt (CIO, State of Illinois), Rob Diebold (Strategic Business Development Manager, Molex), Rumi Morales (Executive Director, Strategic Investment Group, CME Group), Julie Szudarek (SVP, Getaways, Live, and Things to Do, Groupon), and David Weinstein (Founder and Managing Partner, Freshwater Advisors) to share their insights on selling to, partnering with, and garnering investment from corporations.If you missed the event or just want a quick recap, read on for highlights from the discussion.So how do you even make those sales? It all starts with clearly understanding the corporation’s main business pain. If you can figure out what major problem the key C-Level decision-makers are grappling with and how your business can solve it, then you can begin your sales process. As David Weinstein put it, “a quick no is your second best answer because a slow maybe [or no] is the death of your business.” If you spend your time trying to sell a product that doesn’t solve the corporation’s big pain, or you are addressing that pain with the wrong solution, then you’re going to slow down your own sales cycle and hurt your reputation in the meantime.Having a sales team that clearly understands the corporation’s business pain and your startup’s value proposition is also essential to successful selling. Your salespeople are the ones who will use their inroads to target clients and often make the connections that get your foot in the door, so as Julie Szudarek pointed out, “when you’re hiring salespeople, put them through the ringer like mad.” You need to make sure potential buyers are getting your absolute best pitch, and the best pitch, hands down, is one that clearly communicates your value in the context of their problem.On way to make sure your expectations match up is to do your homework on potential partners before you even get into a meeting. Based on his experience at CISCO and now at the State of Illinois, Hardik Bhatt stressed the importance of targeting the right people. For example “If your innovation is for public sector only, it’s going to be long sales cycle. You’ll need a patient corporate partner.” You can figure out who is patient and who is not by leveraging the entrepreneurial ecosystem, talking to former partners, and even having candid (but respectful) conversations with the executives you meet.On the flip side, remember that executives in the same industry also run in the same circles, so they will know who you are and what you’re selling in advance. Cultivating a strong reputation even with corporations that don’t convert into partners is essential to keeping doors open with other potential partners.Across the board, this sentiment applies to all types of corporate venturing. However, not all corporate venturers operate with the same goals in mind. All of the panelists agreed that depending on the corporation, the objective could be a return on investment, access to a new market, opportunities to innovate, or all of the above.Rob Diebold of Molex, NuCurrent’s corporate partner and investor, echoed this point by explaining, “startups can innovate faster than we do,” but the innovation has to be game-changing for both sides, otherwise success is harder to achieve. He added that the relationship with NuCurrent wouldn’t have been so appealing if they’re technology didn’t fit into Molex’s own goals for their products.Jacob Babcock echoed this observation, but from the entrepreneur’s perspective, “capital is not especially grand unless one of the investors [corporate or otherwise] has something critically valuable to contribute.” In other words, just because you’re in a position where you need capital doesn’t mean you should take it from anywhere. Always keep your strategic goals and vision in mind because your investors should be aligned with both.Photo: The largest and most active angel group in the Midwest, #1 Midwest Angel Investment Group

The last few years have seen a lot of If you are looking to create a venture backed business, it is pretty much understood that you need to be able to create some sort of sustainable competitive advantage to be successful over time. Call it a moat or a monopoly, but somehow you need to have a significant aspect of your business that your competitors can’t replicate.In the earliest days of VC, that was usually a deep technical advantage protected either as a trade secret or via patents. Over time other routes have emerged (e.g. network effects, unique distribution channels, scale) and in many cases have come to take the dominant role for most software and services investments.Design can play two main roles in getting a company to a sustainable advantage.The first is as an The second (and perhaps more speculative over the long term) is as an Head of Product, FiftyThree

The Hong Kong startup ecosystem summer 2015After the launch of the Visa scheme for Startups reactions were mostly positive, but sparked also the discussion what else is needed in Hong Kong. In this and the next few posts I will set out, IMHO, which things are “missing” or where we should pay attention to at this point, additional suggestions based on this are welcome. But let me make clear: A lot of discussion is pointing at the government, which is only partly true, the government can make a lot of the changes, but like as in other startup hubs, there is much more what an ecosystem can do itself.(and get it to a least a These 4 items are the basis of a startup, and only number 3 and 4 are more or less ecosystem related.Usually founders start with their startup in the place they already live. Only in a more advance stage they move, usually to the place they “found” investment. Changes in the ecosystem will definitely help, but the start on this point should be from “within” on this. Hong Kong founders are working on this: Divide, 9Gag, Shopline, Gogovan, AfterShip, etc…. Also don’t forget the expat community, from recent 12 founders that graduated from the Founder Institute, one was HK local, 5 were I will talk more about (startup unfriendly) family culture in Hong Kong in later blog posts.Hong Kong has few pillars when it comes to knowledge:But your “problem” isn’t mandatory to be in these spaces, something The ecosystem can have influence on your problem, but it’s a minor factor.I first had my doubts, but having run the Founder Institute last semester I’m sure “we” have great mentors residing in Hong Kong. Maybe not Paul Graham or Now we are getting to a point the government could play a bigger role. There are some good initiatives (some could have a better execution) by the Hong Kong government or affiliated organizations like InvestHK, Cyberport, HKSTP, etc, providing incubators with cheap or free office space, reimbursement schemes and micro-funds. Also the recent launch of the I’ve been saying for some time now that Ground floor: Coffee shop1st floor: co-working space2nd floor: meeting rooms3rd floor and up: bunk-beds / hostel.And is willing to support the ecosystem by running this hub non-profit or against a loss for PR purposes.The reason why is: housing costs. While there are ways in Hong Kong to get cheap office space, co-working space, maker space, lunch for US$5, cheap public transport (the tram takes you from east to west on HK island for only US$0,30) and cheap bars (looking at you 7–11), housing is an issue. I had several interns struggling to find acceptable housing, not mentioning rooms for US$650 with lice, cockroaches and moist. One founding team of 3 I knew rented a 3 bedroom apartment for US$1,300, but it was an hour away from the co-working space and most of the Central focused events. And that was 2 years ago, rent only increased since then.So while “we” don’t have to be in the top 20 (that will only attract wantrepreneurs) there is still one basic thing (housing costs) that should receive help.Let me know your thoughts and if you like this discussion, recommend or share this post to get a broader opinion about the startup ecosystem in Hong Kong.This blog post first appeared on my personal blog here: Founder • Layman (as in definition #2) • Startup Bullshit advocate • 

Advisor compensation questions are common for startups. Here are some considerations:1. Advisor Experience and Influence.2. Stage of Startup.3. Expected Contributions.4. Vesting Period.5. Cash, Equity or Both.Some rules of thumb charts that Be careful of rules of thumb, however. As He points out that:His suggestion is to first figure out what value this person would bring as a full-time contributor, then multiply that figure by the fraction of full-time expected of the person to be involved.Another factor discussed in Likewise, the specific details matter. For example,For startups and advisors, there is also another important consideration…Many startups and advisors don’t realize that there are structures that can optimize incentives.For Their current solution is to wing it, or get caught in legal churn.

I would wake up, get into the office, turn on my computer and ‘bing’, 30 new emails would be in the inbox with various sales questions, technical support questions, and various spam emails and other things to deal with.I found it very stressful and tiring, but it had to be done. I spent hours every day working through these emails, and then when it came time to do some designing or coding it was 2PM in the afternoon and I was tired and hitting my ‘productivity-low-point’.What’s worse is I was getting angry with my customers, being un-professional and fobbing them off.I wasn’t being helpful to my customers and I wasn’t giving them the I heard about Virtual Assistants through Rob Walling’s book — But it was true. VAs exist and they are there to help you.So I signed up to I wanted someone who was based in the US ideally, as they would be on my wavelength. I’d also heard some horror stories about outsourcing to overseas workers and was worried about things like a communication barrier, or them just disappearing for no reason.(I was proved wrong, as you’ll see if you keep reading).I hired my first VA for about $20 per hour. She was very smart and she learned my whole business in about two weeks. After about six weeks she was:She was amazing. In fact, I took paternity leave after about eight weeks and she managed the whole business while I was spending time with my wife and newborn baby. I even got to play a bit of golf!A lot of this was because I got lucky and found someone really amazing and talented. But since working with VAs for a few years, I know it’s possible to find others just like her.After a while, I thought it would be appropriate to raise her rate as she was doing so much for us and had been with us for a while. However, we couldn’t afford to keep paying her for 25–30 hours a week at that rate so we needed to keep her on as a manager and find someone else she could train up, to basically replicate herself.I realized how good she was when we struggled to find anyone who could learn as fast as she could, but she was fortunately a really good teacher and it wasn’t long before she was able to train people up to do what she did (maybe not as well).She ended up writing a training document so that a) I could use it to train new VAs in case she had to leave us, and b) she could easily train new VAs without spending too much money. The document has served us really well, and it’s something I would recommend you do once your VA is working out well.We ended up having two VAs, managed by her. The system worked very well indeed. Even when one of them went on maternity leave, and the other just disappeared off the face of the Earth, our customers were still well supported and the business ran really smoothly.Today we actually only have one full-time VA, and another on standby, and my manager is on-hand whenever I need her. It’s keeping the business expenses very lean, and the customers very happy.I like to make sure my VAs are happy. After all, we’ve invested a lot in training them up, both in time and in money. If they disappeared because they didn’t like working for us it would be a real headache. Therefore it’s good to encourage them often, sing their praises, and reward them with monetary bonuses once or twice a year.They really appreciate this, and it makes you feel good too.A good bonus is probably 10x their hourly rate, twice a year. This can go a long way actually, especially in countries like the Philippines.A little side note about using VAs in far-away lands. I mentioned above I didn’t want to use anyone outside the US. I changed my mind after hiring someone here in the US, and then finding out they had terrible grammar, poor work ethos and didn’t understand our business. The workers we hired in the Philippines and Poland actually spoke amazing English, totally understood the nature of SaaS apps, and were very smart people. It totally changed my perspective on this.To summarize, it’s quite simple. Ask yourself this question:Is it worth $20, $50, $1000 per hour? How much time do you spend doing emails and tasks that someone else (without your level of skill and understanding of your business) could do? How much is a VA?Go to Then you can focus on what you do best; building the business.… or playing golf.Serial entrepreneur. Co-founder of 

A pile of conventional wisdom exists for how to find a co-founder, what that person should be like, and what the two of you should have in common. The answers: find someone a lot like yourself, look first among your classmates and friends, have similar styles, be at the same point in life. Many of the most famous startup duos — Jobs and Wozniak, or Larry and Sergei — seem to fit this outline. But we turned all of this on its head. Bill is 63, I’m 34, and we started a company together.I met Bill when he was the CEO of the company that gave me my second job after grad school. I was a typically overenthusiastic but green and eager-to-learn newbie in the industry; he already had senior leadership positions at a number of companies under his belt and was generous enough to become my mentor. After four years, I changed companies, but stayed in touch, even when my new job took me around the world. I was in India when I found out that he had parted ways with that company after 15 years as CEO; it was a year later when I was in San Francisco that we seriously talked about teaming up to build a consulting firm.A three-decade age gap makes for some interesting situations. I’ve been mistaken for an assistant instead of a business partner. Occasionally, someone thinks Bill is my dad. But we see the differences inherent in our “intergenerationalty” not as bugs, but as features. Here are some reasons why it works:A company can’t get off the ground without excellent connections. For most startups, this means finding mentors and investors who are willing to open doors for you beyond your immediate network.When one of your co-founders has decades of experience in your industry, that experience comes with a strong network of deep, friendly, and proven relationships grown over many years. Only time and experience can build such a network, and Bill has it.On my side, because I came immediately from industry and know many of the younger “rising stars” in our sector, I have a broad network of potential clients, a behind-the-scenes glimpse of what they’re really looking for, and a potential talent pipeline from those who have expressed interest in consulting.Our connections are valuable, different, and complementary — which is a stark contrast to many startup teams where the co-founders run in the same circle, creating the necessity to reach outside for partnerships, customers, and advocates.The day-to-day technology of doing business is very different than it was even a decade ago, even if you aren’t in a tech-heavy industry. Even for the most tech-savvy person later in their career, technology poses a challenge. An intergenerational partnership is one way for an older, more experienced leader to instantly add tech fluency by teaming up with a “digital native.”However, like most of the features of our partnership, this goes both ways. While I’m usually bullish on new tech, Bill points out when the tried-and-true way of doing things can’t be replaced by tech, which also helps keep me grounded and focused on making personal connections that further our business rather than over-relying on technology. Sometimes, you really do have to pick up the phone or jump on a plane, and dazzling graphics can’t make up for weak presentation content.When a startup has a founding team similar in age, background, and goals, the environment can quickly become competitive among the leaders. Unfortunately, a competing co-founding team is the death knell for a startup or small company. While strategies exist for structuring new companies to reduce the risk of co-founders fighting for control or over strategic direction, an intergenerational team prevents competitiveness from the start simply because we’re at such different junctures of our careers. Moreover, instead of creating a competition over who will be in control, an intergenerational team sets a company up for a successful succession plan, which we’ll discuss in more depth.Bill and I have zero situations where we would need to compete against each other because we’re at different places in our careers. We do have a healthy attitude of each trying to bring in more business, but for the good of the whole, not for our individual benefit. Our intergenerational dynamic means that neither of us could ever perceive the other as a threat to getting the outcome that we want from this venture.Succession can almost be seen as the flip side of competitiveness. When you have a co-founding team that looks similar, someone has to be in the lead/CEO role, and then you have to figure out who is going to be the next leader after the company grows, or after the first CEO moves on. In previous startups, we had to discuss whether a co-founder was the right person to be CEO or whether we should hire a leader from the outside. In a mentor/mentee startup team, much like the old model of a parent/child family business, the succession plan is built in, which gives an intergenerational startup more stability for growth than any other model. Unlike teams of similar age where one person is always in the shadow of the other, in an intergenerational co-founding team, there is a clear leader for the present and a clear leader for the future. In fact, neither of us can get the desired outcome for the company and for ourselves as individuals without a successful transition and succession.A mentor and mentee provide excellent balance for one another. An intergenerational partnership provides automatic checks and balances because of our different experiences and perspectives. In our partnership, I’m typically the riskier one; I push more aggressively to consider more innovative products, projects that would be a stretch, working with risky new companies, and trying out unproven methods. Bill is more measured, and reinforces that the “bread and butter” of our business comes from established clients and our track record. Bill and I have a healthy push and pull around these issues, which is great for the health and growth of our business. He keeps me from taking risks that would be unwise or too big, and I make sure we’re still playing the edge as much as possible.When you have two young partners, both are likely to have a high risk tolerance, which could seem like a good thing at face value, but could actually lead to taking the wrong kinds of risks, or too much risk, such as spending too much time on business development and not enough time buckling down and concentrating on product. I’ve been part of or close to startups that grew too fast, hired people on before the company knew that it would be able to keep up with payroll, placed bets on too few customers, or had too many distractions.Working with someone twice or half your age gives you a different perspective. When I see our competitor firms revving up their teams about some “new” thing, I have someone to go to who can point out that the “new” trend happening in our industry is a repeat of something from fifteen years ago, why it is or is not something novel, and why it did or didn’t work the last time it came around. This perspective gives us something that differentiates our firm from our competitors, because it grounds us in a sense of history, pragmaticism, and the real world. Instead of chasing every buzz word, we can focus on the long term arc of our customers and our sector. Bill has experience in what does and doesn’t work, both in the larger industry and within a company, because he’s built companies before and seen all of these trends come and go in various shapes. In a complementary way, I have the perspective of what our clients want now, because I just came from a company that is now our customer. The combination of these two perspectives packs a powerful punch in terms of proving our value.Health innovation, economics, and access / Racing wooden sailboats / Writing / Music / Cancer Survivor / Partner 

This is the second post, from a trio of posts, I’ve written about Hong Kong as a startup hub with a Dutch angle. This post will highlight the logistics part of Hong Kong. One about The similarities between The Netherlands and Hong Kong pre-date startups. Hong Kong is a strong logistical center, it operates a big container port (4th globally), in addition to being driving distance of the port of Guangzhou (8th globally), and Shenzhen (3rd globally). These 3 ports are situated in the Pearl River Delta. The 3 combined handled in 2013 58.8 million TEU.The Netherlands has been the Pearl River Delta of Europe, a de facto port of Europe. Even though Rotterdam, only did 11.7 million TEU’s in 2013. This just goes to show that logistics wise, Hong Kong has a vast history in shipping and distribution.Hong Kong is full of condensed narrow streets (most dense commercial and residential area on planet Earth!), hence micro-distribution is crucial to the city. Many small independent vans swarm the city on a daily basis. From supplying local stores, to grocery delivery (almost every supermarket can home delivery the goods you just bought for a few extra dollars). In a city with a low car ownership this is a thriving business. This is all not including the obvious: the vans are also used for moving larger stuff.It used to be a phone only business (with all language issues included). That market is being disrupted by on-demand van booking startups in the last 2 years.Startups in many colors and levels like Floship, Christopher Moore, Digital Marketing at Where it comes to comparing Hong Kong with other cities, he continues:Max Ward, CEO of Hong Kong is a multi market hub for Asia and the rest of the world, logistics-wise everything is available. And as the incumbents are consolidating, the market will be open for agile and smart startups.Take the B2B accelerator from In the last 4–5 years, I’ve personally seen Hong Kong Startup community grow from one community and one co-working space to at least 7 different communities and 41 oh no, 42 wait, 41 no, 43! co-working spaces. Besides the proximity to China, Hong Kong has great Internet connections. FTTB/FTTH of 1Gb are well covering the most populated areas of the city. You can get around with English pretty well. It has Common Law based on the English laws and “only” max 17% income tax. Staff wise: a fresh grad will cost you Euro: 1,500 a month, office hours are long (9–19 is normal) only real estate is expensive. Getting an office in Central is for 99.99% of the startups unthinkable, beside an virtual office that is. That’s why a lot of startups have offices in Sheung Wan and Quarry Bay if they are not in one of the 43, wait now it’s 44 co-working spaces.

We’re most interested in companies that demonstrate not only capital but operational efficiency — the ability to scale quite far with a small, primarily technical, team. These are companies that can leverage their engineering resources and can achieve exceptionally high user to engineer ratios. These tend to be pure software companies but the business model can take many forms — marketplaces, api-driven businesses, software infrastructure, some consumer apps, etc.I predict most predictions will be wrong, including this rambling set.Consumption will continue to be the default way to kill time (for-ev-er), but I think free-form creation canvas apps could be a nice mini-corrective in favor of more creation.Speaking of wasting time, whoever creates a great time waster app for the Apple watch will not only have a huge hit, but will help rescue the device from the purgatory of “productivity tool” and make the platform attractive to developers again.I hope and believe that password-based logins will continue to go away.While there will continue to be some shakeout among on-demand companies, I expect the influence of the model to spread in the sense of seeing more companies where removing choice is a feature. Instead of DeliveryApp providing 200 restaurants and 6,000 menu items, something like Arcade texts you a single lunch menu item at 11am and your choice is limited to yes or no, or instead of browsing and evaluating hundreds of listings and reviews to choose a service provider (lawyer, babysitter, tutor), you get a single match based on your needs and schedule.I hope and expect the proliferation of new open source databases and stream processors will continue, inspired by interesting work and research in distributed systems.I can’t speak to funding, but there are a few areas. We need more providers of high quality, original mapping / GIS data. I also continually hope for an effective alternative to the slash and burn of the recruiting industry. Security companies that don’t feel like they’re selling snake oil and are actually useful are cool. While we’re just making shit up, maybe even alternatives to the funeral industry.Generally speaking though, I would love to see more highly technical infrastructure companies being built in New York.A weekly newsletter of ideas that investors, companies, and influencers would like to fund.

The story of In our hunt for iOS talent we searched every nook and cranny of the developer landscape. We interviewed 20 freelance iOS coders fielded from headhunters, connections, oDesk and LinkedIn. We met with countless development shops, both local and international. We spoke with potential full-time hires or partners, most demanding salaries in the $200k range and equity in the 40% range. Finally, we began exploring the world of development bootcamps, and we met some really smart graduates. Thoroughly impressed by the caliber of student coming out of these academies, we went back to our network to discuss the implications of hiring such a junior coder to run our front-end. A friend and seasoned tech vet, Randy Burgess presented the idea of hiring one of these junior coders to work in conjunction with a development shop — essentially continue his or her education but in a very After speaking with several dev shops and bootcamp grads, we narrowed our sights. One of the bootcamps on our radar was Mobile Makers. Several Chicago techies had mentioned Mobile Makers as a reputable academy, and several Chicago companies hired Mobile Makers alums that were thriving as employees. Through personal connections, we heard that Eight Bit Studios was a top-notch mobile-specific dev shop, so we sat down with them. Shortly thereafter, we learned that Don Bora cofounded both Eight Bit Studios and Mobile Makers, and while most development shops scorned the idea of a Junior iOS Developer sitting in with them, Eight Bit embraced it. “Hell, we’ll even help you pick the best one.” If personal connections got us in the door, Eight Bit’s commitment to educating and learning sealed the deal for us.

I realized after reading this that reading other startups’ (anonymized) rejection emails can be one of the most powerful companions for early-stage entrepreneurs! There is power in feeling the collective struggle when wading through uncertainty. Very helpful.MisterMedici’s Musings.

To balance the endless onslaught from ever accelerating innovation, limited partners who traditionally invest the bulk of their money in later stage funds are increasingly While private equity, with more than $2,5 trillion in assets, has been basking in the low interest-rate environment of the post-financial crisis era, venture capital has meanwhile built enough clout so as to start a digital snowball that is about to reach escape velocity. By pumping billions of dollars into early startups, venture capitalists have helped reimagine business landscapes from the financial industry to transportation. And “old money” is starting to take note.So why is private equity scrambling for early stage? Although they are often perceived as representing the same investors, venture capital and private equity are different at the core. In simple terms, private equity may be categorised as conservative, while venture capital is liberal (see table by Victor Hwang). The inherent inertia, and the fact that they’re because of fund size forced to invest with tickets more than ten times larger than venture capitalists, is preventing private equity from As a result, Nordic startups may soon find themselves in the the middle of a perfect storm with three prevailing tailwinds, where 1) U.S. venture funds will look for value outside Silicon Valley, 2) foreign limited partners start investing in local venture capital funds and 3) private equity players start scrambling for early stage technology.This perfect storm, even without all of its components, is making Nordic early stage investing safer relative to private equity players which are struggling with their portfolios of incumbents.

The last job offer I received was at an ad agency. Naturally, I was skeptical. I luckily had a friend who had a friend who worked there once, and I was warned right away that the boss was verbally abusive, the hours were horrendous and the work was mind-numbing. That friend of a friend (who I’ve never met in my life, mind you) possibly saved me from months of being miserable. Recruiters are not the only ones looking for the ‘right fit.’ I may be desperate for a job, but I’m also pretty darn desperate to hold on to my dignity by actually working in a company that I won’t eventually hate.I’ve been doing job applications for about a year straight now, living the dream.Besides, if a candidate really wants a job, they’re expected to do their own research on the company, right? Bear in mind though that a company’s website exists primarily to drum up business; not to address the personal concerns of potential staff! Unless you know someone on the inside, there’s not much you can do to gather the information you really need without crossing some uncomfortable lines. There’s only so much information one can squeeze from the receptionist.Since I don’t have a friend of a friend for every occasion, a year of job hunting has turned me into James Bond when it comes to job adverts, trying to discern what I can from cookie-cutter LinkedIn profiles and partial Facebook pages. I kid you not, I even Google Image company managers to try and see in their eyes if they’d be pleasant to work with. My methods are far from scientific. Until now.A couple of weeks ago, a start-up called CareerLabs came across my CareerLabs provides inside information on about 70% of US companies, revealing dynamics like employee-rated Here was all this info, good, bad and in-between, just sitting here for me to peruse in peace! Rather than being yet another professional networking tool, CareerLabs functions as a job hunting aid, allowing you to sign up using your LinkedIn account. It’s not a job board either, but it connects you with job-posts from hundreds of existing job boards.I got in touch with co-founder and CEO, Anthony Van Horne, for a quick chat about CareerLabs’ big picture plan for the job search industry. For one thing, CareerLabs wants to meet the needs of the job-hunters who require the most insight:And it doesn’t stop there.CareerLabs is compiling over fifty years of civil court data to determine just that to give their users accurate and realistic ideas of company cultures. (Oh, snap.)As a Trinidadian, I had to ask Van Horne about CareerLabs’ long term plan for international applicants. He knows that simply flocking to multi-nationals is not a fool-proof plan. Sometimes, companies may promise work visas that they never deliver (even after you receive your contract in the mail and extend the lease on your apartment… but I’m really trying to let that one go). CareerLabs is helping users avoid such uncertainties.Van Horne also knows that workers in general want international flexibility. His team is currently collecting info in Canada and the UK.I was happy to hear they also want to help But the benefit goes beyond millennials. CareerLabs also has filters for Retirement Plans, Health Benefits and Training; key info for older workers;It’s great news considering growing concerns about age-diversity, particularly in tech (I hear you, Pretty cool stuff, right? But how reliable is all this data?But bringing this level of transparency and insight to the corporate world is a marathon, not a sprint. It’s a work in progress, with much more for users to look forward to.CareerLabs demonstrates the same kind of transparency they advocate for: sample numbers can be seen for some company survey results.

Venture Capitalists play a fundamental role in making your startup evolve into a company. A significant part in this process is played by the money you would be acquiring through them. Hence they have a major role to play in your success. For each person, the experience of meeting VCs will be different, yet there is a general frame of questions that they all ask.It is very important for your company to have a vision in place. You should also have a rough guideline on how you would reach your goals. They may ask you ifyou’re in for the long haul or you’re just wait for a lucrative buyout after building it. They would also like to know your strategic plans to grow your company.In poker terminology, it’s like asking if the table is hot enough. The VCs want to know how fast do they have to move in as investors and how many other investors you are talking to. They would also like to find out how important they are to you. You may try to deflect this question, but these are trained professionals with the potency to read with the lines.Here they want to hear terms like, “Committed” and “From a long time”. Even if you are the Einstein’s child or a business prodigy, without a dedicated team you will not be able to win over your VCs. The team is really important even from a valuation perspective. If the team is weak, it automatically translates to founder being weak. VCs won’t be running the firm, you will and it becomes really important for them to know that you can.Be a little honest here because it’s obvious that your VCs have done their homework. Name your nearest competitors but sell the VCs on the basis of your team and something unique that only you have. It maybe intellectual property or a copyright. Show you passion because that is a big gun in your arsenal and your product’s potential.VCs also like to invest in products in an established market. For the purpose of an example, twitter carved out a market segment even through Facebook was an already established platform.You will have to be really careful here, you do not want to overvalue or undervalue your company. Its much better not to showcase a specific amount of valuation early on and perhaps take the curve ball saying. “We will see what the market says”. Sometimes they would be hard pressed to know about your valuation expectation, but it is wiser to generate interest towards your firm and then let the market make the valuation. However, be clear on how much capital you would want to raise.We hope that these points help you towards having a successful meeting with your VC’S.Attempted my hand in a few business ventures.

I recently spoke to Michael Puriz, Senior Business Strategist at Michael didn’t go straight into the startup world. He studied Business Economics at Witten/Herdecke University before working as a consultant. He spent two years as a consultant, a time he describes as “very interesting but also very intense.”“I learned a lot about how companies work. But I was away five days a week. It just wasn’t my lifestyle,” he says. “Different things were important to me.” So a change was in order. Michael’s next move was to Rotterdam, where he studied for a Master’s degree in Strategic Management. His course included some emphasis on entrepreneurship and when it was finished, Michael decided to “go and explore startups.”He tells me: “I didn’t want to go anywhere else. I wanted to work in a startup.” That startup ended up being Applift (part of the HitFox Group), where he joined a new Strategic Partnerships team, which he ended up leading for a year, before recently joining LOVOO.As at Hitfox, Michael joined a newly-formed department at LOVOO, something he was very excited about. The new department is focused on monetising their app through direct advertising deals with brands. He tells me: “I can really shape the strategy and course of not only my department but also the company as a whole.”“I have a very interesting role,” he continues. “I am very close to decision makers in the company.”It’s not just the job itself that Michael likes, though. He is enthusiastic about LOVOO’s culture, too, telling me: “People just treat me with respect. The way I would want to treat other people.”For Michael, to some extent “a startup is just another company.” He doesn’t necessarily buy into the startup label and what it has come to mean to many people — things like free food and ripped jeans. He does see a difference in the way startups can operate, though.“A startup has nothing to lose,” he says. “If you fail, you fail, but at least you learn something. Established companies have something to lose.”“Startups have a goal, they have a vision, they are very ambitious, and they will do anything necessary to achieve their goal.”He also talks about how that impacts him: “It gives me the room and freedom to act in a way that’s beneficial to both me and the company. The company stands above everything.”He returns to the idea that startups try, sometimes fail, but always learn: “I always try to learn through the actions I take. That’s the goal of everyone in a startup: to learn.”Michael knows one of our founders personally from his time at HitFox, but he’s not sure if he found out about StartupCVs directly from him or through another person.“At some point I just came across this name, so I went to the website and checked it out,” he tells me. He likes that you could submit a speculative application to a company with one click and remembers thinking: “This is the quickest way to get my CV to the responsible HR person.”I ask him how he ended up at LOVOO and he tells me: “That’s a bit of a funny story because we kind of contacted each other at the same time. So it was really a mutual interest.”He then had an interview and came away with a great impression, saying: “We just spoke. We had one long interview where we just sat and spoke for two hours. About the job and the world and everything.”Michael demurs when I ask this; he doesn’t like to give one-size-fits-all advice.“I can only look at it from my own perspective,” he says. “I don’t want to tell people how they should be or what they should do.”I ask him instead what he thinks was important in his own job search, maybe there’s something for others to take away from that.“I needed to understand what I actually want,” he says, referring to his move from consultancy to the startup world. He says it’s key to consider what area of business interests him, whether that’s the function he performs or the sector he works in. After that, he (or you) can look around and decide which company is the best place to do that.“Be very clear about the goals you have and then choose the startup that can help achieve those goals,” he says. By doing that, you can automatically show your passion.“Everyone has their own story, so I don’t like to generalise too much. But find a company that is great at marketing, if that’s what you want to do. Or has a great product. They want to see that you have passion and an interest in the startup.”Like Loading…Online marketing guy. Currently producing content for StartupCVs is a recruiting platform for startups.

I have a lot of people ask me this question.Okay, maybe that last part is me. Startups are hard. They’re fraught with danger. They’re chaotic. They could implode at any moment. You have to do everything yourself. Cash runway is a ticking time bomb. Investment markets are drying up. Bubbles poppin like bottles used to! You’re hanging on by a thread until you reach product-market fit then you’re hanging on by a different kind of thread.Here’s my answer.If you’re really passionate about the problem you’re solving, the things you’re working on each day, and the people you get to do it with, then it shouldn’t matter how big the company is, because it won’t feel like you’re working.But, if you join a new Seed Series or Series A startup you’re taking on almost the same amount of risk as the founders but without even close to the same amount of upside. If you’re employee 3 through 10, you’re only getting a few percentage points of equity while the founders are splitting probably 30% each. And the odds are forever against you, with something like a 99% chance of failure.So, that logical brain between your two ears should tell you to not be one of the first employees of someone else’s company, but rather to start your own and raise some capital.A large, multi-national corporation on the other hand holds different benefits and risks. You’re protected, you have a safe salary, but very little chance to increase your compensation much over the years. You have processes and direct reporting lines to follow. You paint a panel on a very large ship and no matter how well you paint that panel, it’s unlikely that anybody notices or cares. But you’re “safe”. Until a downturn and layoffs come.So, it comes full circle back to my original answer. Namely, you must be fascinated by what you do. You must enjoy the journey and the process of the work you do. Otherwise you’ll be searching for something that doesn’t exist, is full of risk, and makes you unhappy.Because logically, no matter what you choose, you’re making a crazy decision. Unless you choose for the basis of learning something you couldn’t have otherwise, working with people you couldn’t have otherwise, or working on something you couldn’t have otherwise.There’s your sign.— SeanBuilding video products for humans Human Behavior, User Philosophy, Neuro-Emotion, and Artificial General Intelligence, for Entrepreneurs.

Make many IDEAS, not only ONE IDEA for STARTUPS昨日は慶應義塾大学ビジネススクール(MBA)で伝説のベンチャーキャピタリスト村口和孝さんの持たれているアントレプレナーシップのクラスにて、30分ほどの短い時間ではありましたが講義をさせて頂く機会を頂きました。村口さんは日本最初の独立系ベンチャーキャピタリストであり、DeNAやインフォテリアなどの初期投資家として知られる方です。約3年前、Skyland Venturesを始める直前2012年7月くらいにも同様の機会を頂いたし、確か毎年一度は同じように講義の機会を頂いています。今回の驚きは、MBAの学生達からの質問がここ3年の講義をさせて頂いた中で最もたくさん出たと言うことです。これはスタートアップへの関心度が上がっていることも一因としてありつつ、村口さんに聞いてみたところ講義のやり方を変えたとのことが大きいのでは無いかとのことでした。私が講師として参加した講義ではアントレプレナーシップのクラスなのでクラスの参加者が事業計画を書いてプレゼンをすると言うことを例年されています。今年からプログラムを変えたポイントは-例年:1個の事業計画を深堀りして作り上げる-今年:5個程度の事業計画を作り、それぞれを考えてみて、良いものを最終発表するとしたと言うことだそうです。その結果、クラスの生徒達がよりアクティブになったのでは無いか？とのことでした。これは私の経験から考えて、とても賛成で、創業してまだプロダクトの無い起業家とも日々接するのですが、まさに幾つも試していくことの良さを感じます。それによって感覚が敏感になる。一方、１つのアイデアを深堀りすぎる場合、そのアイデアが非常に市場性がある場合は収益や組織、インサイトなどが積み上がりますが、そうでない場合は、視野が狭い形になってしまうケースがあり得ます。まさにそれと同じかのように感じました。加えて村口さんは事業計画を完成させるにあたり下記の３+1のポイントが必要と唱え、各プレイヤーへインタビューを行い、それを５つの事業計画を検討する段階でやるとのことをクラスのメンバーへ落とし混んでいるとのこと。(3+1のエコシステム by NTVP 村口和孝)1.顧客 どのように使う2.取引先 サプライチェーン。そもそも仕入れて作ることが出来るか3.販売協力先 どのように売るか4.人と金 従業員や投資家を巻き込めるかたまたま相談があったもので、こんな裏話を2日連続お会いする機会を頂いたため、お話を受けて非常に有益な時間でした。村口さんのお誘いは全てお受けすることにしているのですがこの度はありがとうございました。Living on Youthful Days.

A friend asked me recently what tools do I recommend when it comes to productivity/collaboration? first products that came in mind are Trello and GitHub, but I was curious what are others using? is there something better? so I asked some people.Below you can find 7 bundles of products that do the job and some tips on maximizing their value:Honorable mentions:Other: Please comment and let us know if you have any tips and tricks.

Understand the neighborhood and the people living around. Go to places doing well, go to places not doing well, observe the busy timings and try all the different drinks. You must understand and feel one with your customer. Then select your place’s cuisine with diligence, start with your one specialization make sure it’s top notch. If possible, start with a Minimum Viable Product, that is put up a small food stall in the area, maybe at some festival, maybe move a food truck around with just 2–3 products. Talk to every customer, get feedback and learn more about your product and your customer.When setting up your place apply Design Thinking. Every single decision you make is a design decision, EVERY DECISION. So, carefully curate your place complementing your food, your customers and your style. Picking the color, the art, the music, the utensil sizes; all should be able to be justified with a good design and usability reason. All your decisions will reflect in your place’s ambiance.Every single hire is important from head chef to the cleaner. Find people with passion, belief in your ideas, friendly attitude towards customers and love for your place’s food.Apply analytics from day one. Keep track of your orders, what product sells most and what doesn’t sell much. What products do you people order together? After a careful analysis of your data, you should get a very clear understanding of the customer and you can start thinking of new products, combination offers and what products to remove from the menu.Start experimenting. Experiment with new products, offers and design decisions. Have a clear idea of what you are experimenting, know your assumptions beforehand. Failure/success of your experiment should only lead to validated learning. You are basically testing your assumptions and the learning process will help you test more assumptions in future.Get creative with your marketing strategies. Get in the head of your future customers, who do not even know about your place. How do they decide where to go? Use social media to full power and drive your SEO high. Maybe have customers vote on a new theme/flavor/product of the month. Maybe have a secret menu.Innovate everyday and try to harness the power of technology. There are tons of startups solving problems like taking money, sharing bills, online receipts, online menu, online everything. Think carefully if they match your place’s style and make your customer’s life easier and employ the necessary.If you feel these ideas make sense, you should read

I’ve had this opinion piece in mind for a while now, and thought it time to let it run free in the wild. Take a read, love it / hate it and give me your two cents worth!I’ve seen discussions around this play out as follows:OK…ok.. So it’s a little more dramatic and senseless than the every day startup / investment journey. But in a nutshell, that discussion keeps happening.Startups feel beaten down, and investors feel..well disbelief. It really hit home for me whilst I was watching the panel discussion this week at In my mind, it’s this part of a Startup’s journey that is the tipping point for innovation in any ecosystem — Having the right people around you during Execution is critical. To believe in you when you question yourself. To get you to think outside of the box when you’re fixated on a singular outcome. To make you question yourself when you’re being blind. Those support points are what helps you through some of the most difficult decisions you’ll have to make.I say: build your network, find the people you trust, leverage people’s experiences / knowledge and steer yourself through the storm, it’s sunny on the other side.I’d love to hear what’s worked for you? What was essential for you during Execution of your Startup? Where did you get your support? What helped you make the right choices? Write me a response, let’s hear your thoughts.Co-Founder of 

This guide was Before we get into the large number of warning signs it might be time to leave a startup company let’s first set some expectations. All startups have problems — 90% of all startups fail and even the successful ones tend to hit multiple “near death” events along their path. It is at least to some extent the duty of a startup employee to know the challenges before going in and not bail on a company before they’ve given it a chance to correct course.A decision to leave your startup ultimately comes down to balancing your belief in the company against the myriad of problems you’ll face. If only a couple problems below sound like they’re a match, over-communicate and get them fixed. If you resonate with a large number of the warning signs below, the writing might already be on the wall.Our coaches at When you work at a startup you should know how many total outstanding shares there are. Heck, you should know these numbers before signing an offer letter, else you don’t know the % equity you were granted! If the financials are under strict lock-and-key, that’s a warning sign there is something to hide.Good, so you know how many shares you have and how many are outstanding? Make sure you get updates when the company goes through funding rounds! Most companies that perform well should be able to raise money When Founders Fund raised money, they set a hard deadline for their investors: tell us tomorrow or you’re not in. They raised a billion dollars and were able to do it because investors wanted in so badly. When a company is “stuck” in fundraising mode, that means the fundraiser is having difficulty. The average seed round takes ~2 months to close while the average Series A can take 3–5 months. If your company is always in fundraising mode and you’re not closing impressive investors, the money might be running out!The goal of a startup is to find a reproducible, scalable business model. If a large amount of money is exiting the company but growth isn’t being hyper-charged by it, that might be a warning flag. Eventually overspending leads to having to raise more money before it’s ideal, which leads to the things above… heavy dilution, indefinite fundraising mode, etc.Some startups say “we’ll worry about making money later”. That’s ok as long as 1) you have a good plan to make money later, 2) your user growth is stellar, and 3) your investors like that your user growth is stellar. If the plan to make money is unclear, you might be building a house of cards. Product/Market fit is fragile and many times core product functionality must change to monetize the business. If the free nature of that core product function was a key aspect of the market fit, then companies can end up in hot water.Unit economics — the business efficiencies of handling a transaction or customer — are often overlooked by startups. It’s so bad in fact that Sam Altman, President of YC wrote aThe importance of talking to your users Startups are all about growth or the promise of future growth. Later stage companies can get away with less, but seed stage should aim for more — people say roughly 10% week over week in one primary metric. If you don’t know your week over week growth and people don’t care, that’s worrying.Rocketship companies spread quickly because they built something 10x better than anyone else. When you build something that good, people tell their friends about it and you grow. This is referral-based growth — aka “organic” growth. If you have to pay people to use your product it’s probably not sticky. There is a single exception here, and that is if your unit economics are healthy: spending $20 to acquire a user is ok if, on average, they pay you back $30 within a couple months.These are all too easy to mix up but lead to startups chasing their tail — they think they’re onto something, but it’s not reality! Obviously dangerous. Make sure assumptions are scrutinized and tested. After all, when you learn something and are confident in that learning, it’s a great feeling.Startups only live when the team is working together efficiently. The foundations for an efficient team are a clear roadmap and shared feeling of ownership. A roadmap is made clear when it is communicated properly and areas of difficulty are discussed. In all too many situations, people fail to communicate and hit roadblocks that could have been avoided. When companies fall behind, management tends to get nervous and start setting completely unrealistic expectations.Life is too short to not build something you believe in. If you think you’re building a clunky piece of software or that the design is terribly off, it’s probably worth your sanity to move on. This point is also important for your future career: when people look at your old work, you want them to see something of quality. Every moment you’re building something less than your capability, you’re selling yourself short.This is the slipperiest slope of them all! All C-level “executives” should display strong leadership skills. You should enjoy working with them and feel like you’re learning when around them. Everyone has their weaknesses, but all too frequently startup employees will underestimate the importance of having a strong CEO. If your CEO tends to make you cringe, misrepresent the product, or display a lack of vision — run!When one person isn’t pulling their weight, they should know it and fix it. When multiple people aren’t pulling their weight, you have a systemic problem with your culture. Cultural problems are extremely difficult to solve. Even the best COOs and inspirational CEOs struggle to fix ingrained habits. Viral laziness is probably the deadliest of them all since it stems from a lack of respect or self-motivation.Although Silicon Valley tends to think of meetings as the epitome of evil, they can certainly be productive. You just have to have the right amount of them and talk about important things. This seems like common sense but when people call meeting after meeting, discuss the same things over and over, or change strategies repeatedly, efficiency suffers greatly. This issue can be resolved if operationally-minded people address is and put in structure for decision-making, but all too often employees treat it as an unsolvable issue.Although obvious, this one stealthily creeps into startups over time. Deadlines only have meaning if people take them seriously. This warning creeps in 1) by people joining the company with an already lax stance on deadlines or 2) by deadlines being missed over and over until people become numb. When you accept failure, in a way you’ve already quit on your company.Startups deal with tens of problems daily. They stack up quickly if they’re not solved promptly or triaged effectively. If you’re dealing with the same problems over and over again, not only is the team unable to actually solve it, but there’s also a growing mound that’s lurking in the shadows.No on can succeed and solve highly complex problems by themselves. It’s surprising how quickly politics can enter a startup’s culture: when one person gets successfully outmaneuvered or “stabbed in the back”, other people start thinking they can do the same.If your boss is the C-level and isn’t taking the time to understand you, that’s weak leadership and you can refer to #8 above. If your boss is not, then it’s unlikely they’re getting proper mentorship or coaching to become a better manager. Most managers aren’t very great and if you complain, you’re putting yourself directly in a line of fire. That being said, talking to your boss frankly and letting them try to resolve the issue is a good option before throwing in the towel.If you’re not having fun at your startup, you’re doing it wrong! Startups are supposed to excite you. By being at a startup, you’re sacrificing stability for the sake of freedom and a higher rate of learning. If you find neither freedom or the rate of learning fun, you’re not meant for startups. If your love for freedom  learning is overpowered by your fear of failure, you’re probably in too early-stage a startup.There are many engineers who end up taking startup jobs that use outdated stacks and technologies. If you take a job working on PHP/Zend right now, you’re not optimizing to land a great engineering job 3 years from now. Top engineers in the valley just don’t work on PHP very often anymore. React is an example of something to learn right now. Companies are gobbling up engineers who develop in React. Learning new things not only shows that you’re nimble, but also that you’re passionate!You should be confident enough in your company to make your friends come onboard. If you’re hesitant and don’t think they could handle the culture or number of broken things, perhaps you’re putting yourself in their shoes. It’s odd how many people ignore this warning in their own thoughts.Hey — the world’s not going to end if you don’t get all of those things done this week, right? Technically the world will likely be ok, but if you’re at a startup and have this mentality, you could have it way better somewhere else. Find a place where you’re so passionate you feel like you want to be productive. Find a place where you want to impress your co-workers and get things done!“Market” value is a bit hazy. Startups are unlikely to offer you 160k the way Google or Facebook do, but it’s illogical how many good engineers accept salaries below 75k. Startups that make these low-ball offers will attempt to hype up their equity packages as magical entities of cash creation. Don’t fall for it. In a seed stage company, assume your equity is going to be worth something minimal and take the job because you believe in the mission. Stock is usually given in the form of options. That means you have to The back of your mind saying “Oh wow, that one company’s software looks so cool. I wish I could work on something like that.” You can! Go apply to that company instead.Everything is subjective and no company is alike.

This lack of understanding struck me. Moreover, they expected themselves to be a stereotypical internet user that would be representative of this new market that they never worked in.It is never a good idea to take yourself as representative when you want your business to grow. A safer solution might be to focus on data and analytics. Especially, when entering new territory.Europe certainly is diverse. Also when it comes to digital literacy, internet usage, consumer behaviour, languages, and expectations from users. Even within countries.For instance, Flamish (Belgium’s North) internet users are a more advanced than their Walloon counterparts in the South. The Flamish are earlier adopters, are more experienced, and access English language websites or apps. Whereas some Walloon users might still hope for a Minitel comeback and tend to believe clickbait links.Europe has, according to Wikipedia, ±50 countries. The borders of these countries have often shifted over the centuries. Countries have been conquered, destroyed, lost, and rebuilt. Some are part of the European Union, others are not. There was not one country or city everyone gravitated towards. Brutal regimes have plagued some, whereas others have enjoyed relative peace. Some countries don’t recognize each other, while others are BFF’s. All of these and more (geo)political or historical aspects have to be taken into account when expanding to new markets within Europe.But let’s get back to a Growth Hacker’s perspective.All these different countries (and some regions) have their own cultures and habits. This is noticeable in their digital behavior. As you have seen in the somewhat exaggerated example of Belgium.Therefor, you need to optimize your product for your new markets. This goes beyond changing measurements from centimeters to inches or changing currencies on your website. Every aspect that affects the user experience is up for re-evaluation: UI, colors, text, language, funnels, etc.Even your value proposition or positioning could change: what might be affordable in one country, is not necessarily the case in another. Quick example: €500.- a month for a one room apartment is cheap beyond comparison in London, but part of the higher segment in Poland. This could also be the case for your SaaS company, webshop etc.The threshold that stops a lot of European startups to successfully scale to the USA is that American consumers behave as if they have already seen and done everything. This means that if a startup does something completely new in its country of origin, it might not be anything new to the US market, or not enough to get excited about. But if a startup does something new and revolutionary for US standards the reception is generally very welcoming.Besides being more difficult to charm American customers it is also more expensive to advertise on social media or search engines. Whereas a lot of B2C companies in Eastern Europe are talking about Euro cents, in the US a click might cost several Dollars.A lot of the same variables might need to be examined when entering the American market as when expanding within Europe. With one large exception: text is far more important. Whereas Europeans are lenient to typo’s or faulty grammar, Americans are not and expect to be addressed in the catchiest way possible.All of these optimizations are crucial and should be done as soon as possible. Remember, the acquisition cost for someone with a failed previous experience is twice as high as a new user with no previous experience with your company. This is not an issue if the acquisition cost is 15 euro cents, but it is a problem if user acquisition costs are 12 Dollars.But the main reason they don’t succeed to scale is because European startups fail to recognize that they have to confirm to the rules and expectations of the new market they are entering.-P.s.

Much has been said about the stress that startups put on the mental state of their founders and employees. To have “demons”… This is a statement typically associated with artists, but is just as important for anyone who is compelled to be creative in any form.Product designer and resident metalhead

By Sam Altman, Simplified By, Matt HamlinSam Altman wrote an excellent piece on how to start a startup titled the Startup Playbook. In the article he included most of the advice that would be taught to new YC and YC Fellowship members. I decided to take out the core values from each part of this article and make them available as quick reads for someone who wouldn’t want to read the entire post.Sam breaks down his post into four key areas that founders should focus on in the early days, the first is a killer idea, the second is having a great founding team, the third is having a great product, and the fourth is great execution.Answer the following as clearly as possible:Find the Other questions you should be able to answer:Key Takeaway: The next important step in starting a great startup is the founding team.Ideally you want two types of founders (Prioritize people you Best to worst case scenarios:Key Takeaway: The best cofounders are those people you already know really well.This is everything, anyone can have a great idea and a great set of founders, but only some make a great product.This should be your focus every day while working on your startup.You want to make Build a If you are sluggish growing, focus on the product not the sales.Key Takeaway: The product rules all, build a great product and keep focusing on improving that product in every way possible.The final area of distinction is the execution of the startup. This stage is broken down into 7 individual steps.Prime directive of great execution is Set Don’t only focus on one single KPI (Key Performance Indicator) such as signups, retention is as important as user influx.Don’t start doing the next thing until you have There is What a CEO should be doing:Focus on being Hiring is the The people you want to hire, can be starting their own companies, so be generous.Value Try hard to have everyone in the same office.Finally, Only worry about a competitor that is beating you to market with a better product.

What is the first memory that comes to mind when you think back to the days of your adolescence? Do you ever think back to that time in your life when your parents had executive roles in the household? Maybe your mom was a stay at home mom, or maybe your mother worked full time. Do you ever just recall those days, now as an adult, and internally applaud the women in your life for somehow managing to raise children, take care of a home, and perhaps do all of this while working full time? I most definitely do.I remember my mother doing all of the cooking and cleaning, while raising two little girls, while my father worked 40+ hours a week to make ends meet. I remember my father coming home from work every night, falling into his chair, cracking open a beer, and zoning away all night in front on the television. He would sit there for hours, and we all respected his space and his quiet time because he worked SO. DAMN. HARD. But thinking back, even when my mother was working full time, and caring for us kids, there were no breaks for her.She did all of the cleaning. She did all of the cooking. She bathed us, fed us, and read us our bedtime stories. She had no relaxation chair, and no quiet time. This seems to be a common narrative amongst most families that have two working parents. Since the beginning of the suburban middle class, the man has always been the breadwinner. He would come home to a hot meal, a warm towel ready for his shower, and his favorite shows.When my mother came home from work, she prepared that hot meal, threw those towels in the dryer, and gave up her television time so she could get the kids ready for bed. The executive household roles may have changed, but the patriarchy is still going strong.In today’s society it is totally normal for a woman to work full time and raise children. In fact, 69.4% of families in 2014 had a mother who worked outside of the home. These are married women, with children, whose husbands work as well. These women report working anywhere from 10–60 hours a week, while also caring for their homes, and their children. I can’t seem to find any stats on women who own a business. I have found about 15 studies referencing fathers who are c-level executives or founders. I can not find any about mothers. The blogs are all there, but where are the statistics? Are we really such an anomaly that we haven’t even made it on to the radar?So, what about the mothers who own a business? The Co-Founders, the C-Level women- How do they play into all of this? How does a woman balance a family, a home, a marriage and a start-up? Well, she definitely can’t do it alone, and this blog will be a day by day expression of what it feels like and what it looks like to be a career AND family oriented woman.There are such little statistics documenting mothers who own their own businesses- and that needs to change. This is the story of two millennial mothers, entrepreneurs, and start-up queens, who are learning every day about the challenges of raising young children, being the executive homemakers, all while carrying the weight of a business on their shoulders. Welcome to Start-Up moms. We are here, and we probably haven’t eaten or showered today.

For those unfamiliar, Sonar Media Inc. was a And yet, we failed.We did lots of things right and lots of things wrong at Sonar. Below I do my best to share a few of our lessons learned.We launched Sonar with Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare support. Shortly thereafter, users buffeted us with requests for Linkedin integration. Ostensibly, they wanted to use the app to meet fellow professionals.Eager to please, we rushed to add Linkedin. The net effect? Nada. My guess is that the people asking were not actual users, but rather people that “wanted to be” users. We had mistaken noise for signal.“I would use your product if only you had X feature” is a dangerous signal to follow. Users do their best to anticipate what they want before they’ve seen it but, like entrepreneurs, they are often wrong.Enterprise companies should validate demand by asking customers to put their money where their mouths are. Media and social networking companies should double down on analytics to find, observe, and build for actual user behavior.One of the most requested features was a “map like foursquare” for our check-ins. Instead, we appended a simple “@Sonar” to content that users shared from our app. Although we had designs for a map, we never got around to building one. We were too busy building the future of ambient social networking!Mistake. People You are probably not the Steve Jobs of ______.Removing friction from existing user behaviors (e.g. checkins) almost always has a higher ROI than building castles in the sky (e.g. hypothesizing about your API). Find all the We received conflicting advice from lots of smart people about which is more important. We focused on engagement, which we improved by orders of magnitude. No one cared.Growth is the only thing that matters if you are building a social network. Period. Engagement is great but you aren’t even going to get the meeting unless your top-line numbers reach a certain threshold (which is different for seed vs. series A vs. selling advertising).I realized the error of my customer acquisition strategy as I awkwardly made my way through a small Meetup I had just pitched. It was 11pm on a Tuesday, I was exhausted and still had real work to do once I got home. Yet there I was, in a shitty bar trying not to skewer anyone with my Sonar sign as I dodged person after person asking me to install THEIR app.Events are for research, business development, and hiring; NOT for getting to 10,000,000 downloads.When MTV, Kraft, Digitas, and the like reached out to us we weren’t sure what they wanted. It took us at least 10 meetings to realize that, rather than delivering us millions of their customers on a silver platter, they were keeping tabs on us so that they could get access to OUR audience if we ever took off!Be polite, but postpone brand and agency “intros” until you’ve built your own audience. If you build it, they will come (and pay).Corollary: Investors know this. You sound stupid when you talk about your impending “big deal” with “XYZ brand” that’s going to drive massive customer acquisition and revenue.In the winter of 2011, we signed a partnership w/ Wired magazine to demonstrate our technology by providing visitors of their Times Square popup store with personalized in-store product recommendations.That “small side project” cost us 6 weeks of development and delivered no appreciable benefit other than getting to hang out with the cool people at Wired.You do not have 20% time. Identify your top three priorities. Throw away numbers two and three.In the run up to SXSW 2012 when the insider media had fabricated Highlight as heir to the throne and some of our more fair weather investors had written us off, my confidence was against the ropes. We reordered our roadmap to rush out comparable features but were now BEHIND. I put on my best brave face but inside my gut was rotting away. I still remember thinking on the flight to Austin “fck, we had it, and now we are going to lose it.”Oops! Highlight never went anywhere but we definitely wasted a ton of energy and sleep “responding to the threat” when we should have been figuring out how to make our own business work.Be steady at the wheel. The only way one startup can kill another startup is by getting into the other’s head and leading them off a cliff.If you don’t believe me, try this proof. Are your competitors releasing a bunch of the same features that you have on your roadmap? Yes? Do you know what consumers want*? No? Great, then neither do your competitors. Get back to figuring out what users want!*Hint: If you did, you would already have traction.When the ambient social networking space iced over in the spring of 2012, Sonar’s controlling investors decided it was time to “flip the asset.” They connected us with a daily deals company looking for “Big Data” solutions. We stopped working on the app and devoted all of our resources to repacking our backend technology to solve BigCo’s problems. Instead of paring down expenses to extend our dwindling runway, we piled on hires and ramped up our infrastructure.The daily deals space imploded but we spent nearly nine months, dozens of meetings, and several hundred thousand dollars “selling” Sonar into a company that nearly went bankrupt.Companies don’t get sold, they get bought. The best way to get bought is to build something of value. That’s hard to do when you are trying to sell.We built Sonar out of an incubator that I helped launch in 2010. To be absolutely clear, the incubator was instrumental to getting Sonar off the ground and helped us considerably along the way. Unfortunately, there are a number of structural issues facing incubators and the operators they employ. I address some of these below.The decoupling of responsibility from control created ambiguity and confusion, tension and frustration for all parties. From day to day decisions such as negotiating an employment contract to company defining ones such as when to sell the firm, alignment was a constant challenge. Occasionally, we were simply at odds.Perhaps the most detrimental aspect of the incubator model was not its potential for hinderance but its facility as a crutch. As someone responsible for building and running a company that I ultimately didn’t control, it was far too easy to point a finger.In my opinion, the most tragic example came when our incubator sat on a financing that would have rebooted the company. After nearly a month at loggerheads, our would-be investors gave us 48 hours to “take it or leave it.” In hopes of saving the company, I made an ultimatum: we move forward together or I would have to walk away. No one budged, time elapsed, and our term sheet evaporated. I resigned as promised, blaming them for killing my baby.As John Burroughs said, “A man can fail many times, but he isn’t a failure until he begins to blame somebody else.” Avoid bad relationships like the plague but when you inevitably find yourself in a difficult partnership, don’t waste precious energy wailing against it. Make it work or move on quickly.We lost our first would-be hire, a fantastic Google engineer. While we were debating his contract, he was taking a job elsewhere. Conversely, we hired another, much less proven, engineer on the spot. While he ultimately wasn’t a great cultural fit and we definitely waited too long to part ways, he was instrumental in getting V1 out the door.If you are an experienced entrepreneur with lots of options, by all means, hold out. For most first time entrepreneurs, holding out risks never getting off the ground.In the beginning, established people probably won’t work with you. Prove yourself by finding diamonds in the rough, like yourself. With their help, you can level up your organization and convince the big fish to join.We built an amazing team at Sonar. Everyone was extremely smart, passionate, dedicated, and hardworking. We celebrated milestones with tequila. We hung at the beach. Even when times were tough, everyone pushed as far as they possibly could, and then some. I have big love for all of my former colleagues and am confident they feel similarly.That said, our culture was more of an emergent property than a deliberate choice. Sure, we had brainstorming sessions and posted goals prominently but most of our culture we absorbed from the people with whom we surrounded ourselves.Think of culture as a cofounder that is present when you are not. You are decisive, communicative, and respectful but it’s your culture that helps everyone know how to act when you are out of the room. Give that voice clarity and authority.The trick is to avoid hollow words. Since a startup’s culture ultimately mirrors that of its founder, maybe the best thing that you can do is work hard to get clear on who you are. Write that down and share it with your team. If you’ve been honest, every action you take will reinforce your values.“What we fight with is so small, and when we win, it makes us small. What we want is to be defeated, decisively, by successively greater things.” — Startups don’t die when they run out of money, they die when their founders let go. I ultimately stepped away from Sonar when I came to the conclusion that, despite all that we had invested, everyone stood a better chance starting anew. It’s difficult to accept, but sometimes you have to concede a battle to win the war.I am indebted to the hundreds of people that invested their sweat, money, love, and/or time into Sonar, be it three years of labor or a casual phone call. Special thanks to my amazing team, faithful advisors  investors, and supportive family  friends. Finally, huge shout out to the millions of users that gave Sonar a shot. Your stories about meeting your boyfriend on Sonar made it all worthwhile.We started Sonar with a belief that everyone has the potential to be amazing and that technology can unlock that potential. My experience at Sonar has only strengthened my conviction. I can’t wait to bring everything I’ve learned to bear on what’s next.Let’s do this.Entrepreneur. fmrly 

Over 90% of tech startups fail, but I never thought my baby, 99dresses, would be one of them.If there is one thing that doing a startup has taught me, it’s that I am much more resilient than I could have ever imagined. Looking back, when I started 99dresses fresh out of high school I was very naive and had zero idea what I was doing. In fact, I didn’t even know what a startup was! I just knew I wanted to solve a problem I personally experienced: having a closet full of clothes but still nothing to wear.Since then I’ve survived being stabbed in the back by cofounders, investment rounds falling through, massive technology fuckups that brought sales to a halt, visa problems, lack of money, lack of traction, lack of a team, hiring the wrong people, firing people I didn’t want to fire, lack of product-market fit, and everything else in between.And yet I failed. I won many battles but I lost the war.I take complete responsibility for this failure. Were other people involved in 99dresses? Of course. Was any of this their fault? Absolutely not.The startup press glorify hardship. They glorify the Airbnbs who sold breakfast cereal to survive, and then turned their idea into a multi-billion dollar business. You rarely hear the raw stories of startups that persevered but ultimately failed — the emotional roller coaster of the founders, and why their startups didn’t work out.As things were looking bleak at 99dresses I started seeking out these stories, desperately hoping for someone — anyone — to relate to. Failing is lonely and isolating. Every time I’d scroll through my Facebook feed all my startup friends were launching new products on Techcrunch, announcing their new fundraising rounds or acquisition, and posting photos of their happy teams. Ask any founder how they’re doing and you’ll hear something positive. Whether that’s the truth or not, that’s what we’re trained to say.I found postmortems of startups outlining what didn’t work and why the company went under, but I was hard pressed to find anything that talked about the emotional side of failure — how it actually I don’t know why this is the case, but here is my contribution to the cause: my story. This is what failure feels like. I hope it helps.Many startup folk say that failure should be celebrated. “Fail fast, fail early, fail often!” they all chant, trying to put a positive spin on the most excruciating pain any founder could experience.Let me tell you — failure fucking sucks. If I would have failed fast, early and often then I would have given up 99dresses years ago when, in 2011, I travelled to my parent’s place in the countryside of Australia, locked myself away in my room and cried for what seemed like an entire week. I had launched 99dresses in Australia 9 months earlier and received some great traction, but I was losing momentum due to technology problems that I didn’t understand and battling a whole host of other issues.I felt like I was drowning in a black ocean, and I couldn’t see any light at the surface. I didn’t know which way to swim.At the same time the Australian press would continue to approach me for interviews. The fact that I was a teenage girl working on a startup in a male dominated industry seemed to garner a lot of attention, and I’d take the interviews that came my way because that was my job. It was my job to be positive and paint a happy picture for the media, who seemed to talk about me as if I was some kind of entrepreneurial wunderkind because of my age and the fact that I had breasts.This didn’t help my impostor syndrome — the constant feeling that everybody was always giving me way too much credit. I remember one reporter saying “you must be so proud of what you have achieved” and I was completely stumped by that statement because I’d never actually thought about it. Was I proud? What had I actually achieved? We had some traction, sure, but we also had many problems that needed solving. I was just waiting for the day when everyone would figure out that I’m not that extraordinary.“But you’re taking a massive risk! That’s so brave!” they’d say. I never thought so. The biggest risk in my eyes was going to university, getting a stable job, and sliding into a comfortable life. There’s nothing wrong with that, but I knew it wasn’t me.Plus, the worst that could happen if I failed was that I’d end up living with my parents. I think the really brave founders are the ones who will be out on the street if they fuck it up, and still do it anyway. It’s easy to take risks if you have nothing to lose.My mother said “Nikki, are you sure that you really want to do this? It is so much pressure for a 19 year old to take on. No one will think less of you if you decide this isn’t what you want”. My parents are my number one supporters but my mum hated seeing me in so much pain, even if it was character building.But despite the horrible sinking feeling in my stomach, and the fact that I had no money left, and the fact that I had no stable team, and massive product problems, and was feeling burnt out, and had no idea how to overcome any of the aforementioned obstacles, and felt completely alone in it all, I persevered.I didn’t fail then. I I became numb to the pain, and despite waking up for weeks on end with no glimmer of hope and no desire to get out of bed, I still made myself sit at my desk and work.Eventually, things took a turn for the better.I applied for a university team business planning competition with a $10k prize, paid a friend $500 of the prize money to be on my ‘team’ so I could qualify to enter, wrote a winning business plan and took out first place. That was enough money to buy me a plane ticket and some accommodation to the US.I met my friend and advisor, Matt, who took me under his wing and helped me more than I could ever have hoped. My developer was admitted to hospital with a very serious illness and dropped out of the company, but I replaced him with 2 co-founders. I got into Y Combinator and headed to Silicon Valley — startup Mecca for a starry eyed young founder like I was — for 5 months. We rebuilt the 99dresses product and launched it in the US. We were getting traction. I signed a $1.2 million seed round with a group of investors on a valuation cap that I honestly thought was ridiculously high.99dresses was back, baby!And then, all of a sudden, we weren’t.I had to fly back to Australia to get a working visa as soon as the funding paperwork was signed, and the next day my two “co-founders” decided to tell me they were leaving the company without even a hint of warning.The $1.2 million hadn’t hit our account yet, but even if it had I would have felt uncomfortable accepting it with no team in place to execute my vision. I would have looked like a fraud and an idiot anyway — what kind of founder announces to her investors that she suddenly has no team the day after she takes their money? And furthermore, how could I not have seen this coming? I was completely blindsided.I went over to Matt’s office, and he proceeded to pour vodka down my throat whilst telling me I was much better off without them. Like most of Matt’s lessons it was hard to see that then, but he was right.The next day I rang up our lead investor who decided to pull out of the round. Then another investor fell off. Everything I worked so hard for was crumbling to pieces. If only I’d closed everyone individually, instead of agreeing to round up at least $1mil to get the lead on board. But then I realized that these “co-founders” would have left anyway, leaving me in this same position.I was stuck back in Australia still with a big vision, but as a single, non-tech founder with no team, no product (I needed these co-founders to keep the product running), no US visa and just some money that I’d gotten from being a YC company.I remember my sister taking me for a walk after it all happened. She sat me down in a park overlooking Sydney harbor at night time and made me listen to ‘Shake it out’ by Florence and the Machine. She told me I’d bounce back, that I’d overcome this like I always did. I wasn’t sure I believed her, but I knew I’d survived worse. This ended up becoming my motivational song that I would listen to when times were tough, because it reminded me that I could surmount huge obstacles if I wanted to.I didn’t fail then. I just started again.There were 5 investors who invested in me, despite all of this. They believed in me when I was having trouble believing in myself, but I couldn’t show them that — that’s the cardinal sin of any entrepreneur. Always be confident. Always be smiling. Always stay positive. Sell, sell, sell!I remember one investor sending me an email saying “Shit happens. Take the money and go sort it out.” Another told me to go make him some crack for women.My cap got sliced in half, but at least I wasn’t broke again.So I closed $595k and started looking for a new co-founder. Problem was, I didn’t trust anyone. Not after what my previous co-founders had just put me through.But then I met Marcin, who quit his corporate IT job and joined me in an office we referred to as ‘The Cave’ because it was cheap and nasty and had no natural light. I remember he came in on his first day, and midway through a conversation my chair completely collapsed. The next day he brought in his own chair. I was very jealous.We rebuilt 99dresses again and launched it in the US which was proving to be ridiculously hard when we weren’t physically in the US and having to handle some stock and seed a community from another continent. We were having trouble getting traction. The market had moved on, competitors had flooded the space and the product we had built just didn’t provide enough value in comparison.Add to that the fact that we were building a 2 sided marketplace, and you might get a sense for how tough things were. The US market is huge, hyper-competitive and way harder to crack than the Australian one. We were frustrated by our lack of progress, and the product I’d promised our investors just wasn’t working.I didn’t fail then. We pivoted.I caught a plane to the US and talked to as many women in our target market as I could. We interviewed more customers. We discovered a very clear set of problems that explained why our product just wasn’t working in the US market.I rang up the team in Australia, and told them, quite bluntly, that we needed to chuck everything out and approach the problem from a different perspective. I presented a new idea for a product that seemed to resonate with the girls I was talking to. The team did not take it well, and I definitely communicated the change very poorly. I almost got on an early flight home because I felt a mutiny brewing — we were throwing out many months of hard work. This wasn’t my finest moment as a leader.Despite this, the team rallied together. We threw out our website and concentrated entirely on mobile. We had a mobile website prototype in front of users within a week and iterated based on that before building out the native version.We hustled to get anyone we could to try out our beta app. We must have emailed thousands of bloggers, and some ended up giving it a go. Items were being traded, and girls were paying us money. This new thing was working! We couldn’t wait to launch it in the US, but we needed to physically move there first in order to do things properly.Problem was, we didn’t have any visas. You see, it’s very easy to get into the US as an Australian if you have a degree in a specialized field, which I did not. Marcin had to wait it out to first become an Australian citizen with his wife, then get his E3 visa. However, right before joining 99dresses his wife had fallen pregnant with their first child, which they needed to give birth to in Australia 9 months later. Marcin was then tasked with moving his wife and baby halfway across the world to chase our startup dreams. Needless to say, he’s a very brave man.I, on the other hand, was faced with my next big challenge: proving that I was ‘an alien of extraordinary ability’ that was worthy of living and working in the US without a degree (after all, I gave up my scholarship and dropped out of university when I got into Y Combinator). After about 7 months of working on my petition, I was ecstatic and incredibly grateful when I got approved for an O1 visa.I practically skipped over to the US consulate in Sydney for my appointment, where I was to pick up the visa. Instead, I was interviewed by a lady who took an obvious immediate disliking to me. She told me she was putting me through extra processing, so I wouldn’t be getting my visa that day. She told me it was random. She told me it would take 2 weeks.I later found out this processing was not random — it was reserved for potential terrorists, and could take up to several years.As an entrepreneur I HATE feeling helpless. I’m used to taking action on something and producing some kind of result. I like being in control. In this instance I felt completely helpless, and my startup was at the mercy of a government worker on a power trip.We were already running behind on launching this app in the US, and the consulate had my passport. I couldn’t get out of Australia. The consulate made me jump through hoop after hoop, and a few months later I still didn’t have my visa. It got to the point where I had to call the consulate hotline every single day and split test different types of crying (machine-gun bursts of sobs vs. long sad silences vs. loud ugly cries) on the operators (males were much more receptive to helping out), and occasionally I’d get lucky and have one of them put in a report for me. I hated doing it, but it was the only way to push things forward.I finally got my visa, and took the next flight I could get out of Australia with four suitcases — 2 full of clothes, 1 full of shoes and another with all my electronics and miscellaneous items. The contents of these suitcases just about summed up my life.I’d achieved my dream of moving to NYC, and I was living in a shoebox. It was all I could afford on my startup salary.Soon after, my 25 year old sister and 19 year old brother both bought gorgeous apartments in Sydney. Whilst I was absolutely thrilled for them, I also couldn’t help feeling a little jealous as I sat in my tiny convertible bedroom with no windows. If this all didn’t work out I’d be financially left with nothing, whilst my siblings were off investing in their financial future. That didn’t really scare me — I’ve realized that money isn’t a huge motivator for me — but it did flare my competitive side. We probably all compare ourselves to others way more than we should…After hiring a few people and finding an office in NYC we were ready to launch. We solved the chicken-and-egg problem using techniques that we promised never to speak of again because they squarely sat on the grey/black spectrum of naughtiness. If there was a line, we definitely crossed it. We had to. These hacks were harmless to others, so I figured it was only a problem if we got caught.Our plan worked better and faster than I’d budgeted. Within 3 months we were doing over 1,000 trades a week, and bringing in revenue on every trade. We continued to grow.Our app store reviews were overwhelmingly positive. Obsession did not begin to describe how some girls treated 99dresses. Within a few short months several power users had spent over $1000 each and traded hundreds of individual items. We steadily grew our stock turnover rate from 17% to 50% — that was 2-3x better than our competitors. Everyday I’d be wearing a new outfit that I’d received off the app. Our retention rates were really exciting. If my investors had wanted crack for women, then that is what we had created.Based on the way we were growing, we thought we could get cash-flow positive before our funding ran out.But then growth started to slow down. The average value of items listed steadily declined and our fees were based on this value, so although we were growing transaction volume our revenue wasn’t budging. We started to see some holes in the business model. Whilst our retention was great, we worried about our activation rate.In an attempt to save ourselves we made one more pivot; this would turn out to be our last one. The pivot made complete logical sense based on all of our research, but introducing it to our community was a nightmare. There was mutiny within the app. While our top line metrics shot up in a massive way, our one metric that mattered — transactions — plummeted.Meanwhile, I had approached our existing investors about getting a bridge. I knew we had something really special with amazing potential, if we just had enough runway to give it an extra push. I also knew we weren’t perfectly poised to raise a bridge round, unless our existing investors were going to pony up the cash. We’d been in the market a while, and although we had to overcome a number of setbacks to get out here, that didn’t seem to matter too much to external investors. Bridge rounds just aren’t that sexy.We only had one institutional investor in our previous funding round, and I was so relieved when they told me they wanted to lead this bridge. Boom! It looked like we were going to live to see another day.I sent through the due diligence documents and worked with them to answer all their questions.They were taking longer than anticipated to get back to me so we could get the deal done and move on. Then one Wednesday I got a call from them, and the line was kind of crackly. However, it sounded like they not only wanted to lead, but they actually wanted to fill up the entire round! Relief flooded through my body. I was so nervous.Then I heard a ‘but…’And the rest of the conversation explained why they would not be doing that. My stomach dropped. I knew they were our best shot of getting the money, and some of the angels who had previously invested were interested in coming in but only if I could get a VC to lead it, probably for some oversight. We now had very little cash left, and very little time to find someone else.Turns out, under closer scrutiny some of the other partners in the firm didn’t like how competitive the market was. 99dresses was squarely focused on trading cheaper fast fashion (fast fashion is really hard to re-sell for cash), but all the competition were mainly focussed on buying  selling designer fashion. Despite our differentiation, the space is crowded and the competitors are well funded to the tune of tens of millions of dollars each.I felt my voice crack whilst I was talking back on the phone. I was trying so hard to hold it together and be professional, but I could barely speak without it being obvious I was crying. Damn emotions! I was embarrassed.It was night time and I walked over to Marcin’s home in tears, fully expecting him to take the safe and responsible route of deciding to get another job. He had a family to support, and I felt an extraordinary amount of guilt for putting him in that position.Instead, Marcin surprised me. He wasn’t willing to give up that easily. None of the team were. I was taking on this massive burden and internalizing everything, when in actual fact my team was prepared to fight to the end alongside me. We made a plan for cutting our costs to extend our runway whilst we tried to get some more cash in the door.The next day I gave notice on our office, and let someone go. We were already a very lean operation, but now the work of 2 was being done by 1 person on operations, and we shifted our focus to only the most essential tasks to buy us more time.I didn’t tell many people about what was happening. You’re not supposed to talk about this shit. If someone asks how your startup is doing, you fire off some kind of positive phrase like a reflex. My friend gave me a hug and told me to go read ‘The Hard Thing About Hard Things’ by Ben Horowitz. I bought the book and sat in a coffee shop that Saturday afternoon reading it through. I identified so much with the struggle — I’d been through it many times before whilst aboard this emotional rollercoaster.I realized something: I was fucking tired — physically and emotionally. I wasn’t sleeping properly. I hadn’t been on a proper holiday since our ‘schoolies’ beach celebration straight after I finished high school in 2009. The holidays I had tried to go on just ended up being long strategy sessions in my head to figure out my next move whilst lying beside a pool. All I could think about was this damn startup and it was completely consuming me.I had no bandwidth for anything else. When someone asked what hobbies I had outside of work, I’d laugh. I’d recently started having mini panic attacks whilst I was doing ordinary things, like taking a shower or doing my hair. I felt like a shitty friend. I couldn’t even contemplate having a relationship (I tried that before, but yet again this startup won out over him). I wasn’t sure how much longer I could do this.My mother told me to trust my gut. If my gut told me that I didn’t have faith in the business, then there is no shame in winding down the company and moving onto something more productive instead of raising more money. I’d learned an awful lot in the past few years.I told my mum I didn’t trust my gut when it came to this. My gut was telling me to quit. Problem was, my gut had told me that before in my darkest hours and I still pulled through. If I had trusted my gut then I would have quit years ago.I knew the only way this was going to die was if we were killed. I am not a quitter. I owed it to myself, my team, my investors and the 99dresses community to see this through.I continued approaching investors without luck. I’d be invited to cocktail parties full of VCs where I’d don my painful sky-high heels because I’d split tested heels vs. flats, and for some reason a 511 woman in 7 inch heels commands more talking time and attention from investors than one in the comfy flat booties I wear to work. Apparently height gives you presence. Once or twice I’d have an investor asking if I knew what an angel was, or if I also modelled because of my height, or some other unintentionally patronizing comment that I doubt any guy would be subjected to. I learned to take it all in my high-heeled stride.I kept hearing the same thing from these investors. “That’s a very interesting business, but we’ll either put in the first money or a series A. We don’t do in between. I’d love to keep in touch though, and see you progress to a series A where we might be able to help. Oh, and why aren’t you getting this bridge from your current investors?”I remember one day Marcin joked that I was a control freak, and I was really surprised. I’d never perceived myself that way — I just liked things done a certain way and to a certain standard that matched the vision in my head. When it came to non-99dresses related stuff, I thought I was pretty chill.Over the past few weeks leading up to this event I did start to get a sense for what he was talking about, though. I wasn’t a control freak in that I was obsessed with controlling outcomes — I was a control freak who just needed to be in control of the inputs.This became more obvious as everything started looking more and more hopeless at work. I started eating much healthier, strictly cutting out wheat, sugar and anything processed. To take a mental break I would read about bio-hacking, which is incidentally all about understanding and controlling how inputs effect your body. I told myself this would give me more energy to hustle, but really I think I just had to feel like I had control over something — anything — when my startup’s fate felt so out of my control.With a few weeks of cash left, Marcin and I agreed to use our remaining time to shut down the app gracefully for the sake of ourselves and the community. I came into the office that day prepared to have a hard conversation with him, but we both looked at each other and knew it was over. There were some tears, and I was grateful to have a curtain of long dark hair to hide my bloodshot eyes behind as I walked through our co-working space. I felt physically sick all day, and my stomach wouldn’t let me keep any food down. I lost my appetite for the rest of the week.My first instinct was to apologize — to Marcin, to my team, to my investors, to the loyal community we’d built. I felt shame, guilt, embarrassment — like a shepherd who’d led her sheep off a cliff when it was my responsibility to keep them safe. I logically knew that I shouldn’t feel these things, but emotions aren’t always logical.In fact, I didn’t really know My friends invited me out to drink away my sorrows and get my mind off things, but I just didn’t feel like it. I was scared I’d meet someone new and they’d ask me what I do, and I wouldn’t know how to answer. I was also embarrassed because I couldn’t afford to pay for anything superfluous anymore — I still don’t know how I’m going to pay rent at the end of the month. As a woman going out in NYC my nights were normally cheap because cute guys would buy me drinks, but I am not the kind of woman who expects that. I’m independent. If I couldn’t pay for myself then I wasn’t going out at all.I wasn’t depressed so much as disappointed. I tried so fucking hard, and I still couldn’t make it work. There are many things I would have done differently were I to do this all again, but Marcin and I agreed not to get sucked into the ‘shoulda woulda coulda’ trap. “No regrets”, he said. We both learned some hard lessons from our mistakes, but it also made me realize how much luck and timing are often huge factors in success and failure.The next day a report came out by a startup with a very similar model to us, but in a different vertical. We’d traded 3x more items than them in our first 8 months of the US app being live, had 2.5x more members and had a business model in place — all with a team half their size. They’d gone on to raise a sizable series A; we’d failed. Our investors said we did a lot with the money we had.It’s easier to accept defeat if you try and try and try but don’t get anywhere. You call it a failed experiment. The failure is easy to justify.It’s incredibly frustrating to try and try and try, and when you finally start to get some good traction you fall off a cliff. Our business still had problems, sure, but so does every other startup.So this is where the story comes to a close. My friends all ask me if I’m fine, and I honestly think that I am. It’s been a wild ride, but it’s time to move on.A cruel consequence of my failure is losing the US visa I worked so hard to obtain. Once I stop being the CEO of 99dresses I technically have 10 days to sell all my possessions, pack my bags, say goodbye to my amazing team, my friends and the life I’ve been building here, and leave.That being said, I’m excited to start a new chapter. As much as I love startups, it’s somewhat liberating to have no responsibilities to anyone but myself — no team, no investors, no customers to look after. Maybe now I can be a normal 22 year old for a while: indulge my wanderlust, make some bad decisions, try something new.I’ll be taking some time out to recharge whilst living with my parents in a country town of 2,000 people where the internet is slow and there is no Seamless. I hope I survive. Honestly, I’ll probably get bored within a week and start working on a new idea. I already have a few.When I started 99dresses I was going to go big or go home. It’s been a great adventure, but now I’m going home.So that’s it. That’s my story of what failure feels like. I hope reading it was as helpful to you as writing it was cathartic to me.Most startups fail, and yet this industry doesn’t talk about failure nearly enough. I’d encourage anyone who has failed to write about how it felt, as I can’t tell you how much that would have helped me in those final months  weeks. I just wanted someone to relate to. Instead, I was left feeling isolated and ashamed.In fact, I thought it might be therapeutic to curate a collection of stories from founders who have failed and put them together in a book. It might be a little project for me whilst I take some time off, and I’m sure it would be helpful to someone in my current position.If you want to get involved or contribute your story then shoot me an email. My email address is nikki @ 99dresses dot com (yep, I’m going to need a new email too — still haven’t sorted that out yet).I thought I’d end this post by publicly thanking everyone who has been a part of the 99dresses journey.To my co-founder, Marcin — there is no one I would have rather had by my side through this experience. The sacrifices you made to make this all happen are nothing short of inspiring. If Zoe was old enough to say anything other than “this!”, I’m sure she’d tell you how proud she is of her dad. I’m going to miss your terrible jokes.To the team, past and present — thank you so much for all of your hard work, perseverance and loyalty. Chandra and Oguz, you guys are amazing. I loved coming in to work every day because you always made it fun. I’m going to miss you all immensely. When I do another startup I’ll be coming after you guys again :pTo the wives, Natalie  Semiha — I’m sure it’s not easy having your husband involved in a startup. You were both so supportive of the long hours, sacrifices and emotional ups and downs, so thank you.To my family — you guys have always been my #1 supporters. A special thanks to my mum for putting up with me, even when I was a stressed out and horrible daughter. You’re the strongest woman I know, and I hope one day to be as bad-ass as you.To my friends — I couldn’t have done this without your support. You celebrated my highs and comforted me in my lows, and for that I’ll always be grateful.To Matt — You’re the reason I got this far in the first place. If it weren’t for you I probably would have failed in 2011.To my investors — thank you for believing in my vision and trusting me to fulfill it, even through the rough patches. I really do appreciate it.To our community — without you, we’d be nothing. Thank you for loving 99dresses, and spreading the word. Many of you I now consider friends, and I’m so grateful for your support and loyalty.Ok, that’s it. It’s over. Now it’s time for a nice long sleep.Founder  CEO of 99dresses. Aussie transplant in NYC.

And why I left Silicon ValleyOne year ago, I left San Francisco, sold and gave away everything I owned, and moved into a 40 liter backpack.I traveled to 45 cities in 20 countries, 3 Disneylands, and I also worked 50 hours a week building and launching a And my total costs were less than just the rent in San Francisco.There’s a growing community of “digital nomads” who live a location independent lifestyle. We’re software developers, designers, writers, journalists, engineers, and all sorts of people who share a passion for the work we do and experiencing the world.Three years ago I was preparing to leave my job at Microsoft to move to San Francisco to start a startup. My friend asked me “but why do you need to be in San Francisco when you can work on a computer from anywhere?” His question made a lot of sense. As I thought about it more, I began to question my assumptions about a “normal life” which don’t make sense in our modern world.So off I went, with my crazy new ideas about life in tow.But it didn’t work out so well.After traveling for 6 months, I gave up and still moved to San Francisco. Traveling was fun, but I had a great idea and I needed to really focus and get real work done. What better place to build my startup than Silicon Valley?But I soon found myself becoming too comfortable and slowing down, getting easily bored and distracted, and watching a lot of TV. I sat at my computer for 12 hours a day but didn’t feel like I was productive.On a trip to New York, my friends went to work during the days, so I went out and worked in coffee shops and in Central Park. Suddenly I was hugely productive, getting much more work done in 6 hours than in my normal 12 hour days. The same thing happened a few months later on a trip to London. I was even coming up with better ideas because the new experiences and surroundings were keeping my mind more active.Having figured out the pattern, I left San Francisco a year ago, fully committing to a nomadic lifestyle. And this time it feels like I’ve figured it out. I’m happy, productive, meeting great new people, learning about real global problems to solve, and I successfully launched This is what I’ve learned over the past year.This is my average total monthly spending from one year living in Seattle’s Capitol Hill, one year living in San Francisco’s Upper Haight, one year traveling to 20 countries, and one month at a hotel in Bali. It is much cheaper for me to travel. Since the majority of my costs are from trains and flights, it’s significantly cheaper if I stay in one place.My friends in San Francisco and Seattle often ask me: “How can you afford to travel so much?” I can’t afford not to travel. I’m bootstrapping a company and living in San Francisco was draining my savings.When I first started traveling, I was a great tourist, taking pictures of everything and doing all the activities listed in tour guides. After a couple of exhausting weeks it occurred to me that I’m not on vacation. This is my life now. I slowed down and realized that if I have a month to explore a new city, I don’t need to do it all at once. I can explore the city for a few hours and still get a lot of work done.I was surprised to find out that I’m significantly more productive while traveling. But it makes sense. If I’m only in Rome for a week, why would I waste my time on Facebook? Being constantly surrounded by novelty reduces my boredom and increases my focus, and even I went back to Seattle in June to work next to my co-founder and hash out long-term plans. My development time was surprisingly less productive than while traveling. I was sitting at the computer just as much, but was more easily distracted by internet and TV. And even though I was in 6 different cities in September, I managed to work extremely productive 48 hour weeks. Being more focused while working gives me more time to enjoy the rest of my life, so this is huge for me.Instead of working during the daylight hours and pushing all my free time to the worst part of the day, I prefer to enjoy the days and work at night. I get out of bed faster when I’m excited to go out, and when I don’t have to commute there’s just more time in the day. I like to work 7 days a week with flexible hours so I can take a day off when I please or enjoy an empty movie theater at 2pm.I wasted a lot of time when I worked in an office because of commuting and the massive distraction that is the internet. Now I spread my work throughout the day and take big breaks for exploring. After working for a few hours, I reach a milestone and explore the city until I want to get back to work. Or if I hit a problem I can’t figure out, I My stay at I now have friends all over the world whose life experiences are very different than mine and bring fresh perspectives to my ideas. I’m learning about the real problems that affect the world on a global scale, which will make me into a better entrepreneur in the future.It’s easy to find great people to learn from. There are co-working spaces in It’s never been easier to live and work as a nomad. Traveling is cheaper, more productive, and more inspiring than staying at home. Working in an office is a relic of the past.The digital nomad revolution is just beginning and I’m excited to help it grow. I hope you and I will meet some time, somewhere out there.Co-founder of Moo.do. Digital nomad.Stories on life, work and travel as a digital nomad by 

Finalmente, o SMS havia chegado:Um SMS tocando no meu BlackBerry nas noites de domingo costumava decidir qual seria meu destino e cliente para a próxima semana.Eu trabalhava para uma das três principais empresas de consultoria estratégica do mundo.Uma vida toda dentro de uma mala. Uma vida de consultor, onde se deixa escapar tudo e todos na vida, menos planilhas de Excel. Uma luxuosa vida de negócios que somos ensinados a desempenhar como escravos ideais, em escolas de administração do mais alto nível, cujos diplomas exibimos com orgulho.Depois de algumas horas de sono, o motorista particular me levou ao Aeroporto Fiumicino em Roma para que eu pudesse pegar meu luxuoso voo em Classe Executiva para Nova York. Ao chegar, fiz check-in em um luxuoso hotel cinco-estrelas e, mais tarde, fui ao escritório do meu cliente.O salário? Também era luxuoso. A empresa se orgulhava de estar entre os principais No entanto, havia algo errado na vida de consultor. Não aguentava mais essa porcaria, e um dia liguei para meus pais:Minha mãe quase infartou. Não era a primeira coisa que uma mãe perfeccionista queria ouvir, depois de ter me incentivado a me formar em uma das principais escolas de administração do mundo, com notas altas.Tentei aliviar o desespero dela. Não teve jeito.Meus pais haviam se aposentado depois de anos trabalhando das 9h às 17h em seus empregos públicos estáveis e monótonos.Eu sabia que seria díficil explicar minha situação a eles, vindo de uma família sem um histórico de empreendedorismo, mas não esperava que ligassem já na manhã seguinte.Era minha mãe no telefone:Não importa o que eu dissesse, não conseguia explicá-la que leva mais do que um dia para um novo negócio crescer.Como eu tinha a namorada mais compreensiva do mundo, era chegada a hora de contar as novidades para meus amigos, que estavam ocupados em subir os degraus do glamouroso mundo corporativo.Falei a todos que havia acabado de sair do meu emprego para ir atrás do meu sonho de abrir uma startup. Alguns dos meus amigos pararam gradualmente de se encontrar comigo, provavelmente porque acharam que havia algo errado em mim, já que era o segundo emprego “ideal” que eu largava em um curto espaço de tempo.Embora o resto dos meus amigos tivesse me apoiado, ainda havia, no entanto, algo errado no meu relacionamento com eles.Sempre que me encontrava com esses amigos, não tinha muitas novidades quando era interpelado com suas frequentes perguntas, tais como, “E então, como está sua startup?” Você vai ser o próximo Zuckerberg, não é?” “Cara, a gente está muito orgulhoso de você. Com certeza você vai ganhar uma grande rodada de investimentos em breve.”Começar uma startup era um longo caminho, e eu estava me colocando sob muita pressão ao dar uma p*ta importância para o que as outras pessoas pensavam.Fui ficando mais solitário e mais depressivo dia após dia, quanto mais ocasiões sociais evitava. O progresso da minha startup não era tão rápido quanto o meu círculo social imaginava e eu já estava cansado de dizer aos outros que levou anos para que startups como Facebook e Twitter chegassem onde estão agora.Eu só me sentia confortável perto dos meus poucos amigos empreendedores. Era verdade. Somente um empreendedor entende outro empreendedor.Como se não bastasse a pressão social e a solidão, estava me encontrando com a mãe de todas as preocupações: ficar sem dinheiro bem antes do que havia imaginado.Isso estava acabando com minha produtividade e minha capacidade de tomar decisões adequadas. Eu estava em pânico, me precipitando para atingir o sucesso e ganhar dinheiro.Um dia, cheguei a ter que pedir trocados para minha namorada, porque não tinha dinheiro para comprar uma garrafa de água mineral. Eu não sabia que aquele era apenas o começo de uma difícil vida de altos e baixos…Chega de drama: mais de dois anos se passaram desde aqueles dias. Agora, estou escrevendo este post de um lindo resort em Phuket, na Tailândia, enquanto aproveito um mojito.Mas esperem, não estou vendendo um sonho. Não me tornei um milionário fundador de uma startup.No entanto, meu negócio tem um fluxo constante de capital que me permite viajar ao mundo e trabalhar em qualquer lugar com WiFi.Ainda há, contudo, cinco coisas que gostaria de ter me perguntado antes de começar essa árdua jornada. Cinco questões que todo futuro empreendedor deveria se perguntar antes de dar o primeiro passo no empreendedorismo:Se você tem amigos e familiares que não são empreendedores, eles não entenderão o que você está tentando conquistar, e a pressão do público será ainda maior.Dei tanta importância para o que os outros achavam de mim, ao ponto de isso arruinar minha vida.Eu me cobrava em excesso e me castigava com uma carga ainda maior de trabalho para que pudesse anunciar o meu sucesso o mais rápido possível. Ou melhor, isso até o dia em que percebi que estavam todos c*gando para mim. Por que, então, eu deveria agir diferente?Você não vale mais do que dois segundos de atenção que as outras pessoas dão a um status de Facebook. Em 2014, ninguém mais tem tempo para se preocupar com os outros, em um mundo com tanta gente e ruído.Se você se incomoda tanto assim com o que os outros pensam, vai desperdiçar tempo tentando provar que é bem-sucedido, em vez de se concentrar na sua startup.Vá viver a vida. Comecei a fazer isso muito tarde.Conforme ficamos mais velhos, compartilhamos mais das nossas vidas com quem dividimos um relacionamento, e menos com amigos e família. Embora eu tenha tido sorte ao encontrar uma garota incrível, foi muito triste ver vários dos meus amigos empreendedores terminarem com suas namoradas ao longo do caminho.Ter um próprio negócio é difícil — bem mais difícil do que eu podia imaginar. A sua mente está constantemente ocupada com milhões de coisas e nenhuma pessoa, nem mesmo sua namorada, faz a menor ideia do que se passa na sua cabeça.Se você não é solteiro(a), certifique-se de que a pessoa que está com você saberá que às vezes é normal não esperar nem mesmo um simples beijo.Sim, um simples beijo na boca.Ótimo, então agora multiplique essa quantia por pelo menos três, porque você esgotará suas economias bem mais rápido do que imagina. Haverá uma série de gastos adicionais ao longo do caminho, tais como honorários contábeis, custos com advogados, computadores e iPhones pifados, etc.Prepare-se para morar em um apartamento menor, comer porções menores de comida e até contar os centavos, coisas com as quais você nunca se preocupou antes na sua vida.Os últimos meses antes do dinheiro acabar por completo serão excepcionalmente difíceis, e a pressão irá crescer de uma forma tão exponencial que você nem conseguirá dormir direito.O sucesso virá lentamente, enquanto o dinheiro irá rapidamente. Seja esperto — comece a planejar já no primeiro dia.Ao fugir da vida de consultor no mundo corporativo, pensei que eu finalmente iria viver o sonho de trabalhar quando quisesse, até que li a seguinte frase de Lori Greiner:Tudo começou com pequenos momentos de despertar no meio da noite. No início, aconteciam porque eu estava bastante animado com minhas ideias, que eram muitas. Eu simplesmente não via a hora da manhã chegar para voltar a trabalhar.Então, houve a fase do exagero. Eu trabalhava demais, porque nunca me dava por satisfeito ao trabalhar pela minha ideia, e queria sempre fazer mais. No entanto, quanto mais eu trabalhava e mais tarde eu ia para a cama, mais difícil era conseguir dormir, e a qualidade do meu sono era cada vez pior.Consequentemente, havia dois ou três dias por semana nos quais a minha produtividade era quase nula.Não se deixe enganar pela foto bacana do meu Instagram aí em cima. E não se deixe enganar pelas notícias exageradas sobre fundadores de startups que viraram milionários.As histórias dos bastidores trazem muitos dias de sofrimento, noites em claro, rejeições e fracassos constantesA jornada para o sucesso é longa. Muito longa. E, na maioria das vezes, longa demais.Cada um de nós tem uma lista de prioridades diferente na vida. Para a maioria, o dinheiro é prioridade número um da lista, enquanto para outros, o equilíbrio entre a vida e trabalho ocupa uma posição mais alta. Consequentemente, as pessoas definem o sucesso de forma diferente.Dependendo da sua definição, a dificuldade da sua jornada empreendedora também será diferente. Se dinheiro e sucesso frente ao público é o que mais importa para você, sua jornada será bastante difícil.Lembre-se das sábias palavras de Hemingway:Os empreendedores de sucesso não são necessariamente aqueles que arrecadam milhões em rodadas de investimentos. Não se esqueça: eles são um em um milhão.No entanto, há milhares de sonhadores que conseguem financiar suas startups com um mínimo de recursos, ou que vivem muito bem às suas próprias custas, embora não estejam nas manchetes.Não importa o quanto a sua jornada irá ferrar com sua vida: aproveite a viagem e continue seguindo sua paixão.

“Man, Kevin Systrom really fucked up Maybe a billion really is the new million. After all, the world is changing at an accelerating pace. The internet and mobile computing have taken hold, and it seems like a new era of exponential growth has arrived. Every day, entrepreneurs are unseating taxi czars and hotel magnates using little more than smart phones and a healthy disregard for the rules. In this crazy new world, it seems like just about anyone can build the next billion-dollar startup, whether it’s Uber for dry cleaning, or AirBnB for dogs.If this seems strangely familiar, that’s because it is. In 1999, at the height of the dot com bubble, there were billion dollar IPOs and acquisitions happening weekly, often of startup companies with non-existent business models based on “eyeballs” or “stickiness”. Who can forget Yahoo’s bonehead acquisitions of This time it’s a little different. Most of these companies have some revenue. Some even have a little profit. Fewer companies are rushing to IPO, and instead staying private for longer. But in many ways, it’s starting to feel like we’re partying like it’s 1999. We may not be there yet, and it may not take the same form, but something is most certainly brewing. As Mark Twain once said, “history doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme”.• This year, The Super Bowl had the • Today, there are • In the past year alone, Forbes has • • The • High profile investors like Bill Gurley and Marc Andreesen — both of whom rode the dot-com wave — think startup • The stock market is • Instead of going public — which is subject to rigorous auditing and regulation — many companies are • There are hundreds of new startups launching daily, so many that there are popular startups dedicated to keeping track of them. One such startup, Don’t take this the wrong way. I love startups and technology, and regardless of all this, there are a lot of amazing things happening. Artificial intelligence is showing signs of life. Self-driving cars are on the way, and drones may soon be delivering our toothpaste. There’s no doubt that there is an incredible amount of innovation happening right now.This isn’t to say that But hey, who knows? Maybe history isn’t going to repeat itself and exponential technology growth has kicked in. Maybe Uber is worth $500 billion. Maybe I’ll look back at this post in five years and cringe. All I know, is that I’m putting my swim trunks on…So, you’re concerned your startup might be at risk? Don’t panic. If the companies who lived to tell about the last bubble are any indication, here’s a couple steps you can take to help weather any potential storms:A lot of this is just common sense business fundamentals, but I’ve always been surprised by how few people in the tech world pay attention to this stuff. The past seven years have been good to startups — it’s been a non-stop feast. It’s easy to slip into thinking a huge round, lucrative acquisition, or IPO is just around the corner, but it’s a valuable exercise to think through what would happen if the music stopped.Founder of MetaLab (

For 6 years of my professional life, I worked only at startups. I saw myself as “the coder” — the guy that the brave hired to turn their ideas into real businesses. I never had the inclination to start my own… why would I risk a fairly comfortable life to pursue an idea that may not work?But then two years ago, I dived headfirst into running a startup — a code school in London — without really knowing what would happen. It was a fascinating, stressful and occasionally scary journey. In a few weeks time, I’ll be doing it all over again with a brand new startup.The tech industry is the only industry where you don’t need a business model. Imagine running a cake shop that gave away free samples but had nothing customers could pay for? Putting adverts on the wall wouldn’t save your bakery.Tech businesses can get away with this as they have the one thing most industries don’t: scale. The internet gives tech businesses an opportunity to reach potential customers thousands of miles away from their base.However this can be an illusion. If your business plan is based around having millions of users that don’t pay for things (or “eyeballs” as it’s called), there’s generally two things that may happen.Number one is that your startup makes it big and everything will be okay. Number two is that you’ll slowly struggle and spend all your money. The first option is a lot less likely to happen than the second. For some startups, it might be worth pouring your money into buying lottery tickets — it’s a lot quicker, less painful and has more chance of making your money back.There’s a balance to achieve with your market. Too niche and you’re in danger of having too few paying customers, and too broad and you might not be solving a particular problem. Watch It’s tempting once you have your idea to keep it to yourself. Other people might steal it, but if you’re not confident in your idea I don’t expect you to tweet your idea but if you’re making freelancers or advisors sign When I was freelance, I refused to sign NDAs as it could possibly affect any future work that I may get.Let’s say you NDA everyone so they can’t even talk about it and you launch without your idea leaking, what is to stop someone seeing your idea and making a better version? Google was not the first search engine and Facebook was not the first social network. Your startup needs to be the best-in-class, not the first to market.There is one great piece of advice in Tim Ferriss’s A lot of successful companies start out as different ideas. For example, Flickr was originally a photo-sharing chat room for gamers and on the extreme end of the scale, NokiaNaming things is hard — children, cats, dogs, plants — but naming a startup is particularly difficult. With web domains in ever shorter supply, the current process seems to be (1) think of a great name (2) check Make sure that your customers can spell your startup within 3 tries (think Once you have an idea, the next thing to do is sketch everything. If you’re making a site, draw all of the pages, and if you’re making an app, draw all the screens. Don’t skip any interaction — if you have a link or a button, what happens when you click it? Draw that too.This process gets the idea out of your head and on to paper. It also helps anyone else working with you, be it co-founder, investor, designer or developer, understand what you’re creating. For co-founders, it means that you can come to a consensus about what the idea is. For investors, they can picture what they’re giving you money for. For designers and developers, sketching helps them picture what they need to and how long it will take.People are the important part of your startup. More than your idea. Have an uncommited or irresponsible co-founder and your startup may as well not exist. Good founders know how to pivot and change things when they’re not working. Ideas are worthless and execution is key.You can do things as a solo founder but it’s harder. It’s always easier to work with your friends rather than finding someone to be your co-founder. You trust them, you know them and you have faith in their abilities. However, startups will strain even the most solid of friendships. Startups can be stressful and you may take your stress out on the nearest person.If you and your co-founders do the same role — for example, you’re all businesspeople or all designers or all developers—then you have to make your roles Co-founder fallouts are more common than most people realise. I left my first startup for that reason— it happens and you all just have to move on. There’s two very good articles on When I was freelance, I was asked weekly if I could join a startup as the technical co-founder. I generally didn’t know the person asking so I always said no.Coders can be arrogant and they believe that they can build the whole idea on their own. Which is true… to a point. Coding the idea is only a tiny part of doing a startup, there’s design, sales, marketing, admin and plenty more. But at the moment, you need them more than they need you.How do you differentiate yourself from other “Secondly, learn some skills to sell yourself to developers. Learning the basics of design and/or coding, so that you know what you’re talking about. You wouldn’t start a cake shop if you didn’t know how to cook — same thing applies to starting a tech company.I said earlier than I’m not a startup expert: I’m definitely not an expert in investment. However, You need a “runway” — the amount of time you need from starting your startup to it being profitable. This is going to be an estimate as most startups never lift off the runway. Your runway probably will be at least twice as long as you first predict so raise money accordingly. It’s easier and time-saving to do one big raise than several small ones.Raising money will also take a lot longer than you plan too. I’ve heard of startups taking a year to raise a round of money. Prepare for the worst.The best investors are advisors with money. What sort of investors will depend on what you’re creating. If you’re creating a tech product in a particular area, you can look for tech investors and investors in that particular area too.For early-stage startups, you will be looking to raise seed investment. Don’t bother trying the bigger companies like How much to raise again depends on your runway, your investors and also tax schemes. In the UK, look into As always, talk to people who’ve done it. Make contacts at startups who can advise you and talk you through the stages.There are a lot of different ways to build your tech startup if you’re not technologically skilled enough to do it yourself. You can either hire full-time staff, you can hire freelancers or you can outsource it to an agency.Without stating the obvious, on the Agencies survive on getting things out of the door. You will be one of many companies in their queue and their aim is to get you out of the door as quickly as possible. Agencies are also going to be the most expensive out of the options.I used to teach a 5 day long Ruby on Rails course. On the course’s last 2 days, I taught how to create a marketplace site where people could place ads and others pay for it. Think like AirBnb, Etsy and eBay. I anonymously contacted a few London agencies about how much they’d charge for all the features we do on the project. Three agencies replied and I received quotes between £35,000 and £60,000 (around $100k or €75k). Now, these figure were for a project I showed beginner coders how to make in 2 days. That version wasn’t all bells and whistles version but it wasn’t far off a Once you’re out of the door with most agencies, that’s it, no more help unless you’re on an expensive retainer. I’ve heard of horror stories of agencies charging £10,000+ a month in retainer fees.Freelancers are a way better option than agencies. They’ll be cheaper, care more and be a lot more receptive to you. Rough quotes for the project I mentioned earlier from freelancers were between £8,000 and £25,000 ($40k, €30k). They will also be more likely to have the flexibility to help you out longer term if you need them.Last, and definitely not least, are full time staff. They’re the hardest to find out of the options but probably the cheapest in the long term. They’ll be a big part of your team and Junior designers in London will cost very roughly £18–30k, senior designers £30–50k, junior developers £20–35k, senior developers £30–60k (where junior means less than 5 years experience). Salaries vary widely on location and experience.There’s also equity (shares in your company) to consider too. Most equity vests (gets given) over a couple of years — i.e. the staff member gets it based on how long they stay or if the company is sold. How much to give depends on a lot of things, how old the business is, how qualified that staff member is, how much money you’ve raised. There’s Why would I want to work at your When someone works for a startup, they’re giving up a lot of stability and possibly pay to work there. However, good people are not solely motivated by money, otherwise everyone would be working at banks and management consultants. Good people want to be part of a cause and a belief that what they’re doing will make an impact. It’s your job to convince them that your startup is going to make that impact.The best way to find people is as always by networking. Ask friends or make friends in the tech scene by going to events. For instance, in London there are events like Another way is to advertise. Sites like Startup job fairs can be great — I met a previous employee at A lot of soon-to-be founders ignore a big part of startup process — design. If you look at any popular site or app, you will notice how much effort has gone into not only the branding of the site but the whole user experience.If you’re not planning to hire a designer, I would definitely suggest getting a freelancer to create a brand identity for you. Having a strong brand is essential to make it successful in a crowded market. There are only a couple of tech companies I can think of that don’t have strong brands — I would advise against using something cheap like Next, read up on user experience. Read First versions of products always have a tendency to be too complicated. Be very wary of adding more and more features. Keep it as minimal as possible. Read (or re-read)As an example, at my previous startup, we launched with 7 different courses, including 4 that competed against each other. We quickly learnt that customers were getting confused between the difference so trimmed it down to just 2 courses which sold far better than having 7. Keeping it simple works. In the words of Gordon Ramsey, “If you are tempted to add features (and you will get tempted), do it one by one. It’s a lot easier to test if that feature works if you change one thing at a time rather than releasing several at the same time.Use services like Unless you or a co-founder is well known in your industry, your launch will be a quiet one. The opposite of “build it and they will come”. The next step is to get your startup’s name out to your audience.Read the great Depending on your startup and its industry, different techniques for sales and marketing will and won’t work for you:My mum works as a counsellor and she always says is that no matter how calm and relaxed a person might seem on the outside, underneath there’s a likelihood that they’re a panicked mess.

Enjoy the journey.Any founder will tell you, startups aren’t meant to be fun. It’s hard, stressful work and you’ll hit a lot of obstacles along the way. One day you might want to pack it all in, the next you’ll totally love it. You might become rich and famous or you might crawl out of the rubble of a failed startup.Don’t be scared of failure. It’s better to try and fail than never try at all. Many successful founders have had companies shut down before getting the formula right. Don’t think it as failure, This is your opportunity to make a dent in the world.

There are two big problems with reading about what made other companies successful:Google is one of the most successful companies ever. Google gives its employees the ability to spend 20% of their time on whatever they want. Therefore, 20% time is a great idea. Is it? Or was Google successful because they’re brilliant engineers who solved the right problem at the right time—killing it Companies are not built in a lab. We are unable to run Monte Carlo simulations. And there are way too many variables and too much randomness for anyone to claim that if you add ingredient X or do A then B then C it will work.What’s more, Side note: These problems apply whether the advice is first-hand (“Here’s what I did…”) or second hand (“Here’s how Google succeeded…”), though first-hand is generally better, because the vast majority of writing about what happened inside a company by someone who didn’t work there is not only biased, it’s highly likely to have the facts wrong.Even in a case where someone comes up with a truly great idea that improves the odds for many, many situations, it may be wrong for you. Your company is different. They all are. There are good ideas that apply to most companies, but I can’t think of any interesting ideas that apply to How about the least-controversial and most common advice ever given: “Only hire A players.” Here’s when that doesn’t apply: When you can’t hire A players. The truth is, A players aren’t available to most companies. If these companies stuck to the hire-only-A-players rule, they’d never hire anyone. Sometimes you have to get by with B players. That sucks, but here’s the thing: It doesn’t mean you can’t succeed. There a many examples of those who have, despite not being the absolute best in their field. (Again, there are As long as you understand the above, it’s fine—and even good—to read other’s stories and advice. There are two things you get out of it:We all need inputs from the outside.

These inputs will give you the occasional You should always be trying lots of things and getting ideas from everywhere.Reading about success doesn’t When I was young, I was looking for the keys to success. I would read business books and try to apply their secrets to success to my ventures. Needless to say, So, when you’re reading stories from and about So, keep reading (a tiny fraction of the time you spend doing). And start writing—no matter what your level of success—so others can get ideas and inspiration from you. Just remember this about the advice you read:CEO of Medium // 

When we launched By scouring the Web for interviews, videos, past profiles and more, we pulled insight from dozens of sources for each case study. Based on our research we were able to piece together what made these companies so successful—and in the process So now, with ten growth studies under my belt, I want to share ten things I’ve learned from these incredibly successful companies, to hopefully inspire you and shape your thinking when it comes to startup growth.If you want to read all ten case studies, You’ve heard plenty about product/market fit, and for good reason. While each of the ten companies we profiled have unique growth engines—they all have one thing in common: a ‘must-have’ product experience that creates loyal and happy customers who form the base of their success and the fuel for their growth.While some, like LinkedIn, needed to grow to critical mass to become a ‘must-have’ and others started out that way (like Evernote), each company fills a critical gap that previously existed for their users.Marc Andreessen has been quoted as saying (and I’m paraphrasing here) companies fail for two main reasons—trying to grow when they shouldn’t, or being too timid when they should. Product is the foundation of growth. Without it sustainable growth is impossible.All of these companies have a relentless focus on growth. It’s not just something they pay lip service to. They put headcount, resources and effort into growth. Ten years in and LinkedIn is still innovating on their growth engine. They have their share of misses, but the passion to find the next growth lever, and the next, and the next, is inspiring.One of the big takeaways with all of these companies is that none of them had a traditional marketing playbook. You won’t read about how they were masters of paid search or email marketing. Sure, many of them eventually added those competencies, but they weren’t what unlocked transformative and sustainable growth.Instead you’ll see that these companies had specific playbooks to drive growth—many that included marketing—but more often relied on the product for their biggest growth opportunities.These levers, like making the white Square card reader stand in stark contrast to black iPhones, or Evernote redesigning the entire product to meet a new appstore launch, are outside the realm of traditional marketers. The marketing teams don’t have this kind of leverage in companies.It takes real growth teams across engineering, product, and yes, marketing, to design the growth programs that really move the needle. Contrast this approach to the massive paid ad budgets of companies like Groupon, which were ultimately unsustainable.None of these breakout companies did it the same way that the incumbents grew in their vertical or type of business. They all picked their own path, often leaving people wondering what they were thinking. In The term growth hacking is in the hype cycle whitewash, as journos and others have misappropriated its meaning and assigned it to nearly every known digital marketing tactic. But while people still obsess over AirBnB and Craigslist, each of these companies found a unique insight or ‘hack’ to help grow their business. These aren’t hacks like RapGenius’s dumb link spam, these are really unique and thoughtful insights that lead to lasting growth.Their unique way of looking at things is what let them find their growth engines without investing tons of money into traditional marketing. HubSpot was one of the first to realize that building free tools could create massive inbound demand—far and above traditional social and content strategies.Uber and Belly both designed growth strategies which localized network effects to help solve marketplace liquidity challenges early on to grow. LinkedIn’s double viral loop is the thing of growth legend.Paul Graham’s advice to startups is to “Evernote realized that appstore launches were huge momentum points for the company and worked feverishly around platform announcements to be ready with new features so they’d be featured on stage or in the appstore at every launch. Certainly not scalable, certainly very powerful for distribution.At the same time these companies built systems and processes that could scale. For instance Lots of people track analytics. Plenty of dashboards, plenty of vanity metrics. Avinash Kaushik calls it ‘Companies like It has an asset—all the code—a network, and more. These things all work together to drive massive adoption and growth.Now GitHub is part of many developers’ workflows. It’s simply part of the stack, making its business incredibly defensible. Yelp has the community—a network—and an asset—the reviews. LinkedIn, similar story. Multiple engines can drive growth forward.None of these companies have a single silver bullet. They didn’t just explode into millions of users and downloads. Even the products that we think of as “magical” use meticulous growth strategies to drive adoption and growth.While in retrospect it seems like word of mouth carried them, a deeper look under the hood reveals that they were all engineered to grow in one way or another. Companies may catch lightning in a bottle, but it’s often always because they were prepared and working hard to align themselves to do so. Trying to find that silver bullet is fruitless and can be exceptionally costly.In the best growth organizations, sales and marketing aren’t firewalled from product, and engineering doesn’t consider marketing efforts spam. All of these teams work together to unlock growth and tap into these massive opportunities.After reading so much on these companies trying to narrow down to just a handful of core principles is incredibly challenging; but these insights are what stood out to me in the course of reviewing everything we created for this new ebook.Proud Dad, married to 

While Bill Gurley’s In a She replied privately, with some feedback I wasn’t ready to hear (when I first published this article I simply reference an anonymous quote, but Katelyn asked that I share more context):If you’ve been going through the same process of self-examination, here are some things I did to sanity check the way we’re spending.First, re-read Fred Wilson’s post from 2011 Fred’s post is from 2011, and many believe startup costs have risen a lot since then due to higher cost of living fueled by low interest rates. I asked “what is the average fully burdened cost per employee at Series A startups over time?” and Marc Andreessen guessed:At first I felt a bit superior for With $2.5M of funding in the bank this put us at 17 months of runway (all things remaining equal, 0 revenue growth and 0 spending growth).We’ve had two break even months. The first was by accident in October 2013 because we had an unexpected revenue spike. For a moment we felt what it would be like to completely control our own destiny. The second time was in February 2014, because low growth in December scared the living shit out of us and it didn’t look like our Series A was going to come together. My cofounders and I cut our salaries when we hit 3 months of remaining runway. There was no way in hell we would lose the incredible team we had meticulously built over the past six months.Getting to break even in February was subtly powerful. We demonstrated that we did have control, even if it felt a lot like drowning. After our failed Series A attempt we would go on to raise an If you’re setting out on the venture-backed path you need to do things that normal businesses don’t. To do this, you must put incredible stress on your fledgling business. It is generally believed that Internet startups need to grow fast because there is a perceived threat that if you don’t take the market quickly, someone else will. You need a market that is sufficiently large not because you need to take all of it, at least not initially, but because your company is going to be so bad at taking When Mattermark was just a tool for VC deal sourcing our total annual revenue opportunity could be measured in the tens of millions. For six months from October 2013 to March 2014 we held headcount steady at 9 people, even as MRR tripled, because it wasn’t time to pour on the gas.It was frustrating getting push-back on market size from investors, and somehow we knew if we Each founder’s job is to use investors’ money to increase the enterprise value of the business. If growing slowly and safely was what they were looking for, they would have been better off putting their money in a mutual fund. They’re expecting founders to figure out some secret hiding in plain sight and exploit it for massive economic gain, against all odds.It is scary to contemplate economic downturn, especially for those young founders who were in elementary school in 2000 and college in 2008. But the thing we’re scared of is the fear and uncertainty, not the actual pain. The pain sucks but you don’t die, and it does stop hurting. Those who struggled through 2008 are There are many things founders can’t control. Fortunately, we do control how we spend money and whether we make something people want. Investors are looking to us to make the right choices, to lead, to develop and protect a vision, and to be After all this analysis I’m feeling a little bit better, still slightly uneasy and as vigilant as always, but for now I’m going to keep moving forward with this course of action.

The frothiness of today’s environment in Silicon Valley makes it easy to get sucked into a warped sense of reality. Valuations are high, capital is cheap, housing prices are skyrocketing, and RSUs are flowing like wine.Talk of another “bubble” is rebuffed, even by those who were scarred by the Dot-com collapse of 2000. Some argue we’ve exited the installation phase of technology—which was still sputtering along at the dawn of the new millennium—and have entered what Carlota Perez calls the ‘deployment phase’ of technology. In this phase, startups move “up the stack”, switching from building core infrastructure (i.e. interstate highways) to applications that go on top of it (i.e. Teslas).Undoubtedly, changes in technology over the last 15 years have been breathtaking. The cost of bringing new products to market has dropped exponentially, and companies that hit product/market fit can build value incredibly fast through escape-velocity, engines of growth—going from worth nothing to worth billions, seemingly overnight. Unparalleled access to capital has led to an arms race for talent, with top tech companies stockpiling software engineers like ballistic missiles for the Tech Wars of the future.Companies are built on 5 to 10 year time horizons, so navigating the feast-or-famine fundraising environment and tracking jaw-dropping economic headlines across the globe are functions of survival. But when it comes to evaluating your own compensation and growth, focusing on the financial dimension is problematic because it’s too short-sighted.Since the time horizon for your career is long, the most valuable startup compensation you can acquire isn’t a competitive salary, a chunk of stock or a Yoga-laiden benefits package. If you look at the expected rate-of-return for each of these and benchmark them against the market, they aren’t dramatically different from what you could get working at the Your rate-of-learning is a better proxy for how successful you will be than your current salary or stock compensation because it’s a leading rather than lagging indicator. Abandoning the cubicle at your normal job to throw yourself head-first into a startup is a fiery accelerant for growth, changing your career trajectory by orders of magnitude through a substantially increased rate-of-learning. To explain why, let’s define ROL:In physics, velocity maps the relationship between speed and direction. In this case, the pace at which you are uncovering new insights (speed) has a direct relationship with the momentum you accumulate deploying these new insights (direction). Whether this process of aggregating and deploying insights is in the form of writing code or driving growth, scaling this steep learning curve is the forging process that turns you into a badass full-stack developer or Let’s use a real life example. Imagine you’re a growth marketer at a startup and uncover a new way to drive sign-ups by aggressively retargeting people who have visited your blog organically. You deploy the retargeting campaign and it works, so next, you find a way to generate more quality blog content by syndicating posts from experts in your space so you can attract even more eyeballs. Having successfully widened the top of your funnel, you switch gears and figure out how to dramatically increase conversion by personalizing sign-up page copy and background images based upon location data you’re pulling off a visitor’s IP address. This leads to another insight about a series of fields that can be moved out of the sign-up form and into the onboarding flow to reduce friction. The cumulative effect? You increase sign-ups by 20%.In a startup, this series of experiments can happen over the course of a few days. In the alternative universe of a normal company you might be waiting a week for a small retargeting budget or approval from your manager. Therefore the valuable insights that Another way to think about rate-of-learning dividends: the present value of money is low, especially when interest rates are at 0%, because you can’t generate as much compounding interest on money as you can on your learnings. So if you have a choice between getting paid $50K at a startup or $100K at a dying company, your future self will thank you for taking half the pay in exchange for a 3-5X ROL. A high rate-of-learning is the most bankable asset you can have in the startup world because it’s the vehicle by which longterm value is created, both within yourself and for your startup.Though it may seem like money is spilling all over the streets in Silicon Valley, don’t get distracted by shiny objects. Play the long game. Put yourself in a position to maximize your rate-of-learning, even—and especially—if it makes you a little uncomfortable. The long game is hard, but rewarding, because you’ll know you had the strength to make the steeper climb.Marketing Manager 

Essa é a história da minha participação pessoal no momento da fundação de uma startup da economia colaborativa, minhas principais críticas aos modelos e ao próprio conceito, uma percepção do mercado e o que me levou a abandonar tudo após uma desilusão ao propósito e missão que eu estava proposto a realizar. Senti-me compelido a compartilhar essa parte de minha trajetória após a repercussão do meu texto anterior, Para mim, a santíssima trindade das distopias é composta de Admirável Mundo Novo, 1984 e Laranja Mecânica. Estaríamos caminhando para uma distopia? E quem desses autores estava mais correto?Vai ser como Orwell escreveu, um mundo dominado pela vigilância repressiva e pelo estado de segurança que usaria formas cruas e violentas de controle? Ou como em Burgess, com violência desenfreada de jovens e programas de manipulação dos sentimentos e da personalidade através de alterações da química cerebral dos indivíduos? Ou talvez como Huxley anteviu, um futuro em que abraçaríamos nossa opressão embalados pelo entretenimento e pelo espetáculo, cativados pela tecnologia e seduzidos pelo consumismo desenfreado?Talvez cheguemos no futuro sombrio de Burgess, em que vamos começar a manipular diretamente a química de nossa natureza humana. Para mim, nosso mundo está longe de ser uma distopia. Mas, de uma forma ou de outra, Orwell e Huxley estavam certos sobre os nossos dias: A startup A ideia do Eduardo del Giglio era criar uma espécie de Task Rabbit, mas focado em limpeza. Por um tempo, o próprio Entrei para ajudar na construção do site. Não era algo que, à primeira vista, me animava muito a fazer. Na verdade, trabalhar com isso meio que me deixava desconfortável. Minha mãe sempre foi profissional de limpeza — até hoje trabalha com isso — e por isso eu sabia muito bem as dificuldades e problemas que existem na relação entre contratantes e clientes. Por ter sempre visto isso muito de perto, eu realmente só queria auxiliar nas operações por um tempo, dado o meu Eis uma Basicamente é aproveitar ativos que as pessoas possuem — carros, casas e até mesmo tempo — e fazer trocas com outras pessoas. Em alguns casos, as trocas são literais: eu te empresto minha casa e você me empresta a sua. Em outros, a troca é monetária: eu trabalho pra você por 5 horas e você me paga R$ 21,90 a hora. O AirBnb é um exemplo de economia compartilhada que funciona muito bem: dá uma função econômica e social para quartos, apartamentos ouespaços que de outra forma ficariam desocupados. O preço nem sempre é o mais acessível mas, em qualquer mercado, Algumas empresas se apropriam desse conceito para fins de marketing: seja colocando No início estava fascinado por fazer parte desse mundo. As profissionais de limpeza, eu racionalizava, já prestam esse serviço. Por um tempo, tenho de reconhecer, vivemos o sonho. Realmente aumentamos a renda de algumas pessoas, tivemos um impacto positivo, mas existem contradições e problemas no centro do modelo que o tornam insustentável e que me levaram, nos últimos dias de 2014, a pedir minha saída da startup.Confesso que sempre senti que as descrições geracionais lembram signos do Zodíaco: definições vagas, com leitura fria, baseado na data de seu nascimento e que descreveriam sua personalidade, seu comportamento profissional, em relacionamentos e, em sua última instância, o futuro.Uma das descrições da geração Y é que ela é eternamente insatisfeita e fica trocando de trabalho, sem respeito pela autoridade. Por isso, Eu não acho que o desejo de mudar de trabalho é algo que surgiu hoje. A inquietação sempre fez parte do espírito humano (vide qualquer história). Antes, entretanto, os custos sociais (de reputação) e os mecanismos das empresas não permitiam essa mobilidade entre empregos. Se hoje as pessoas ficam trocando de posições, é porque as empresas permitiram isso e, principalmente, ficaram tentando atrair novos talentos. Não acho que isso seja uma característica intrínseca da geração Y ou de qualquer outra. Vivemos um momento histórico que não apenas permite, mas cataliza um desejo que sempre foi presente. Em minha visão, quase tudo na vida são A Fast Company publicou um artigo no início do ano chamado “Como Sarah Jaffe escreveu no Guardian, as startups da E não podemos esquecer que a maioria dessas empresas encontra demanda em pessoas cada vez mais conectadas à todo instante e que demandam serviços e comodidades, antes luxos apenas reservados aos extremamente ricos, com a facilidade de um clique de um botão. A Re/Code fez uma extensa e muito interessante série de matérias sobre essa onda de Respondendo a essa demanda, e dentro de Durante o último ano eu trabalhava de segunda a segunda — não apenas no desenvolvimento do produto, minha área, mas no dia a dia das operações: atendendo clientes, auxiliando profissionais a chegarem a seus locais a partir das 6:00 da manhã, o que por si só é bem estressante, talvez o trabalho com maior Um dos artigos que me fizeram questionar tudo o que estava acontecendo ao meu redor foi publicado pelo Washington Post em setembro de 2014. Lembro de ter compartilhado o mesmo em meu perfil pessoal do Facebook e também de ter sido instruído diretamente a retirá-lo, para evitar potenciais problemas de associação ou mesmo com os investidores. Em Ou da Helpling, que anuncia faxinas com descontos nos metrôs de São Paulo, grifos meus:Ou seja, as startups que oferecem faxina e comodidade não se responsabilizam por nada, nem pela prestação do serviço doméstico. Ela apenas se responsabiliza, de bom grado, pelo pagamento e retenção das taxas que em alguns casos chegam a 45%.O própria A página com os termos de uso é o lugar onde as propostas de valor vão para morrer. Me pergunto o quanto disso não poderia ser considerado propaganda enganosa. Afinal tudo o que eles vendem, sua comunicação e páginas de design atrativo, é exatamente aquilo que eles deixam bem claro que não é de responsabilidade deles. Por exemplo, este anúncio comunica outra coisa:E é claro também que isentam-se de qualquer vínculo trabalhista. Algo que nunca consigo abstrair é que as plataformas de economia compartilhada sempre vendem a ideia de que as pessoas contratam serviços “sem intermediários”. Tente contratar um serviço por fora. Essas plataformas — ou vamos realmente dizer o nome deles, Destaco este parágrafo dos termos de uso da Helpling, disponível em Se o profissional de limpeza é um cliente, contratando a empresa e sem qualquer vínculo trabalhista, e que não vai ter compensação em caso de acidente de trabalho ou direito a férias, por que ele fica atrelado ao agenciamento da mesma? Se sou um cliente e contrato uma empresa para fazer algo para mim hoje, e eu paguei a ela, o que me impede amanhã de contratar outra ou realmente fazer a transação sem intermediários? Parece que a relação cliente-empresa só é interessante quando útil e conveniente. De resto, é a mesma relação de um empregado, é claro, sem nenhum dos encargos.A relação de poder que se estabelece é tão ou mais forte que a servil. Se antes tinham-se como desculpas o poder divino e quaisquer outras racionalizações para a escravidão, hoje as pessoas voluntariamente se colocam em servidão aos algoritmos, ao sistema, às plataformas, que sendo tecnologias, se passam por objetivos, por justos.A grande verdade, que pode ser confirmada por qualquer um que trabalhe com o modelo de negócios de marketplaces, é que encontrar pessoas dispostas a oferecer trabalhos, seja motoristas de carros de luxo, profissionais de limpeza, cuidadores de idosos, ou qualquer outra ocupação, não é o problema. Há sempre uma grande quantidade de pessoas que estão em busca de novas formas de ganhar mais dinheiro.Você poderia colocar 10.000 pessoas em um mês em sua plataforma anunciando nos lugares certos. O problema não é apenas quantidade, mas qualidade. Afinal, por mais que as startups não se responsabilizem em nenhum momento pelos serviços que prestam, é imperativo para elas que os serviços sejam de boa qualidade: para ter recorrência dos clientes pelos quais ela gastou um certo valor para adquirir e que esses divulguem no famoso boca-a-boca.Há diversas formas de tentar garantir a qualidade do serviço. A mais óbvia é um processo de seleção. Mas, por questões legais, não pode haver seleção. Lembrem-se, não existe vínculo trabalhista. As pessoas é que são clientes das plataformas e que buscarão empregos para elas. Usam-se vários sinais como empregos anteriores, referências para tentar fazer esse filtro e quando algo aponta para potenciais problemas, o sistema simplesmente não envia trabalho. Já que é um cliente e não poderia passar por um processo seletivo. É claro que exatamente o oposto é o dito para os contratantes. Afinal como o anúncio da Helpling ali faz questão de frisar, as pessoas querem contratar profissionais confiáveis.Uma vez a plataforma enviando trabalhos, todos os serviços, idealmente, recebem feedback dos contratantes. O padrão que observei é que mesmo quando o feedback é excelente, algumas vezes as pessoas não se dão ao trabalho de se manifestar, mas quando é medíocre (no sentido de mediano mesmo, ok?) elas vão avaliar e, se tiver algum problema, vão imediatamente exigir todo o dinheiro de volta, novo serviço, etc., — esta é uma área onde eu poderia me alongar mas não o farei, há pessoas que contratavam horas de limpeza humanamente impossíveis de se terminar suas residências e depois exigiam o dinheiro de volta, e por aí vai.Voltando aos sistema de feedbacks… Tenho um amigo que está trabalhando no Vale do Silício e usa o Uber diariamente para ir trabalhar. Ele me disse que conversa com os motoristas, todos imigrantes, que lhe falam que é necessário ter 4.6 de 5 estrelas em média para continuar recebendo corridas, acredito eu, em quantidade. Da mesma forma, todas as plataformas usam um ou outro sistema de reputação que impacta no recebimento dos trabalhos. As plataformas sempre partem da premissa de que é um algoritmo e que o sistema é quem determina quem trabalha. O que é claramente uma deliberada tentativa de mistificação de como a tecnologia funciona ou um profundo desconhecimento de como a tecnologia é construída.Há um fetiche muito grande com a tecnologia e há uma sensação de conforto para gestores e investidores em dizer que o algoritmo ou sistema está tomando uma determinada decisão. Claro, isso os isenta moralmente das mesmas. Mas é uma mentira. Algumas pessoas possuem uma fé cega e infundada em algoritmos. É uma automatização. E, o que para mim chega a ser um pensamento assustador, uma automatização com variáveis cujos não efeitos não entendemos plenamente —pois além dos desconhecidos conhecidos, o mais perigoso de tudo são os desconhecidos desconhecidos.Cada um pode ter a posição que quiser, em qualquer questão. Mas eu prefiro ficar com o diabo que eu conheço, com o qual eu posso dialogar e responsabilizar.Acredito que grande parte das dificuldades e problemas seja um sintoma da própria forma como as startups são concebidas. Com uma arrogante presunção de que podem resolver os problemas do mundo, sem completamente entendê-los, ainda depositam uma fé inabalável na tecnologia como agravante. O resultado é que muitas vezes os negócios criados repetem ou amplificam uma série de problemas que os modelos anteriores já possuíam e, que em alguns casos, já haviam sido corrigidos ao longo do tempo. Jovens privilegiados do Vale do Silício, com muito capital disponível, tentam causar disrupção em negócios sendo que desconhecem como faze-los. Parte do que Húbris é um conceito grego que desde que conheci me ajuda a explicar muito do que vi no ecossistema de startups brasileiro (aqui cabe o parêntese: eu sempre me incluo nessas descrições. Aponto o dedo para todos e também o aponto para mim). Como Em resumo:Como os gregos antropomorfizavam forças da natureza em deuses, peço que façam o oposto: troquem deuses por forças sociais, econômicas e culturais e terão a dimensão do sentido da palavra húbris para nosso contexto prático.Quando um modelo faz sucesso, as pessoas tentam aplicar para tudo. Um exemplo é o AirBnb. E aí, multiplica-se o número de iniciativas tentando aplicar o modelo de negócio para outros nichos. Basta ir a um evento da Startup Weekend, do qual já fui mentor e participo quando possível, para ver isso em ação. Dentro da proposta da Up Global de disseminar esses eventos para um primeiro contato com o empreendedorismo, acho a iniciativa excelente e louvável. É necessário estimular essas ações pois o empreendedorismo é uma força importante na geração de novos negócios — e de negócios que gerem valor.Entretanto, como não poderia deixar de ser, existem momentos em que encontramos extremos, como a fala abaixo de uma vencedora de um evento Startup Weekend que procurou a Germinadora em busca de investidores:Soa caricato e, para mim, chega até a ser engraçado, mas acreditem, ela Nós devemos criar um app para tudo? A tecnologia resolve todos os problemas? Como criar sistemas mais justos para todos e que não apenas explorem e aumentem as desigualdades entre as pessoas? Qual o impacto de fato das belas propostas de valor das startups?O que eu não tenho são respostas e nem soluções. Fico agora como um observador crítico de todo esse movimento. Esperando uma nova startup, talvez chamada O youPIX é parte do Empreendedor, criador, autor, nerd.

Startups are about potential. The potential to build something great, the potential to make people’s lives better, the potential to change the world. However, I often see this potential get in the way of the present with some of the early stage startups I meet. They let their vision for the future invade their present too soon.The most obvious symptom is a bloated and unfocused product. I believe founders are afraid that their core idea isn’t smart enough, isn’t big enough, isn’t useful enough — so they add. It is this fear that leads to the rationalization for adding feature after feature in the hope that the sum will be greater than the parts. Founders are very good at convincing themselves that users will need this feature or that feature without actually knowing as such. Expecting to stumble upon a killer feature is a fools errand, that results in a product riddled with half-baked features collecting dust.A good product is not a bucket of features, a mere bulleted list of things users can do. A good product is an exercise in exclusion. A good product is defined as much by what it doesn’t do as by what it does. This is especially true at the start. At the onset, people don’t care about you, they don’t know what you do, and they certainly won’t put up with a confused product. This apathy must be acknowledged and combated in a product that does one thing extremely well; otherwise it won’t stick.When the product is merely a half-baked idea the excitement leads to idea after idea, cool feature after cool feature. It is hard evaluating the relative importance of these ideas in the glow of creation. The urge is to do it all, but the critical step is to realize most features are not absolutely necessary in the beginning, and that adding them can be destructive.At the start, more features means more apathetic users. Every feature a user encounters adds to what is referred to as ‘cognitive load’. This added cognitive load will retard user adoption because there are more actions for users to comprehend and use than their level of engagement will permit. Users are deciding whether to leave your site, not how to take advantage of all your features.Fear leads these startup founders to add. They add and add. Each additional feature can be rationalized on its own, but what is often left unconsidered is the true impact of these features on the product as a whole. More features require more code. More features require more design. More features lead to more user confusion. More features lead to less focus.Startups need to be confident in their core idea. The idea should be sharp and pointy, an idea that lodges itself in people’s brains where no other idea has already taken up residence. The more they add, the more they do, the harder it is to own a unique spot in people’s minds. Features upon features is a downward spiral. Features are not the magic bullet, stop treating them that way.On Twitter – 

In startup land, if you build a sustainable profitable business that is not growing greater than 50% a year, everyone will respect you individually, but few will respect the actual profitable, sustainable business. Seek their respect at your own risk.If doing what you love (in my case making Internet products that help people connect) allows you to make a business out of it, you’ll end up hating what you created because all you get to do is manage a very complex, challenging business.If you If you have enough courage to run your own business, it is roughly 1,000,000 time more rewarding than any job available, assuming you can make enough money and value out of it.If you hire friends you will have to work 2x as hard at maintaining your relationship as before, or you’ll likely be neither friends nor coworkers for long.If and when you are rude, disrespectful or go over the line with a team member, no matter the reason, apologize right away. Explain why it happened, why it was wrong, and be sincere about it.When you’re out at an event and someone asks how you are doing, avoid the temptation to tell the truth, as you might horrify them. Save the specifics for friends of the business. Hire slow, fire fast.Fuck up fast.When communicating with investors do not share good news until it’s a done deal. Nothing worse than having to answer you got left at the alter when an investor asks how the big new partnership is going. (But also see @Sacca’s note to the right. Don’t withhold bad news, be the person your investors hear it from first.)Business partnership contracts are not to lock in your upside. They are to defend against downsides. You are responsible for creating and ensuring your own upside, no matter how the contract is worded or what you think you’ve gotten them to agree to.Build goodwill whenever possible. If you’re not getting a lift up by someone, you should be giving someone else a hand up.Be polite. A public thank you by twitter is almost as good as a hand written notecard if you do it sincerely.Be careful about letting your mouth run at those open bar events ;)Industry distractions can be brutal. If you’re having a hard time focusing on your own destiny, tune out channels like twitter and start-up blogs. While you may read 10 things a day that you think might be able to help your business, if something actually will, 3 different people will email it to your inbox.Recessions and economic downturns are easier periods to compete than periods of strong economic fundamentals.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every startup founder wants to find and collaborate with the right advisors in hopes of solving their most pressing problems. Despite everyone’s best intentions, the more advising relationships we see across our 250+ companies and beyond, the more convinced we are that the traditional advisory model is broken for both founders and advisors.Founders have trouble getting tangible value from advisors given these relationships are typically 2+ years in length and often exist around no more than a handful of coffee meetings. A vast majority of startups have 5 to 10 general advisors who take equity and end up as nothing more than names on a slide deck. There aren’t specific deliverables or standardized ways to work together. No one knows what fair economics look like.And it’s not any better for advisors. We often hear that “It’s too hard to find the right entrepreneurs to work with,” or “It’s too much of a time commitment.” “It’s unclear what role I should play,” or “It’s awkward to negotiate pay or equity.”In most cases, it ends up being expensive, wasteful, and frustrating for everyone involved.For all these reasons and more, we’re announcing an experiment to fix traditional startup advising. The first part of our early solution is something we call As we get closer to perfecting the ideal solution, we expect to open-source the STAR contract documents, compensation agreements and our key learnings to the entire startup community.While we think STAR will help fix a lot of the problems with traditional startup advising, it’s not a complete solution — it doesn’t solve the challenge of finding the right experts when startups need them most. Over the last decade at First Round, we’ve seen the power that comes from connecting the right person with the right company at the right time to solve a specific problem.That’s why in addition to a new model, we’re launching our own Expert Network for First Round companies. The What we think will make the First Round Expert Network so unique is our focus on identifying specialists who can solve short-term problems vs. pairing founders with high-level generalists who have historically occupied advisory roles. Startups move fast and their biggest challenges change week to week and month to month. It’s questions like, “What is the right way to structure a SaaS sales team?” or “What’s the best way for an ecommerce company to negotiate with carriers for optimal shipping rates?” or “How should I launch our consumer product to the public for the first time?” and thousands more that founders need to address now.To help us tackle this big problem, we’re thrilled to share that Lastly, like many of our Reimagining VC from the ground up to help founders win.

It’s been almost four years since I joined the team at Gaiam TV. I started just weeks before we launched and have now been through countless improvement cycles, a few failed experiments, one full redesign, and the incorporation of two acquisitions. Along the way we’ve grown into the largest streaming yoga service in the world and I’ve learned a few things about leading a design team and succeeding in a startup.When the team is small everyone has to play lots of roles. Job descriptions are more like rough outlines (at best). Success comes for you, and the team, when you are prepared to do what needs to be done to move the company forward, even if it does not always align with your job title.Be flexible with your design process. Things move fast in the early stages. Being dogmatic about your process will set you up for endless headaches and put you at risk of being labeled as ineffective or obstructionist. Having a diverse set of design approaches in your repertoire will give you the flexibility to move quickly without sacrificing all of your principles, but also be methodical when time allows. Eventually the time will be right to put some rigor in place. Until then, being flexible will help you figure out what does and does not work for your team.We all want to be data driven. We all want to make decisions based on research and analysis. But sometimes you have to let go of that desire. Early on, you probably won’t have much budget for research. You also might not have a real data analyst on staff. Instead, you have to be scrappy. Talk to your users, observe what you can and be willing to have faith in your instincts. Sometimes you’ve just gotta go with what feels right and see what happens.As head of product you spend your days balancing short term needs with long term strategy. Often this means “selling” your view of the future, especially if everyone is not in alignment. For me, a big part of this process is what I refer to as “planting seeds”.Everyone’s view of the product trajectory evolves at different rates. This means that some things that may seem obvious to you might not even be in the consideration set for others. If you have an idea of where things should be going, one way to move things along is to just start talking about it. Don’t worry if it is fully formed, and don’t make the conversation something formal. Talk about your ideas early and talk about them often. Like a seed, an idea can’t grow until you plant it. Talk to anyone who will listen.Planting seeds achieves two things. 1) It makes your ideas better by vetting them through multiple viewpoints. 2) If an idea has merit, it helps it take root in the organization. It gives people time to wrap their heads around how an idea might impact their part of the business, and because they were part of the conversation early it allows them to put their stamp on it and feel a level of ownership. This way, when the time comes to make decisions it’s more likely that everyone will be aligned. The process can take time (literally months sometimes), but be patient and keep talking. If an idea is solid, eventually it will sprout.The world is overflowing with resources about the latest best practices, lessons learned and the hottest new design and business trends. You could spend all your waking hours reading and still not get through it all. A lot of these articles, books and videos have great insights and can shed light on things you may not have considered. But it is important to remember that no two organizations, and no two products, are exactly alike. Keep yourself aware of emerging trends and lessons learned, but be sure you always consider the unique complexion of your product, organization and target market before you apply them (these five included ☺).Director of Product Design 

As a designer at IDEO who focuses on building businesses, I’m always seeking inspiration from startups. How do they craft compelling offers? Eek out a competitive advantage? And how can I bring that intel to our clients and set them up for success? Last night, I attended a food tech event, “Navigating from Clicks to Mouth,” which featured well-known startups like Startups face many of the same challenges established companies do, so learning how they stare down those obstacles helps me work through possible risks, plan for contingencies, and find hidden pockets of value in design recommendations for clients.Here are fourIf I’m designing a new delivery service, for instance, I could explore how keeping the fleet low-cost and low-tech — say, using bicycles — would allow investments in other areas, like high-touch customer service or proprietary packaging.For instance, Chipotle tested Sofritas, a vegetarian protein, in seven restaurants in San Francisco before expanding to additional locations in California, and then nationwide. Mindful of the appeal of their simple menu and fast service, Chipotle made sure that the new menu item was popular enough to justify complicating the serving process.If I were designing a new digital concept, I would prototype with a bare-bones version of A great example can be found in Designing a new business is hard work, even for an established company with a ton of resources.

The call came into our system at exactly 12:00:01AM, January 1st, 2015 (Tri-Cities time).It rang a few times, before anyone actually noticed it. We were too busy high-fiving each other and ringing in the New Year with our noise-makers and illegal home-made fireworks on the beach to realize the momentous occasion that was about to intrude into our otherwise stable corporate lives as a small struggling startup.“Hello?” I answered, tentatively—and more than a bit drunkenly.“Who is this?”Nothing came up on the caller ID.I assumed it was our FOIB fooling with the phone lines again.“Ted, if this is another one of your practical office jokes…”A robotic voice sounded…“At the tone, your company will have been bought by Google…”Followed by a I looked at the screen—I joined the others back at the bonfire made up largely of extra office furniture and unimportant financial documents.“Guys, I just had the weirdest call…”Ted Smith looked up from his daiquiri, eyes twinkling. It must have been him that set this up somehow as a gag.“Who was it?” he asked, innocently.“Google,” I said. “Or someone pretending to be them.”Ted said nothing.It was Roger who finally asked, “Well, what did they want?”“They said they’re buying our company. That they already bought it, in fact…” I repeated what the robotic voice had said to me. We all looked at each other, one to the next then, in silence.Richard, looking pensive in his over-sized sombrero and copious Hawaiian leis and bead necklaces, took a long slow sip of his enormous margarita.“If you guys are messing with me…” I started, “then, well done.” I looked at Ted.“Not me,” he said, seeming suddenly very serious. I believed him for some reason.“Me neither,” Roger said. “You know I’m no Gimgle-lover…”That’s always what we called it. Simultaneously a euphemism and a safe-word, a shield so we could speak about Using brute force methods, it was technically “Richard, what do you think?”He paused, and said only, “How much?”“They didn’t say.”Burt laughed out loud, spitting a combustible puff of mai tai over the now roaring bonfire, “They bought our company, but didn’t tell you for how much? Some negotiator!”“Hey—” I started to argue, but realized he was right. Their automated buy-out agent had painted me into a corner, given me literally no chance to respond.And now, here we were in a hostile takeover. How could this have happened? We had been so careful to fly under the radar for so long—to avoid this exact situation. I felt like such a failure.“Well, what’s done is done,” Roger said, always the voice of reason. “The important thing is: what happens next?”“We have no other choice,” I said. “We have to call Nick. His people will be able to find out what’s going on.”Ted patched us in through the central office as fast as you can say “Hey, Happy New Year! Where are you guys?”“We wish it was a Happy New Year, Nick, but we’ve got a big problem on our hands…”“What? What’s wrong?”“We’ve just been bought out by Google.”“That’s fantastic! Congratulations! Oh my god!”Nick was, you could say, our tech godfather, our ‘man on the inside.’ He was “It’s not fantastic, Nick. It’s everything we’ve always avoided as a company—it’s everything we’ve “Well, how much are they giving you guys at least?”“That’s just it, we don’t know. It was their hostile takeover robot that called. They’ve won. They have everything now…”“Hey now, that’s no way to think at a time like this. Let me see what I can find out. I’ll phone you back.”While we were waiting for Nick to phone us back, Burt whipped up another round of ‘Tequila Zingers’ which we toasted—on Ted’s suggestion—Nick, meanwhile, was frantically trying to raise on social media someone from his professional network who might either be ex-Gimgle (his office was positively We waited there on the beach outside Great Wolf Lodge with mixed degrees of drunken revelry and dreadful expectancy.Finally, the Red phone rang. I gulped and picked it up.It was Nick.“Listen, I wasn’t able to access the file. This is sealed up tighter than a drum, with orders from the higher-ups directly. You’re just going to have to wait this one out—and hey, try to enjoy yourselves after all. It’s New Years and you just sold your startup. You should be celebrating, not moping! They’ll take good care of you, you’ll see. “Okay, Nick, thanks,” I said, leaden and dead inside. “Happy New Year to you too.”“You know he’s right,” Burt said. The Tequila Zinger was obviously taking effect. “We can figure this all out tomorrow…”Tomorrow couldn’t come soon enough.First thing in the morning the next day, I woke up. I wasn’t sure of the number, but I dialed GOO-GLE onto my bedside rotary phone (I don’t believe in radiation-transmitting wireless devices in the home).Sure enough, an operator picked up.“Is this… “Yessir, one moment please.”The operator didn’t bother to ask how she could direct my call. She knew already who I was, why I was calling, and probably everything else about me. Probably, she knew me better than I knew myself.It was like waiting to speak with God.Hold music. One of their customer service agents picked up the line.“Good morning, sir and Happy New Year,” they sounded chipper. Chipperer than I’m sure I sounded replying.“Yes, thanks. Happy New Year to you. Look, the reason I’m calling—”Chipper broke in, “Oh, I know the reason you’re calling, sir. Welcome to the Google family.”“Yes, b-but, how much—” “I’m sorry sir, I don’t have that information.”“You don’t? Who does?”“One moment please.”“I’m transferring you to my manager, sir. He’ll be able to answer all your questions. Oh, and sir, have an excellent day!”Manager, finally. Thank God.“Welcome to Google, sir. We’re delighted to have purchased your company. How can I help you today?”“Hi, thanks. Uh, I’m calling to find out how much you’re giving us. The robot that called me last night, uh, didn’t give us a lot of details, and we’re kind of…”“I understand completely, sir. Let me just look this up for you.”“Sir, there’s no purchase price in our record. What did you say your company’s product or service is again?”“Look, if you people wanted to buy us out and you don’t even know what our company does, I’m not going to explain it to you!”“I’m sorry, sir. I know how you must be feeling. Unfortunately, there’s no human that decided to buy your company. It was an intelligent algorithmic assessment, which was executed by an automated agent. Would you like me to look up which keywords you used on your website or business description which probably triggered the takeover?”“Thank you for holding, sir. I queried our system and have a few possible matches that I’d like to review with you so that we can determine your field of service, and get settled on the purchase price.”“Okay, fire away.”“Sir, does your business use the word ‘the’ on it’s website?”“What? Are you kidding? Of course!”“That’s probably it, sir.”“But ‘the’ is one of the fundamental words in the English language! Are you telling me Google goes around and just automatically buys any company which dares to use the word ‘the’?”“I’m not currently authorized to disclose those details our business plan at this time, sir. But I can tell you that it’s not always what you say, but “Well, how did we use the word ‘the’ that somehow forced Google into buying us out without us even getting a word in on the matter?”“Okay, sir. Is it possible that on your business website you used the word ‘the’ in conjunction with the word ‘technology’?”“I-I guess it’s… possible.”“Perfect, sir. So you’re a technology company then?”“Yes, uh, no. I mean, I don’t know. I guess so…” I stammered, remembering finally to add, “What does that mean? How much are we worth to you like this?”“Oh, a lot, sir. A lot.”“How much, exactly?”“Sir, we have a very generous package available for technology companies like yours joining the Google family.”“And that is…?”“Well?”“One moment, please”“Thank you for holding, sir. I have a few more questions to ask about your company to determine your potential worth to us. Sir, is your company a ‘high tech’-type company?”“You’ve got to be kidding me!”“No, sir. I’m quite serious.”“High tech? What does that even mean? Look, we never wanted to sell our startup to you. We’ve taken active measures to avoid being acquired…”“I’m sorry you’re frustrated sir. Are you saying you won’t sell to Google?”“What? No, I’m—yes, I mean, I—”“I’ve just been authorized by our algorithms to double our previous offer.”“There is no previous offer!” my hands were shaking. “Just a mysterious call from a robot on the first second of New Year’s Eve saying that at the tone, we were being purchased by Google…”“I’ve just been authorized to triple our previous offer sir, and add in a free ‘coupon book’ you can use around our corporate campus. Do you accept?”“And if I hold out for more?”“Sir, I’ve never seen the algorithm authorize me even to offer the free coupon book before this. The situation is entirely unprecedented. The system has entered a completely unpredictable state. I suggest you accept.”“Two coupon books.”Silence.Finally, “Sir, I’ve just been authorized to make a final offer of triple our original asking price and one FULL coupon book to each member of your staff. But sir, I’m also being informed—this is our final offer.”“Deal.”And the rest, as they say, Leveraging Infinite Growth

Investing time in finding the best talent for your startup is crucial. Yet if you’re an entrepreneur, time is your most precious commodity. So how do you maximise time spent searching for great people? Here’s a simple trick we’ve been using at Screen your applicants based on their LinkedIn profile / cv (your preference but I prefer LinkedIn as I don’t want to be marketed to). Then with your shortlist, ask them to send you What happens next is where the magic happens. When we tried this in our latest round of hires, most people didn’t bother to write ten questions and so never applied. Then about a half sent questions that you could have asked about any job, literally they could have been applying to the crocodile trainer job at Score the questions — if all questions the questions sound like the top ten things you’ve been grappling with in the last 6 months, get them in. If it’s less than 7/10, then ask for 5–10 more. Yes, ask for more questions. You’ll feel uncomfortable doing this, but believe me, if they can’t think of at least 5 more questions about the job, they just aren’t trying hard enough.Everyone I spoke to in our recent hiring round said they loved the approach and had never seen it used. I asked one recent applicant if they understood why I’d taken this approach, and they said:What tactics have you found useful either applying for jobs or hiring for great people?Communities, Collaboration  Creativity.

At Other Machine’s primary mission is to put Until very recently, computer-controlled mills were prohibitively expensive; CEO Danielle Applestone sees the Othermill as the perfect empowering device for a time-constrained engineer looking to prototype a new part, or an Etsy shop owner eager to ramp up production of some key component, or any do-it-yourself dreamer cooking up a wild idea in a basement workshop. “Everyone can be a manufacturer,” says Applestone.That empowering mission puts Other Machine at the heart of the “Maker” movement, that much-hyped intersection of DIY hobbyism and digital-era tools. Scores of similar startups abound in the Bay Area and beyond. It’s a Silicon Valley trope — give the people cool tools and watch them go crazy.But what makes Other Machine stand out from its colleagues is how the company itself is an empowerment factory. Other Machine isn’t just building a tool to unlock creative potential through the “democratization” of manufacturing. It’s also building a corporate culture to achieve something even more desirable, to demonstrate how women don’t just belong, but are absolutely poised to flourish in a technology industry all too eager to make excuses for its testosterone imbalance.“They called me the ‘mosquito,’” recalls Danielle Applestone, with a grimace.“They” were some of her fellow graduate students in the material sciences lab at the University of Texas at Austin, where Applestone was pursuing a doctorate in the mid-2000s after receiving her bachelor’s degree from MIT. As lab manager — a position she had volunteered for — it was Applestone’s job to make sure that the lab’s 15 workers followed the proper protocols for disposing of hazardous waste and using the lab’s equipment safely.The lab included advanced tools for analyzing potentially toxic chemicals and pressurized gases; the potential for a disastrous mistake was non-trivial. So Applestone made sure everyone followed the rules, with a relentless persistence that apparently stirred some annoyance from her overwhelmingly male co-workers. Her mere appearance would catalyze the muttering: “Oh no, here comes the mosquito.”Applestone shrugs off the experience even as she recounts it, noting that other women she knows encountered obstacles in their careers that were “much, much worse.” And to be sure, when compared to some of the truly vile rhetoric that routinely confronts women who venture into traditionally male domains on the Internet, being likened to a mosquito might seem to carry just a tiny sting.But ask any woman who has worked in the technology industry and you will hear tales of similar “micro-aggressions,” little digs that, over time, contribute to an unwelcoming atmosphere. Researchers who have studied the experiences of women in technology report that expectations for what are considered “appropriate” gender roles form very early on in life. The workers at Applestone’s lab were not used to having a woman tell them what to do. But there’s also a moral to the mosquito story.“The thing that made the culture get better [at UT] over time,” says Applestone, “the thing that mattered, was that any time there was an issue, I brought it up with my boss, he listened to me, then he brought everybody into his office, and gave everybody a talking to, and things got better. We had to repeat that process a couple of times, but it made all the difference.” Exit surveys conducted by technology industry employers after women quit their jobs Interviews with Applestone and her employees, both male and female, reveal several different, potentially replicable strategies for nurturing a technology workplace that women find collegial and respectful — to the point that, as Other Machine web developer Cassy Jens told me, “I brag about it to my friends all the time.”It starts with the hiring process. Applestone doesn’t just pick through the applicant pool that comes to her; she goes out and actively looks for qualified women.There’s no question that the pool of applicants contains more men than women — a fact that undoubtedly makes it more difficult for a Google or Facebook to achieve gender parity than a small company like Other Machine. Yet Applestone reports that the culture she is creating has turned out to be a potent recruiting tool: “The ladies know where the ladies are.”Some of Applestone’s initiatives are small, such as her determination to avoid obviously gendered language. (She recalls, ruefully, telling a couple of her employees that the company needed more “manpower” and then realizing she had made this comment to two women.)Other efforts have more obvious impact. She screens potential employees for a quality she calls “technical empathy” — a capacity to think about the company’s product design beyond its technical merits, and instead, speak to a sense of “connection” with the needs and capabilities of consumers and co-workers, as well as the larger mission of the company. One of the benefits of putting together a team with high technical empathy, says Applestone, is that “there is not a mansplaining bone in our body.”Perhaps the most crucial aspect of Other Machine’s corporate culture to emerge from conversations with its employees is the sense that at this startup, nobody is going to be labeled a mosquito. This is not a company where micro-aggressions will fly. This is a company where the first bedrock rule is that nobody gets interrupted, and the second is that everyone gets their say.“The dynamic in meetings is the most important thing,” Applestone says, “because that is the thing that you do every day, every week — it is the reinforcement of what the culture is. You sit around the table and you speak — and the way you address others and the way they address you is reinforced every single day.”Applestone says that “one of the most satisfying things” about being the founder and CEO of Other Machine is that she was able to personally write the Employee Handbook. With a wealth of experience dating back to her own struggle as a single mother in graduate school, she made sure things would be different, and better. “I was able to say I want this, and I want this, and I want this,” recalls Applestone.When Other Machine’s Alana Yoel majored in mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon, she recalls that out of a total of 120 students in her “Intro to ME” class, “at most” 20 were women, and during her entire four years there, all but two of her professors were male. “All of the friends I did my homework with were men,” she says. “It was very intimidating.”When Jens, the company’s web developer, was majoring in computer science at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, only one out of 10 students in her classes were female. At her last job she was the only female software developer.Yoel and Jens’ education and work histories are the norm in the tech industry. According to Even more perturbing, though the percentage of women in engineering jobs has been creeping up slowly over the last 50 years (from 1 percent in 1960 to 12 percent today), the percentage of women in computer science has actually fallen from its early 1980s peak. Even as women have surged towards parity with men in the fields of law, medicine and biology, in computer science women have been in retreat. The numbers released over the last year by Silicon Valley’s biggest corporations are The explanation for how this state of affairs came to be is complex and contested. To date the best stab at putting all the pieces together is the AAUW’s 141-page report, released March 26 and titled “Solving the Equation: The Variables for Women’s Success in Engineering and Computing.” By far the most comprehensive look at recent research on gender diversity in the technology industry, the report doesn’t resolve easily to a single smoking gun. Indeed, just the act of summarizing it runs the risk of drastic oversimplification.But when read with Other Machine in mind, some intriguing insights pop into focus. Perhaps most encouraging, the current comparative lack of gender diversity in engineering as compared to other sciences may actually be something of a historical accident.The report cites the research of Amy Bix, a professor of history at Iowa State University and author of “Girls Coming to Tech!: A History of American Engineering Education for Women.” I called Bix up, and she told me that “the thing a lot of people don’t realize is that the history of women in engineering is significantly different from the history of women in either science or medicine.”Women, says Bix, have always had a place — albeit small — in science and medicine. Women’s colleges such as Smith and Vassar boast a long tradition of teaching the sciences. The nursing profession offered a natural path to increasing female professionalization in medicine. Over the last several centuries, the occasional woman has emerged from time to time in various scientific fields. (Marie Curie being by far the most famous example, but not the only one.)But the modern specialization of engineering, says Bix, traces its roots back to the military and heavy construction, two domains in which women were almost completely absent. “It’s no coincidence that the first engineering school in this country was actually West Point,” Bix says. The way it evolved as a discipline “made the link between engineering and masculinity much more deeply rooted than the link between masculinity and either science or medicine,” she says.Deeply rooted, but not intrinsic. Applestone, for one, credits her career path to her childhood circumstances. As a kid who grew up poor in rural Arkansas, she simply didn’t know about the gender bias in science and technology.Applestone was raised in an environment shaped in part by the fact that her father was constrained to a wheelchair when she was a child. He had a well-equipped workbench but limited ability to use it. Applestone was his proxy. When he conceived of a plan to retrofit the house so he could move around more easily, she executed it.“My dad and I built everything,” she says. “I was so out of the norm I didn’t even realize that there was a women-in-tech issue. I just thought that if you could make things and show people that you were a hard worker, you could get pretty far.”As a middle schooler, she learned during a two-week summer science camp that the state was about to start a new math-and-science magnet school free to anyone who could pass the stringent admission requirements. She spent the next two years doing everything in her power to ensure that she got accepted. “I just decided that’s what I had to do with my life,” she says.She repeated the same single-minded process with the only college she applied to, MIT. She besieged MIT with supplementary application materials — a recording of herself playing guitar and saxophone; a photo portfolio of the horses in her neighborhood.In graduate school she found herself solo-parenting a young son as she struggled to finish her dissertation. The ordeal forced her to quit graduate school twice before she could see it all the way through.Now she feels a responsibility to pay forward all the encouragement she’s received from her mentors along the way. “If you are a woman anywhere where there isn’t equality, it is your job to do as much as you can possibly do to address it,” Applestone says. “Because that’s the only way we’re going to get out of it.”There’s a resonance between Applestone’s formative experience — a father who encouraged her to pick up tools — and a life-changing moment cited by Alana Yoel, who operates the machines that make the parts for the Othermills. At an all-girls high school in Philadelphia, Yoel volunteered to lead a team in a national robotics competition. No one at the school hinted that this might be an inappropriate role for a girl; in fact, Yoel mused that she might not have been quite as eager to take on responsibility, or risk failure, if she had been part of a mixed-gender team with boys who might have had more preexisting knowledge about robotics. After starting college at Carnegie Mellon, she recalls thinking that her male colleagues seemed to have vastly more experience. “I felt like they were so far ahead of me. It was tough.”But like her eventual boss, she persevered. “I liked the challenge of being one of the only women in the program,” she says, “I think I wanted to prove that I could do it.”Midway through my second interview with Danielle Applestone in mid-March, a bell rung that could be heard throughout the entire building. Everyone stopped what they were doing, applauded, and then promptly returned to work.“That means we just sold a machine,” says Applestone. “And that’s our thirty-second sale today, which makes today our biggest day ever.”Thirty of those sales, Applestone explains, came from a single order from an educational institution, testament to the Othermill’s potential as not just a tool for making things, but as a tool for introducing people to the entire universe of advanced manufacturing.Other Machine is a spinoff from an incubator called Griffith offered Applestone the job of turning the DARPA grant into a working prototype. But the road got rocky, fast. Not long after the project started, the budget logjam in Congress that led to the “sequestration” debacle caused Other Machine to lose its DARPA funding. Applestone orchestrated a successful Kickstarter campaign to keep the company alive, and although she says it is on pace to sell enough machines to be “cash-neutral,” she’s still looking for the necessary venture capital investment to ensure sustained growth.Yet the core notion of Othermill as an educational tool — something more than just a profit generator but a thing that could actually change lives — is likely key to Other Machine’s gender success story. It also jibes with one conclusion of the Solving the Equation report: that the opportunity to make a real difference in people’s lives is especially meaningful to women.“Many researchers,” states the report, “have found a perceived difference in the value that women and men place on doing work that contributes to society, with women, on average, more likely than men to prefer work with a clear social purpose… [Another report] found that the desire at age 20 to have a job that helps people is a very strong predictor of both women and men completing a major in the biological rather than the physical sciences or math and working in biological or medical occupations rather than physical science or engineering occupations at age 25.”As Jens, the web developer, told me, “I wanted something that overlapped with ideas that I cared about.” That sentiment could have been lifted straight from the Solving the Equation report.And maybe, if all goes as planned, the spread of tools like the Othermill, along with the increasing visibility of role models like Applestone, will mean that in the not so distant future the next generation of Cassy Jenses and Alana Yoels aren’t vastly outnumbered by men in their college engineering and computer science courses.“When you make tools accessible to everyone,” Applestone says, “that necessarily means they are accessible to all genders. And if they are deployed in places where kids can learn how to use them when they are young — not just boys, but also girls, then more women will be exposed to them.”“And they will realize, hey, this is awesome. Hey, this is a thing that is possible.”20-year veteran of online journalism, formerly a lifer at Salon, now untethered. On Twitter Mining the tech world for lively and meaningful tales and analysis.

You’re looking for that Dropbox-like “Well here is a secret, those shots-in-the-dark are just that — There will be a stunt, a key, a jolt, every now and then that can potentially spark a viral trend for a company, but they are hardly consistent and seldom reachable without some beautifully creative inspiration and a unique use-case. If you’re really looking for one of those keys, look more closely at the unique opportunities your product gives, where it lives, and where your customer’s use-cases are. Now, if you’re looking to build a consistently successful, opt-in, organic marketing stream that will beyond a shadow-of-a-doubt make your business more money and drive a ton more revenue I’ve got a secret for you.So let’s get started.The benefits of building a mob are absolutely vast, reaching far beyond the likes of simple “growth hacks” but to a level of cult-following that will propel any business forward, in any field.Building a community, a real, engaging and influential community will give you many things that a simple “growth hack” cannot.You want a community because you want advocates. It’s as simple as this, There is a core voice for every business, there is a core audience for every business, sometimes the two don’t meet. Focusing on aligning these two will be what makes or breaks your success in creating a thriving community.If you don’t focus on aligning your message with your actual core audience, you will be throwing content in the dark. So here are some steps to takeNow these may seem ambiguous, or vague, so let me elaborate and give you some steps.Have a home-base for your content, this should (in most cases) be a blog, but obviously different companies have different unique opportunities within their space. Gain inspiration from competitors, or other businesses in your space, sometimes it’s easiest to see what other people are doing with their core solution, and adapt it to your core principles.This was Steve Jobs speaking directly to his mob, from his heart, because his mob was wrapped around his vision of the world. Steve established Apple’s mob and polarized it with this statement, which is why it became his most well-known quote of all-time. This is the most influential marketing Steve ever did, not the secrecy of his product launches, not his decisions against the competition, this quote was the defining moment of his marketing excellence. This is where the mob was defined, this is where the rebels found their home.Are you still looking for a “growth-hack” to take your business to the next level?Or are you now looking to build a mob, a group of people unified under one common interest, an emotion, a need, a passion. Are you looking for your audience? The one that will push you, accelerate you, empower you, back you, love you? Are you ready to engage, to build, to unleash your group, your core “tribe” and dominate your market with the personality and vision unique to you and your company?This is what every startup needs, you need a mob, you need the pitchforks and fiery brooms, you need the chanting, the advocates, the lovers, the fighters, they are your source, your backbone, without it you won’t last in this new age of marketing, without it you won’t have a “growth hack” to save you, you will be lost in the ether, while another mob takes your lunch.Co-founder  Consultant Short, quickly digestible, thought provoking reads for the coffee break.

Less than six months ago we launched our journalism startup They make us register at every newspaper or magazine we want to read. They make us pay monthly fees for entire websites, while there’s all kinds of stuff on there we don’t actually read. And we have to visit all kinds of different websites to discover the journalism from print newspapers and magazines we like.Great journalism deserves a great reading experience. Because of Blendle, the friendly people of The Netherlands can flip through all print newspapers and magazines in their country for free. Only when they actually read an article, they have to pay for that single article. And if they don’t like it, they can instantly refund their money.Blendle is great for discovering fantastic journalism. Users can see what articles their friends or interesting curators (celebrities, journalists, politicians, radio DJ’s) have shared from the paid sections of today’s newspapers and magazines, and which articles are trending on the site.Users can also follow subjects (for example bitcoins, or ebola) and journalists. Whenever a new article gets published, they receive an email.We built Blendle with love for great journalism. It’s a new way for the next generation to discover and read the best articles from newspapers and magazines. With the best user experience possible for journalism.Blendle currently has more than 130,000 users in The Netherlands. And those users are young — very young for an app that focusses on quality journalism. 60% of our users are between 20 and 35 years of age. The 20 to 25 age group is the biggest group on our site. Blendle is currently only available in The Netherlands. But, our backing by The New York Times and Axel Springer enables us to launch Blendle in other countries soon.My co-founder (27) and I (27) are both journalists. I’ve been a technology columnist for a Dutch newspaper and Marten wrote a book and was editor at a newspaper with huge circulation. We saw the decline of journalism in The Netherlands first hand. We saw the huge personnel cuts. The struggle with digital publishing. And declining advertising income. Older journalists were telling us all the time that only a couple of years ago they could proudly tell advertisers that that day’s newspaper was completely full—no space for ads anymore that day. The sales guys wouldn’t answer the continuously ringing phone anymore.Earlier this month former Washington Post editor Robert G. Kaiser wrote This graph out of his essay is pretty scary for newspaper companies:And it gets even scarier when then you take a look at this one:The same dire situation applies to the circulation of newspapers:The next years are not going to be any easier for print publishers.The In the last couple of months, my co-founder and I lived through quite a number of milestones with Blendle. It was really exciting when we signed our first newspaper NRC Handelsblad to have their content appear in Blendle. It was exciting when we signed our first employee. When an article appeared in the Financial Times about what we’re doing. And in The Guardian. And in The Economist. When suddenly, we got a link to a Youtube-video of CNN Chile, where they were talking about our product for 20 minutes in a language we don’t understand. When Vodafone suddenly created TV commercials about us. When a tour bus with 30 editors-in-chief from Finland visited our small office, and they all started taking pictures of the place with their phones. (That was kind of weird actually).Today is the biggest milestone of them all. We are truly honored that two of the world’s most influential publishers show so much trust in us. Axel Springer has successfully transformed its business into a digital publishing house with Bild.de and the soon-to-launch European version of Politico.com. And the online strategy of The New York Times serves as a worldwide example for other newspapers and magazines. We believe we can learn a lot from these companies.I’ll let Co-founder of BlendleUpdates on our journalism startup

We talk to lots of founders who underestimate how hard it is to make money selling consumer hardware, especially on their first production run. If your product costs $30 to produce and you sell it for $99, you make money, right?Not so fast.To illustrate this, let’s manufacture a Most companies spend lots of time and money in product development. Simple products cost $100k–500k to develop and usually take around 6–9 months. More complex products can cost millions and take years.To get our Bolt-o-Phones ready for manufacturing, we need to hire a mechanical and electrical engineer, an industrial designer, and an operations person. They spend 9 months talking to users, building prototypes and getting ready to manufacture the product. Our costs look something like this:With product development finished we’ll have a final list of parts used to make our headphones (called a Bill of Materials or BOM for short). This is the most fundamental cost structure we have to deal with as a hardware company. We can’t raise money from investors or launch a crowdfunding campaign until we have a good understanding of BOM cost.The BOM includes plastic parts we need molded, printed circuit board/components to buy, glue to assemble the plastics, and the packaging the Bolt-o-Phones come in. Each part is laid out in a table with all the information necessary to make one pair of Bolt-o-Phones: part number, quantity per unit, vendor, lead times, costs, and various notes.The BOM leaves out some critical costs associated with each unit. Each pair of Bolt-o-Phones takes time for workers in China to assemble. We also have to ship the product around the world. These costs (and others) are reflected in the Cost of Goods Sold (commonly known as COGS). Financially, COGS are calculated using inventory cost, but for startups it’s easier to think of COGS as just an ‘extended BOM’. Here I include anything that we pay for on a per unit basis that we can’t order more of but is required to get the product out the door (like duties, scrap rates, and return rates calculated as a percentage of the BOM cost):We also have fixed costs associated with our first production run. When the company is still young with relatively small amounts of cash, these fixed costs make a significant impact to our financials. Fixed costs are things we pay for once per design, like tooling for plastic parts, FCC fees for bluetooth radio certification, UL/CE product certification costs, or value-added services from the CM. These fixed costs are good to outline separately (as they can be large expenses) but it’s also helpful to show the amortized cost over the production run of 5,000 units, which is what I’ve done here:After 9 months of development, manufacturing and logistics, we wind up with 5,000 units of our product sitting in a warehouse in the US. We’ve spent around $690k ($360k for development and $330k for manufacturing) to get here and are ready to begin sending customers their gorgeous Bolt-o-Phones.Originally, a BOM cost of $32.16 would lead us to believe we can make money selling the product for $99 anywhere we want. But once all the other expenses are factored into the fully-loaded cost, it starts to narrow down our distribution options. The three typical distribution options any company has are:Our profit on each unit varies hugely depending on which channel we sell into:Notice that each unit sold in physical retail actually LOSES money. This is why it’s very difficult for a small company with a limited amount of cash in the bank to go straight to retail distribution with their first production run.A 5,000 unit production run can seem pretty daunting for first-time founders, but it’s peanuts relative to successful consumer products. Real success comes from selling lots of units, mainly due to massive economies of scale. At high volumes:The Bolt-o-Phones fully-loaded unit cost will dramatically change as the number of units we manufacture increases. Notice how most costs decrease significantly except marketing, which tend to increase over time:The profitability of the company also drastically changes, driven by increased leverage from margin negotiations and lower unit cost:Although it’s an amazing accomplishment to ship 5,000 units of anything, this table illustrates just how difficult it is to make money in the early days of a hardware business. Even the most successful crowdfunding campaigns (Canary, Pebble, Oculus, Ouya, etc) struggle to make money on their first production run. It takes massive manufacturing scale like Fitbit (with 10.9 million units sold in 2014) to build a venture-scale, profitable business (currently worth around $9B). But don’t be discouraged! Selling 10.9M units seemed like a pipe dream to James and Eric when they started Fitbit in 2007.Venture Capital Designed for Hardware. More at Venture Capital Designed for Hardware

Titles shouldn’t matter, but unfortunately everyone has to have one — including me. Today, I am the COO at Mattermark. The only consensus on what a COO does is that there is no consensus, especially at startups (see articles at the bottom). The role varies from company to company, some don’t have the role, and the jury is out on whether startups need one.I believe the job of a founding COO is to do the most important things the company hasn’t hired for yet, hire or delegate to someone in your place, and move on. Founding COOs need to be zero-to-one people who are good at and comfortable with firing themselves.I wasn’t always the COO. Mattermark is the same legal entity as Referly, but as Danielle says, “I remember the lunch where Danielle told me she and Kevin had decided to shut down Referly, and I wasn’t totally sure I had a place in their post-Referly company. Danielle explained to me that they had no idea what they would do next, but that I was welcome to join them and continue going on missions. So that’s what I did, and it’s not that different from what I do now.When we started Mattermark, Danielle blogged a ton and talked to potential investors, I hand-gathered a boatload of data, and Kevin helped me turn my process into software. We were a blogger, a guy In the early days we got our data by hand. We had an advantage over incumbents and later up-and-comers because we were willing to do work that didn’t scale to deliver value for our customers.So the first team we built at Mattermark was a team of data analysts who filled a forest of spreadsheets with data on companies in VC firm portfolios. I led this team in my first functional owner role, and we decided to change my title to “Head of Research  Data.” As we built repeatable processes to get certain data points — we call it the “human algorithm — we realized I had taken the team from 0–1. It was time to hire a much more qualified Head of Data.In January 2014, we had just tried to raise our Series A, and got feedback that we needed to prove out some other customer segments. Our sales were entirely inbound at the time, and we were getting a lot of non-VC customers signing up from investment bankers to salespeople to real estate brokers. I set out to (1) increase revenue and (2) determine whether we were actually ready to sell to any of these other segments.I was good at this mission, but I didn’t want to do eight demos a day and carry a quota forever. This was hard both for me and the company. By firing myself from sales, I was essentially firing one of our most productive sales reps.Early on in my second mission, at one of our company all-hands meetings, I remember when one of our engineers asked, “Andy, I know you’re working really hard, but what is it that you do?” We all laughed, and I explained the things I had been working on.I felt like an My third mission was less well defined because, well, it was about five missions at once. This fall, we needed to get a new office, figure out recruiting, start a customer support  success team, and turn our startup into a professionally managed company (see legal, accounting, HR, and all the fun stuff). At this time, I had the choice to go with “VP of Facilities, Recruiting, Customer Support  Success, Finance,  HR,” or something more catch-all like COO. One of our investors offered a third option, “VP of Shit.” I decided to go with COO.In 2015, we hired an outstanding Customer Success Manager, Manali Karmarkar. That team is running like greased lightning now. We moved away from a centralized recruiting function with internal recruiters to a model that distributes the load amongst hiring managers. Finally, we hired a VP of Finance, Emad Khan, to take over finance, HR, and facilities.Keith Rabois says “you’re constantly fixing things,” which you are. You are also constantly solving problems you haven’t solved before. Problem solving in an ambiguous environment should be a founding COO’s core skill.Going forward, my job will be the same as it’s always been: find the most important things the company hasn’t hired for yet, hire or delegate to someone in my place, and move on.Co-Founder  COO 

(This essay first appeared on I was asked this once by an entrepreneur via a I asked this entrepreneur how’s he doing with retention. Are his users coming back to his app?To my horror, I find out that none of his users are coming back. They sign up. Then, they disappear.I told him straight up, “bro, you’re crazy for thinking about growth hacking right now. Growth hacking could kill your startup.”That sounds like a contradiction. How can For most startups the root cause of growth challenges is a product/market fit (PMF) issue. Growth hacking requires a solid foundation of PMF. Sean Ellis, the guy who coined the phrase “growth hacking”, agrees in In my opinion, focusing on “growth hacking” before PMF is stupid and dangerous. You’re wasting your limited money, time and energy trying to growth hack a product instead of building a product that’s worthy to be growth hacked. You’re not ready to drive sustainable growth if you are trying to sell the wrong product or sell in the wrong market. If you are obsessed about scaling growth in this situation, you will likely kill your startup.That’s why at the early stage of a startup, instead of trying to market any shitty product, focus on building a product that is easy to market. Figure out who your early adopters are, what their needs are and building a product that will blow their mind. The best marketing decision you can make is to have a product or business that fulfills a real and compelling need for a real and defined group of people — no matter how much tweaking and refining this takes.Ryan Holiday, author best-selling book “Growth Hacker Marketing: A Primer on the Future of PR, Marketing and Advertising”, agrees in So if your users are not coming back to your mobile or web app, stop growth hacking. If you can’t even retain users, there is no point in growing the top of the funnel. Period.PMF is a fairly abstract concept making it difficult to know when you have actually achieved it. As Sean Ellis mentioned in From what Paul, Steve and Marc said, you need to look at the different stages of the startup. In general, a startup goes through three phases of growing:The goals, metrics, channels, optimization, focus and tools changes and evolves as you move through these three phases. Knowing where you are in this path helps you understand what you should be spending your time and money on. Focusing on the right tactics at the right time helps you move through the startup growth phases efficiently and successfully.I’m going to make some generalizations to help you understand the differences of each phase. But understand that this can vary depending on your type of business.Here’s a summary of the goals, metrics, channels, focus and tools for each of the three phases. Note that the following is inspired by Note that at this stage, your cost per acquisition (CPA) will likely be greater than the long-term value (LTV) of your customers. As Paul Graham said, Most large companies get 80% of their initial userbase from one channel: LinkedIn via variality (email), Hubspot via content marketing, Trip Advisor via search, Zynga via Facebook.At this stage, your CPA should be getting closer to your LTV. You should have enough data to calculate your LTV at this point.Time to scale, baby! Turn on the boosters.When I was in business school at As my classmates and I sat down after our lunch break, he asked what the first law of holes was. We all looked at each other dumbfounded. What is the first law of holes?The first law of holes refers to a proverb “if you find yourself in a hole, stop digging”. The meaning behind it is that if you find yourself in an indefensible position, you should stop and change, rather than carry on exacerbating it.The same is true with startups. If you’re not getting traction or seeing the results you want, growth hacking will not help you. In fact, it could suck your valuable and limited resources and end up killing your startup.If you haven’t achieved PMF and you get the urge to growth hack, remember the first law of holes. Stop digging and change. Change your customer, problem or solution until you get to product/market fit.—Want more detailed and in-depth guides on growth? —P.S.

Ali, and I We stayed on board after the acquisition for 8 months. During that time, it became apparent to us that due to internal issues at our new parent company, we were not going to be able to hit our earn out metrics. Due to confidentiality issues, I can’t say much more here, but the situation sucked. We had delivered on everything we had promised and yet we were going to not hit the earn out metrics. Ali and I got disheartened and decided to leave to start a new company. After all, we’re entrepreneurs at heart and when you can’t control the situation, its best to walk away.We decided to start a peer to peer service for high end cars. Think getaround.com / relayrides.com but for nicer, more aspirational cars. We called it HIGEAR.com. Ali has always loved sports cars, but owning one is just downright impractical. So we thought, here is a great service that allows anyone to have access to greatest inventory of sports and luxury cars without the trouble of actually owning one. People would line up by the hundreds to use this. And in a way they actually did!Given we had just sold Peanut Labs, fund raising turned out to be quite straightforward. While raising money for Peanut Labs, I literally pitched and got turned down by 32 VCs. That equates to over 100 actual meetings on Sand Hill road. This time around, we did maybe a dozen meetings and in 3 weeks raised $1.3M at very decent terms. We ended up raising money from eVentures, Battery Ventures, 500 Startups and about 8 angels. With $1.3M in the bank, we were set to hit the pedal hard.At this point, most people would have said, hold on! Go on a vacation. Get some rest before starting your next company. I did not feel tired or exhausted. In fact, being small and nimble again, I was energized and full of excitement. Success solves a lot of problems, including energy, and we were off to a great start.We spent 3 months building a working V1 of the website and launched it August 2011. Had a phenomenal launch party, We spent a lot of time and energy developing the brand. We had a hi-fi website, lots of pretty professionally done photo shoots. Models, sexy cars, apparel. You name it and we probably did it. And we did this all this in an extremely short amount of time (5 months total). We were very lucky to have some extremely talented people work with us. Dan Geily as CTO, Nabeel Khan, lead developer, and Sigouy Mo as our lead designer.3 months after launch, due to our aggressive marketing we were doing $60k/ net revenue month. At the time, that was more revenue than either of the other peer to peer car sharing guys were going. They had both raised $10M+, had been in business for 1-2 years each and had much bigger teams than us.But during this time, Ali and I both were getting pretty uneasy about the fundamental business model. We had an incident where The elephant in the room was the shitty business model. We kept 30% and the owner was paid 70%. After we accounted for insurance, incidentals, user acquisition costs, we were running a negative margin business. Now in startup land, the VCs encourage this kind of practice. Its OK to lose money, and everyone thinks you’ll make it up in volume / repeat biz. That rarely ever happens. You can’t escape basic unit economics. And we felt the entire P2P car sharing space, had extremely bad unit economics. So after 3 months of having an incredible run, we decided to pull the plug. Shut down the service because we did not feel we could ever turn around the negative unit economics.Interestingly enough, during this process, Ali and I became friends with the founders of other car-sharing services, like GetAround, Wheelz,  Relayrides. We actually told all of them why this model sucks, and they need to pivot ASAP to keep their companies alive. I think once you’ve raised $10-20M, its very hard to back to your investors and say My only regret from HIGEAR is I should have had the insight (aka. balls) to do ride sharing (Uber, Lyft etc). We considered the model, but thought, So it was now April 2012. We had $750k in the bank (of the $1.3M raised). A a completely blank slate. So began the craziest, most creative,  and downright painful period of my startup career.I thought as you do more, it gets easier. In a way it does — you have a lot more insight and hopefully don’t repeat the same mistakes twice. People return your emails more often, its easier to raise money etc. But here is the part that doesn’t get easier. And you’re not going to have a successful company without this bit, no matter how good you are at recruiting / raising capital / selling.Product market fit is sort of like finding love. You don’t find it, it finds you. You just have to keep working hard, and hope you’re ready when it does find you. And its not absolute — you can have a product market fit for a product that will scale to $1M in revenue, and not beyond. Its truly difficult to find product market fit for some thing that will scale to $100M+ in revenue. And the problem with being a repeat entrepreneur is, $1M just isn’t exciting anymore (such ungrateful brats we are!). Its not black or white — its freaking 50 shades of gray.Part of what helped us do such rapid iterations and so many experiments, is Ali and I learned to design and code. All of the products we did post Higear, either Ali or myself did the front end development for. Nabeel  Salman, being the super stars they are, did all the backend. So in total most of these experiments were run by a total team of 4. In general i’ve found, smaller the team, the more you get done.The jury is still out on what works, whether we’ve done the right things, and how this all turns out. Think of this as a mid way report. I’m sure when I look back after this is all done, the line to success or failure will seem straight and direct. But right now, while we’re still figuring things out, its quite jumbled and messy. The path an electron takes to get from A to B — to us it seems like a straight line, but in (quantum) reality its passed through every possible path, and then arrived at point B.Builder of things and ideas.

Imagine if someone asked “would you invest in this company?” Your answer is going to be similar. With a few additions.Here’s the checklist I would follow:This is not always reliable (Mark Zuckerberg or Larry Page hadn’t built businesses before) but there’s an interesting stat:85% of startups fail. If the CEO has built and sold a startup before then the odds go down to 25%. So you might as well have the statistics on your side.By good funding I mean two things:And, by the way, this is an important thing to note: if the company has six months or less worth of funding THEN THEY ARE ALREADY OUT OF BUSINESS. Which is why “A” above is so important. Good CEOs know this.And, I’ll throw in a bonus third thing on this: it shows they are the type of company / CEO who can raise money, sell his vision, etc.This can mean several things.I’ll give a good example and a bad example.Good example: Tesla. You would work for Tesla if you believe in Elon Musk’s vision of reduced need on fossil fuels, or if you want to drive a Tesla, or if you think if everyone driving an electronic car (and having a powerwall) will help a million or more people.Bad example: someone pitched me an idea where consumers can pick the type of ads they see. I do NOT see how this would really help a million or more people. So I would not work for a company like that (and, by the way, they had a lot of investors).I invested in a startup recently that developed a technology for vaping vitamins and medical drugs. I USE the product (I vape B12 with it, Vitamin D with it, and trans-reservatrol). And I can easily see how this can help a million or more people (the entire US is Vitamin D deficient and people’s bodies are unable to digest vitamin pills. (Btw, not trying to get anyone interested in this — already fully funded).You’re presumably getting options at a startup and, depending on the value you contribute, those options will increase.How do you know if their latest round valuation is good?Forget for a second the money they raised (we dealt with that above).But imagine you had, in cash, the amount of their full valuation. Would you be able to create a better product with more traction? Like, for $46 billion, would you be able to beat Uber? Unclear to me. But there are plenty of startups out there where if you gave me their full valuation in cash I can easily see how they can be replaced.Don’t work for a company that is easily replaceable at a lower valuation.#2 consideration. If you believe in the valuation, make sure your options are not at the venture capital price but at the “409A valuation” price. Google that.There’s a great story about Sergey Brin interviewing people. He can usually tell in the first few minutes if he’s not going to hire someone.So then he spends the rest of the interview making sure he learns at least one thing from the interviewee.Make sure that even in the worst case scenario where you misjudged everything else, that you at least learn one thing fairly quickly after you take the job so that it adds to your skillset and you can move on to get a better job.I took a job once at HBO (not a startup but still) where I learned so much in a three year period I was able to take the skills (ranging from technology to entertainment to TV production) that I was able to leave and start a successful company.I visit a lot of companies per year for various reasons. I always look for the subtleties.The entire culture of a company comes from the top down. So if the partners who started the business don’t have their emotional act together, the company itself won’t be emotionally sound.Read the biography of the founder of JetBlue. He would stay up to 3 in the morning every night responding to customer service emails.Once a month he would ride on one of the longer plane rides and starting at the back of the plane and moving to the front he would sit with every passenger and ask them if they had any problems with the flight. He actually hired employees that way.That’s the CEO but everyone in the company should have that attitude towards customers. A year ago I visited a law firm where they were trashing their customers and making jokes about it. That’s not the sort of company I would hire, work for, invest in, etc.A company and it’s customers are ONE eco-system. Not “us vs them”.A lot of bosses make hiring decisions based on “would you ride in a cross-country airplane next to this guy”.You should make your decision the same way about your potential bosses. Believe me — they need you more than you need them. So you have to like them.Also, think ecosystem again — try to see their relationships with other people in the company. All gossiping is bad. Hopefully they think highly of the people they work with. Else you shouldn’t work for them and you shouldn’t work for that company.Warren Buffett is not a value investor. Everyone thinks he is but he hasn’t done real value investing since the early 1960s.Warren Buffett is a demographic investor. Two quotes from Buffett:“If a company is going to be here 20 years from now then it is probably a good stock to buy”.and“If you have a strong demographic wind behind you then the company will do well even with poor management”.Example: the book, “Bold” lists a lot of demographic trends that take advantage of Moore’s Law that are getting bigger. Robotics, Internet of Things, 3D Printing, etc. That’s one start. Another start are companies disrupting healthcare since that is such a mess right now.Another example: I’d rather work for Uber than a company that lends money against taxi medallions. I’d rather work for AirBnB than Marriott.I’d rather work for Tesla than GM.You can’t ask in your interview, “when will you IPO?”It’s unpredictable when a company will “exit” (i.e. get sold or IPO or have some event which allows employees to sell some of their shares).A good company might wait 7–10 years before an exit. In fact, a good company SHOULD wait 7–10 years.How come? Because if they are good then they are undoubtedly growing faster than the market. So they should stay private as long as possible to maximize benefits for shareholders / employees.Here’s the problem. The average employee stays at a startup for 3.1 years (perhaps that corresponds to vesting schedules, I don’t know).Make sure you can wait for that 7–10 year run. Also, I’d try to figure out if management is ultimately interested in an exit. Some CEOs are not.Make sure you see the path to profitability. Some startups might be years away.But the good thing about working for a company that ultimately has huge margins (not just profits but margins) is that they have a lot of perks.Just compare the chef at Google with the chef at Walmart. Hint: there IS NO chef at Walmart.This seems like a big checklist before you decide to work for a startup. But don’t forget that YOU are the valuable person here.Take care of all of your needs and then you will have more freedom, be able to demonstrate greater competence at your job, and have better relationships with the people you work with.In other words, you’ll be happy.And that’s a nice reason to take a job.For some reason, Ive turned myself inside out and all my guts have spilled onto my blog.

What is it like to be a female in tech?I think the industry is really curious about this topic — almost so much so that we appear committed to proving how different (or perhaps difficult) it is to be a female CEO.If a reporter asks me why it sucks to be a female CEO, I can come up with hundreds of reasons. On the other hand, if I am asked to argue why it’s awesome to be a female CEO, I can also do that pretty well. So here is my take on both sides.And the sad news is, this is one of the more professional emails.2. Fundraising 3. You might be able to hire more talented female employees.

“Hey, Ryan! I have an awesome startup idea to disrupt LEGO’s! It’s called Mego.”“Tell me about it, Steve.” I respond.“Ok, say you want to build your house, dog, or anything really, out of LEGO’s. With Mego, you simply launch the mobile app, snap a few pics, upload them, and we mail you a custom blueprint and Mego pieces to assemble your creation!” Steve rattled in a single breath.“Interesting. So what excites you about toys and Mego?” I questioned.“Uh, well, I loved LEGO’s as a kid and think this would be really cool.”I further prompted, “Do you have experience or connections in toy manufacturing? Any idea of the level of marketing required and the economic feasibility to make this a success?”“No and no. I haven’t looked into that yet. I just put up a landing page to measure interest and started looking for a developer,” Steve responded with decreasing enthusiasm.We’ve all fallen into this trap. We come up with a new startup idea, get excited, and immediately start running experiments to Before jumping into your next startup idea, ask yourself:Despite the number of perceived overnight successes, reinforced by demo days and TechCrunch launches, startups are anything but. It takes several years of building and marketing to create a successful business. During this time, entrepreneurs face inevitable struggles that, I’ve made this mistake myself. Nearly a year ago, I had the idea to create “Uber for laundry”. In San Francisco, a washer and dryer is a luxury that most cannot afford. I named it Laundry Mate, a mobile app for on-demand laundry service. I built a landing page for my fake app to measure demand and collect email addresses. And then I took a step back and asked myself, “Do I really want to be in the laundry business?” The answer, if you couldn’t guess, was “no”.Passion can come from many places. For some, it is a feverish desire to solve their own problem. Some get excited about a particular market. Others are simply passionate about building a business and making money. Whatever your passion, be prudent and introspect your true motivations.I fully support ambitious entrepreneurs but sometimes ambition and excitement blinds them from reality. We’re not all Elon Musk and must honestly evaluate our ability to execute on the idea.I’ve spoken to several people that underestimate the level of effort, capital, or marketing required to make their idea a success. “It’ll go viral!” is never the right assumption.A friend of mine once pitched an idea for a social, restaurant discovery app. The concept was similar to Yelp but with more emphasis on recommendations from friends. Let’s assume people want a more social Yelp. Even if that were true, the product must achieve massive user growth to become a successful business. Not to mention, it would be in direct competition with Yelp, Foursquare, and other incumbents in this crowded space. Some entrepreneurs have the experience and capital to pull this off. Not my friend.I’m not advocating entrepreneurs to never Before jumping into your next startup idea, evaluate the pre-requisite P’s. Am I truly passionate about this? Is this pragmatically achievable considering my skill-set, capital, and market conditions?If you answer “no” to either question, reconsider the idea. You have many ideas.

I’m writing this from One reason I’m building a startup is to gain control over many aspects of my life. I like to hack my productivity, and I’ve found I don’t enjoy normal working hours or offices. If you’re working on a startup or have aspirations to create one, I’m guessing you can relate. By experimenting with these concepts, I’ve found I can get more done.I find it particularly interesting to relate this to startups because there’s a lot of emphasis on crazy things like 18-hour days in startups.Over the last year, I’ve realised that whilst time is limited and in some ways determines how much I can get done, what really determines my productivity is what I do and how I feel in the time I have. Energy plays a large factor in how we feel and how productive we are. I realised how important energy is in a book I read a short while ago called In a similar way to the fact that you need renewal in order to grow muscles, we also need renewal in order to grow our capacity of mental energy. Here is how Loehr and Schwarz put it:This idea that if we shift from trying to manage time to managing our energy we can achieve more and feel better while we do it has lead to me doing quite a lot of experiments with my work and rest.I’ve tried many techniques to squeeze maximum productivity out of myself. When I embarked upon my first venture I was working very long hours, far beyond the point where my productivity dipped. This was a habit I carried over from university as a result of deadlines imposed at university.One of my weaknesses is that I over-estimate how much I can get done in a period of time, so it is easy for me to go far beyond my optimal levels of energy. I came across a comment in an article on A The suggested way to improve our ability to “fully disengage” is by creating rituals. I have a ritual in the evening of going for a short walk and upon returning going straight to bed and reading a fiction book. It helps me disengage from the work I’ve done in the day and get the sleep I need to wake up refreshed and ready for the next exciting day.Being here in Javea is fantastic because I can experiment with spending a little less time working and intersperse the work with going to the beach, playing some table tennis or taking a swim. Many find it odd that I would do any work at all from here, but I’ve realised over time that I feel the best when I have a balance of work and rest.Have you thought about how your energy levels affect your productivity? Do you experiment with work and rest? I’d love to hear your thoughts.Photo credit: Founder/CEO  at 

On ne peut plus laisser passer ce genre d’article : Si nous n’avons pas de Google français, ce n’est pas à cause d’une fiscalité ou d’une soit disant rigidité du marché du travail, mais à cause de ce genre de discours qui châtre une génération d’entrepreneur français et avec elle l’avenir industriel du pays. Accélérer l’écosystème entrepreneurial français passe aussi par anéantir ce qui lui nuit.L’article commence avec la définition la plus grossière trouvée sur les startups :Il y a une et une seule définition d’une startup, celle de Steve Blank : “Une startup doit être à la recherche d’un business model scalable. Donc les exemples cités pour illustrer “cet esprit startup” ne sont PAS des startups. Où est la scalabilité de Fabernovel ou de Michel et Augustin ? Il n’y en pas. Ce sont des PMEs, pas des startups.

Attention, il n’y a rien de péjoratif à être une PME d’autant plus si elle est innovante ...Contrairement à ce qu’affirme cet article, une startup n’est une pas une boîte entre 0 et 7 ans.

I’m currently 29 weeks pregnant with our It wasn’t until after my first pregnancy that I realized how unusual it is to meet other pregnant women or women with small children working at startups. My hypothesis is that many women opt-out of startups because they assume the benefits will be terrible — I’ve heard people say things like In both my pregnancies, I have had coworkers tell me that I am the first person they really knew who was pregnant. You sometimes see pregnant women on the bus or on the street, but it’s very likely that someone in their mid-20s has just never known anyone pregnant, much less someone they see almost everyday.This time around, I’m grateful to have the company of two other women at Medium who are pregnant at the same time. Our private slack channel is a caricature of pregnant women’s food cravings, but also more seriously, a wonderful support resource. The many parents at Medium also have a #parents channel which is fantastic for swapping/borrowing kid gear or hand-me-downs and asking for advice.When I was pregnant with my daughter, Medium (then Obvious) was a wee recently-launched startup of about twenty employees. There was no parental leave policy in place yet. Fortunately (though I wasn’t too worried) Medium adopted a very generous maternity policy very similar to Google’s, which was unheard of for a startup of its size. Currently, the maternity leave policy is 18 weeks fully paid (or 20 if you deliver via C-section).The first trimester was the most difficult for me both times. I had horrible nausea with 2–4x a day vomiting for 6–8 weeks in both pregnancies. At work, I was mostly exhausted, and trying to keep up my productivity, while hoping that my grumpiness and lowered output weren’t too obvious. No one gives you their seat on Bart or Caltrain because you’re not visibly pregnant. As a software engineer, I’m fortunate that I can find a quiet spot in the office, elevate my legs, and code on my laptop for most of the day. The worst part during my first pregnancy was walking to and from the office from Caltrain. The fumes from the cars and buses made my nausea worse, and I had to dodge smokers.My first pregnancy, I sometimes found it difficult to focus either due to sheer exhaustion or “pregnancy brain” from all the hormonal changes. Note-taking while coding and to-do lists helped out a lot so I could refocus quickly if I forgot something. In both pregnancies, after the first trimester, I was able to take on large projects and operate at normal levels throughout.I was pregnant when we first launched Medium back in 2012, and I remember Ev giving a talk to the team where he said something to the effect of, Launching a product to the world is like having a baby — you thought that the pregnancy was Pregnant women always get the advice to enjoy your time and sleep before the baby comes. After the baby comes, it’s not just about you anymore. If you end up breastfeeding, you become the sole food source for an entire human. For a few weeks, that’s your sole responsibility. In a strange way, it’s relaxing (despite the sleep deprivation and exhaustion) to not feel pressure to be productive in other ways.Random people also feel super enthusiastic about telling you how they feel about your decisions. When Alina was about a year old, a family friend I had never met asked me who was taking care of her while I was at work. “Oh she’s been in daycare for over 6 months now,” I replied. “But…she’s so young!” she replied with the most pitying look. Other parents (though let’s be honest, probably me too) can also be super judgmental, but my husband and I treated this whole experience pretty scientifically. We tried to communicate openly about what was working in splitting up work and childcare, and what wasn’t, and we made small incremental tweaks all the time (i.e. how to split up house chores, strategies for sleep training).After Alina was born, I chose to come back part-time (M-W) after ~7 weeks. We had gotten into a pretty good sleep routine, I had started watching Stanford iOS development courses, and was itching to get back to work. In all honesty, despite the generous leave policy and the good intentions of everyone I worked with, coming back to work after my first pregnancy was rough. In that short time, we had had a hiring spurt, and the engineering team had grown by about 50%. On my third day back at work, we also had 8 summer interns starting. It was chaos, and juggling a schedule where I could devote time to coding, reintegrate with the now-vastly-different team, and pump milk for my newborn was incredibly challenging.When I returned to work, with our small team and open floor plan, there weren’t any private conference rooms to pump in, so we got a bit creative and I set up a permanent station in the spacious handicap bathroom stall with a comfy chair and side table. This was far from ideal, but not as horrific as what you think of when people talk about pumping in bathrooms, and it worked out. The current office, designed for our growing team, includes a very nice mother’s room complete with sink, mini fridge, and hospital-grade pump.I’ve I’ve also connected with several other moms or moms-to-be in the startup world. Although I don’t have a close group of neighborhood mom friends (I’m an introvert, ok?), I do feel a close connection to these other women who are making it work for them. We have many shared experiences of attending conferences while pumping for our babies, of going to work while horribly nauseous, and of losing clumps of hair post-partum. Baby showers, stroller walks, and playdates are the new Burning Man, skydiving, and scotch tastings, or something.I like deleting code and shaving yaks at A pop-up conversation about having a job. And kids. At the same time.

I spent last Saturday giving design feedback to the current batch of startups at 500 Startups HQ in Mountain View, California. For each company, I’d quickly listen to their value proposition, look through their product, and provide suggestions for improvement over the course of fifteen minutes. At the end of the day, a recurring theme had emerged — many founders didn’t know their product’s story. The companies were all very early stage, so it’s not particularly troubling, but “before you design anything, you first need to be able to tell your story” (It’s common for entrepreneurs to pitch their products as a list of features, tech specs, or explain an abstract, convoluted idea. What they should do instead is a story — something everyone can understand and relate to, from investors and employees to friends and family. Something that is memorable, easily passed around, and well-received by even the least tech-savvy. The web’s most viral products are the result of simplicity that represents something commonly understood. Instagram’s founder, Kevin Systrom, started out with a full-fledged mobile social network called Brbn, but whittled the product down to a single feature — capturing beautiful moments and sharing them with others. To craft a story, you must first understand the problem you’re trying to solve, and your solution — inside and out, backwards and forwards.There are three types of problems entrepreneurs aim to solve with a product: a problem you have yourself, a problem someone else has, or a problem that doesn’t exist. It’s easier to solve a problem you face than someone else’s, and most difficult to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. I’ve found that it’s common for entrepreneurs to list out multiple problems they’re trying to solve at once, explain what their customers want when they had never spoken to them, or have difficulty clearly articulating the pain point their product solves. This convolution is often reflected in their homepage messaging and product flow. Every This was a problem that would only grow as we took more and more photos with our mobile phones, and Kevin knew it was worth focusing on. Brbn never took off, even though it had filters because the product was trying to solve a much broader issue. When understanding the problem it’s best to talk with your target demographic as much as possible before you begin to hypothesize a solution. This helps discourage any bias, validate that it’s a real issue, and identify one problem that you can focus on.It’s easy for an engineer or designer to come up with an idea in the shower, and later that night start building away. It’s our natural state to build, but what will likely happen is that you’ll build something only you understand as feature creep sets in and you spend weeks polishing your product. Instead of building right away, take a step back and make sure you understand what you’re going to work on. Hopefully you’ve identified a single problem, so it’s easier to focus on creating a single solution that does one thing very well. One of the startups I talked to on Saturday said his product had multiple types of customers, and that the user homepage had to accommodate each of their needs. Creating a product that provides many solutions is difficult to build, and it’s best to start with a solution that’s as simple as possible. Here’s how Instagram They’ve added additional features since then, but this was, and still is, their most unique and compelling feature.The story is the summation of the problem you’ve identified, and the solution you’re proposing. It’s devoid of technical back-end, industry buzzwords, and feature lists. It’s the entirety of what your product represents and why it exists expressed in concepts and laymen terms that you could explain to an aunt or uncle at a family reunion. Begin with by describing The second part is to describe Crafting a narrative to describe your product should be the first step, prior to building, and can be used throughout the entire process. It provides a starting point for storyboarding the design, mocking up the flow, writing the homepage messaging, and marketing the product. It also ensures everyone involved is building the same thing and working towards the same goal.In the next article, I’ll explain how you can take your product’s story and build something that is easily understood, marketable, and measurable.

I’ve spent this year working with corporations and government agencies that are adopting and adapting One of the interesting innovation challenges I’ve encountered centers on a company’s culture. While startups have the luxury of building values and culture from scratch, existing companies that want to (re)start corporate innovation must reboot an existing –and at times deeply rooted- corporate culture. It’s not an easy task, but failing to change the culture will doom any innovation efforts the company attempts.All too often a corporate innovation initiative starts and ends with a board meeting mandate to the CEO followed by a series of memos to the staff, with lots of posters, and one-day workshops. This typically creates “innovation theater” but very little innovation.Two McKinsey consultants, Terry Deal and Arthur Kennedy wrote a book called By the time I joined, the company already had a store of “beating the impossible odds” and “innovation on your feet” stories. It was already lore that the founders had pivoted from simply building an entire computer that fit on a single-circuit board with a newfangled Intel microprocessor to selling complete Each subsequent deal with a major computer customer was celebrated (deals were worth ten of millions of dollars) and our salespeople were feted as heroes. When any special custom engineering effort was required to match the over-the-top sales commitments (almost every deal), the engineers were treated as heroes as well. And when marketing went out to the field on Finally, there were rituals and celebrations that accompanied each big order. Bells and gongs would ring. The CEO would hand out $100 bills, and gave out a $25,000 on-the-spot bonus that was talked about for years. Once he even spray-painted an exhortation to ship a new product on time on our main hallway wall (so crude I can’t even paraphrase it, but still remembered 30 years later).While my title, business card and job description described my job functions, these unwritten values, stories, heroes and rituals guided the behavior that was expected of me in my job.I’ve learned more about a company’s corporate beliefs, heroes and rituals by sitting in on a few casual coffee breaks and lunches than reading all of its corporate mission statements or inspirational posters in the cafeteria. In These core values and beliefs and the attendant stories, heroes and rituals, also define To create an innovation culture a company needs heroes and stories about employees who created new business models, new products and new customers. Stories about new product lines created out of a crazy idea. Or heroes like an old-guard manager who kept sending the best teams to the corporate incubator; or division general managers who adapted and adopted an acquired product and built it into a successful product line, or engineering teams who got out of the building, saw a customer need and built a product to serve it — and ended up with a new division. And the rituals and rewards need to support this type of innovation (not just existing execution).Culture change almost always runs into problems — resistance to change (we’ve always done in this way), obsolescence (the world changed but not our values), inconsistency (we give lip service to our values, but don’t really implement them). But the combination of hacking the culture and reinforcing it by changing the incentives can make it happen.The result of an innovation culture is a large company with a unified purpose that can move with speed, agility and passion.Customer Development  Secret History, Teaching at Stanford, Berkeley and ColumbiaHandpicked business, marketing, design, and technology articles for entrepreneurs and startups.

Using our company The advice here is startup/domain-name specific, so if you’re looking for broad advice that might apply to the non-startup world, there are a host of resources available. It’s important to consider the primary goal of your name. The two most common directions to consider are:There will likely be some overlap between the two directions, but it’s helpful to choose a path in order to anchor your brainstorming and decision-making process.It’s also important to consider the future.For example, Dollar Shave Club is an incredible name for a brand that sells inexpensive razors every month, but if they’d like to extend their product line, their name becomes slightly confusing and potentially misleading. In contrast, Harry’s, their main competitor, is building a premium bathroom brand with a wide range of products, and their name doesn’t pose any problems.The following qualities are central to a great name. It’s not necessary to possess all of them, but they are definite Does your name possess any of the following qualities? If so, consider it a Below you’ll find an exhaustive list of ideas and resources for naming startups. Not every direction will apply to every company, but taking a few minutes to consider the entire process will help generate ideas and potentially lead you on a path you might not have taken otherwise.Devise a long list of words associated with your company: its values; the product you’re developing; the industry you are a part of; etc. Be exhaustive.Once the list is complete, comb through each entry on your list and start to build a web of synonyms associated with every word. Introduce yourself to a thesaurus, it will become your best friend. It will also help to Google image search from time to time, as it might unearth a handful of unconventional associations you might not have generated on your own.As you continue to develop a set of synonyms and associated words, it’s wise to build a wordmap to help visualize your progress. A few avenues to explore might be:The key is to brainstorm a ton of associative angles and generate an exhaustive web of synonyms until you find yourself gravitating towards something substantial. Ideally, you’ll have enough material that you’ll be able to cherry pick your favorites.Once you delve into a specific direction below, we’ll recommend a variety of corresponding tools. That said, we’ve also created a short list of valuable resources for general brainstorming, including:This is the only tool on the list that costs money ($12 for 30 days) but it’s well worth the fee. Namestation performs the tasks of almost all of the other tools combined, and you won’t need more than 30 days to brainstorm a name (so the $12 fee is a one time expense).If you’re feeling especially lazy, you can put the public to work for you: Namestation will organize a name contest at your behest. Another good tool for those who’d prefer not to pay for a name contest is The compound word is likely the most common breed of startup name, and for good reason: they’re the most satisfying to brainstorm. The process is fairly simple: brainstorm a collection of descriptive or abstract words related to your company, combine them, and repeat until something sticks.Some well-known examples of startups that utilize compound words include: Facebook, Snapchat, EverNote, Firefox, Photobucket, Salesforce, Wordpress, YouTube, Flipboard, PaypalAnother common trend among startups is the combination of two commonly used words that would otherwise function as a part of a grammatically sound sentence.We recommend Well-known examples of startups that utilize compound phrases include: DropBox, LinkedIn, MySpace, SecondLife, StumbleUpon, About.Me, Kickstarter, OpentableMylo Rejects: BacktoBasics, SoSimple, MyNeeds, EveryWear, ShopDrawerIf you’re a relatively unknown startup, word of mouth is valuable, which means it’s important for your name to stick. If you’re chatting with someone about a streaming music service, it’s fairly easy to remember a rhyming name like Soundcloud off the top of your head.The last thing you want is someone to Google search “streaming music” when they’re looking for your product specifically. Chances are, the brand leader in your category will show up long before they find you. In short, compound rhyming names tend to stick.Well-known examples of startups that utilize compound rhyming names include: SoundCloud, GrubHub, SeatGeek, Fitbit, SunrunMylo Rejects: BestDressed, Hi!Buy, RequiredAttire, He’dNeed, DudsBudWithout a major budget, it’s tough to crack open a dictionary, choose a word you like, and create a web domain. The reason? Domain squatters have probably beat you to it. Fortunately, if you’ve found a word that you like, there are a number of creative ways to alter your potential name and secure a solid domain.A portmanteau is a linguistic blend of words that combines their respective sounds  meanings to create a brand new word.Portmanteus make for extremely strong names because of their potential to communicate your company’s ethos, purpose, and direction. If you’ve created a solid portmanteau, it will sound like a word that’s always existed.Well-known examples of startups that utilize portmanteaus include: Pinterest, Zenefits, SpaceX, Yelp, Netscape, Microsoft, Instagram, EpicuriousMylo Rejects: Simplenty, Refineed, Needit, Grabasics, YessentialsAdding a prefix, suffix, or number to a preferred word is an effortless way to find an available domain. On occasion, this can result in a great name, but you also run the risk of sounding contrived and/or A more conservative direction is to add a common word to the front or back end of your name to secure a domain. Mylo’s domain (www.mylo.com) is owned by a squatter, so we devised a list of simple, catchy words to compliment Mylo, and we eventually decided on okmylo.com.Well-known examples of startups that utilize suffixes include: Spotify, Cloudera, Friendster, Napster, Shopify, Visual.ly, Bit.lyMylo Rejects: Simplete, Incommon, Eversimple, Commonwear, Basic.ly, Himylo, Heymylo, Seemylo, Myloshop, MylogoodsMisspelling a word by substituting, adding, or removing a letter is another common tactic used in domain acquisition. Names generated this way can be distinctive, meaningful, and short. Unfortunately, they can also sound contrived, so it’s important to take special care when brainstorming this way.Well-known examples of startups that misspell words include: Flipkart, Lyft, Houzz, Flickr, Tumblr, Digg, RedditMylo Rejects: Basix, Grabbit, Simpl, Fownd, SolloUnfortunately, re-purposed words are difficult to use. If they’re utilized in a descriptive sense, they’re not protectable trademarks. It’s possible to use them in an indirect or metaphorical sense, but you’ll need a great deal of money to secure a dormant domain.The following tips take this into account, and reflect these limitations.Since the dawn of trade, businesses have been named after real people. In the tech world, the most famous examples are Dell, Hewlett Packard, and Craigslist. In recent years, a trend has emerged where fictional personas function as a company namesake.Well-known examples of startups that are named after non-existent people include: Oscar, Warby Parker, AlfredMylo Rejects: Milo, Mijlo, Kiko, Umi, JanOn occasion, a random, slightly unrelated name might strike you out of the blue — a name so perfect you can’t believe you hadn’t thought of it earlier. These occasions feel magical, but they’re usually the result of hours of research and brainstorming, and often surface the moment your mind is given a second to relax.The following names may or may not have been a result of the “lightning bolt” effect, but their brilliant ability to communicate their brand’s core values while maintaining an abstract distance is interesting.These brands include: Apple, Amazon, Google, Slack, ViceMylo Rejects: Sift, Keep, Select, Solo, NabWhile the previous batch of names seemed to be plucked at random, they at least possess an associative tie to their brand — they manage to communicate something about their business in a symbolic way.There are other brands, however, whose names seem to have fallen from the sky without any sort of tie to the business they conduct. At times, these names work, but it’s difficult to provide a strong reason why. It’s a subjective field at best. Fire away!Well-known examples of startups that make use of miscellaneous words include: Uber, Square, Stripe, Monster, Sun, Lotus, WinkMylo Rejects: Kin, Tab, Tandem, Ilk, MintThe clock is ticking, your deadline fast approaching, and you’re no closer to finding a word that captures your brand’s purpose, let alone its ethos. Your thesaurus is bone dry, you’ve mined all of your father’s compound puns, and you’re still exactly where you started.It may be a Hail Mary, but it’s not uncommon for brands to create a brand new word in order to capture their essence.Well-known examples of startups that invented brand new words include: Zynga, Zappos, TheranosMylo Rejects: Oomi, Vound, Iba, Mibro, RobiIf your startup already has an established name that feels a touch dated, conservative, or dull, you may have an easy solution on your hands, especially if your name happens to be three or four words long.It’s also fairly common for businesses that feature the names of founders to use an acronym. IBM (International Business Machines Corporation) is an excellent example of a company with a previously sterile name.Other well-known examples of startups that use acronyms include: AirBNB, AOL, ICQ, AIMIf you’ve mind mapped extensively and come up with an impressive list of words, chances are you have a solid grasp of your brand values and how they interact with each other. Here’s where your subconscious is about to shine.When I’m naming a company, the name I choose often surfaces in a quiet moment. It may feel lucky and unexpected, but it’s always the result of a ton of conscious work, research, and investigation.While brainstorming Mylo, we were philosophically and aesthetically inspired by MUJI and IKEA. We liked the degree to which they were rooted in the identity of their nations: Japan and Sweden, respectively. While developing our brand, it became obvious that we should be rooted in my Dutch heritage.The Netherlands embodies many of the values we’d already considered, and my mother’s family owned a prominent auction house that sold furniture near Amsterdam. The foundation seemed to be laid, especially when our ultimate plans to move into basic homewares and furniture were considered.After searching unsuccessfully for a Dutch word that captured our ethos, I remembered that my mother originally intended to call me Kiko, a name I hadn’t given much thought since I was younger.The name wasn’t quite right, but it prompted me to research Holland’s most popular male names — a list that included Milo. The name stuck out — it felt right immediately. It was short, catchy, and friendly. To avoid confusion with Milo, a very popular chocolate milk drink in Southeast Asia, we switched the i to y, and Mylo was born.You’ve created mind maps, exhausted every resource on the internet, and brainstormed a list of your favorite names, so how do you finally choose? Usually there’s one name that “feels right”. In the case that you don’t have a clear winner, the following tips may help.Most of the aforementioned tools automatically check for domain availability, and ideally there aren’t any unavailable names on your list, but if you haven’t checked, now is the time. Next up, you want to verify your name’s availability across the social media platforms you intend to use. Typing your name into If your domain, social, and Google searches haven’t yielded a competitive term for the name you’re interested in, chances are it doesn’t exist. That said, it’s best to double check to make sure that no one else has trademarked the name.To determine whether your name may cause you legal trouble, check competing names to see if their trademark is still live. It’s always wise to research their industry and locale as well. This can be done quickly in the U.S. at Have a conversation about your company with friends and family. When you’re describing what you do, namedrop your favorite name option. After the conversation, ask them if they remember what the name of the company is, and if so, ask them to spell it to you.If they’re struggling to remember your name or how to spell it, you may want to consider making a slight revision to make it simpler.It’s also a great idea to test the names you like at Now that you’ve read our tips and devoured the aforementioned resources, you’re a step closer to choosing a name for your startup.

Six years ago, when I made the switch from On the surface, the two vocations could not be more divergent: non-profit versus for-profit; public institution versus free market; chalkboard  textbook versus Google analytics  expansion playbook; curriculum building versus consumer product design; and so on.Here are some of the striking similarities between running a classroom and running an early-stage company.Both the CEO and the teacher are responsible for curating a memorable experience, either for employees or students. Clarify their purpose. Hint at the great value that lies ahead if they stick with the process. Assure them that they have everything they need to succeed. Don’t clog the experience with superfluities and distractions; focus on the essential thing. Make the process itself delightful. Engage curiosity. Build them up through small victories and motivate them through moments of profound, perceived value. Release them from any scaffolding you’ve constructed so they experience their own self-sufficient competency. Understand and evaluate their success in order to further refine the experience. Individualize content. Promote collaboration. Reward them for contributing value to the ecosystem and express gratitude for their participation. Inspire them to share unabashedly with anyone who will listen. Find the very best among them and let them go wild. Make it real. Make it matter!These are instructions in product design — a core competency of the start-up CEO. These are also instructions in curriculum design — the essential skill of the modern teacher.Getting a group of tremendously smart, motivated, skillful, sleep-deprived adults to rapidly deploy, iterate on, and market multiple product lines amidst fierce competition and a fickle market is approximately as hard as getting a group of disgruntled, previously poorly-educated, sleep-deprived, profoundly curious young people with hearts of gold to learn something of genuine import.Surprisingly, the key to both is getting out of the way.I once mentored a talented student teacher who decided to apply for a full-time teaching role at our school. As part of her interview she taught a “sample class” in a structure called Literature Circles in which students talk in small groups about a book they’re reading. The kids came in. She said, “Ok, Literature Circles, get to it.” And for the next hour she walked around the classroom with a clipboard silently watching the students as they talked about What was noticeable was the students. By the end of class, each student had been assessed by their group on several individual metrics (e.g., using examples in discussion, reading for details, etc). They had engaged in a thematic, in-depth dialogue of a difficult novel. They had practiced specific skills (e.g., noticing metaphors). They had collaborated in teams. And there was palpable excitement about the protagonist Bigger and his disturbed journey. It was a killer class, so to speak.To the untrained eye, the teacher did almost nothing. But every teacher knows that behind each minute of classroom fluidity lies hundreds of hours of preparation: building processes, setting expectations, clarifying vision.It’s no different as a start-up CEO. They say the three jobs of the CEO are to define the vision, hire great people, and make sure there is cash in the bank. I’d add that CEOs should build a culture of intense productivity and efficiency. If you achieve these four things, you will have nothing to do. (Obviously this isn’t true, but you get the idea…).Hire amazing human beings, give them the resources they need, make the goal clear and inspiring, get everyone on the same page about how all the parts work together to ensure maximum productivity — and then get out of the way.Data-driven companies are all the rage. Precisely the same principles apply to the classroom.I became a data-driven teacher long before I was a data-driven start-up founder. By my last year of teaching, I was often giving students dozens of quantitative grades during every class. I would put a spreadsheet transparency on an overhead (remember those?) and would add micro-grades to it throughout the class. I would then add the grades to our school’s online grading system.The students got addicted to checking — and improving — their grades. I had essentially created a transparent, real-time metrics dashboard for my students — and for me. (To be honest, I might have gone a bit overboard.)It’s the same for the CEO. You want every person in your company to qualitatively understand their goals and their progress towards these goals.The teacher and the CEO both need to set clear, smart goals and ensure that data is transparently and accurately available about the degree to which these goals are being realized. Then magic happens — and everyone knows damn well it isn’t magic.The teacher and start-up CEO are each solely responsible for the success of the processes they are overseeing. This means that failure holds a special place in both of their hearts — its dark side and its importance.As a teacher, a mistake means classroom hell. And classroom hell is a special kind of hell that you want to avoid at all costs. There’s a reason they say you should never smile until Christmas — and it isn’t because you’re holding out for presents. If you err in October, you’re going to have a very very long year. As a CEO, a mistake means company hell — also to be aggressively avoided. Both the teacher and the CEO understand well the adage: never f#$ up the same thing twice.This is obvious for the start-up CEO. A significant percentage of new companies fail; that is, you must risk failure in order to succeed. Indeed, a striking number of successful companies find success after various earlier struggles. Innovation, by its very nature, is a flirtation with failure. You have to break the rules of prior success in order to make something truly new.This is less obvious for teaching, which some people think of as a by-the-book vocation — as though a single winning curricular formulation might solve the multitude of micro challenges that pave the path to substantive learning in each unique child. Consider this: how many really good teachers did you have in the first 18 years of your life? Certainly fewer than five. Maybe just one. Maybe zero. Sounds a good bit like the ratio of successful companies to failed ones. The book on great teaching is not written. State standards are, at best, a series of guiding cairns. As a teacher, you are inventing it as you go. A hundred times a week. And so, like an inventor, you learn via failure.For the CEO and teacher, every failure is both wrenching and precious.Finally, both the CEO and teacher create value by helping people understand and realize their unique potential. That is, the process of value creation starts inside.As a teacher, over time I came to see that my fundamental task wasn’t to teach American History — but to teach young people about who they were, how their minds worked, how they could realize and unlock their huge potential. American History was the excuse, the context — and it was critical; without a rigorous learning experience, the deeper learning would end up groundless. But without the deeper learning, the American History learning would be superficial and ultimately deadening.Likewise, part of your job as CEO — an important part, particularly in the early stages — is to build a work culture that inspires your team to be great. It’s no coincidence that Jack Ma, the CEO of Alibaba — the company with the most successful IPO ever — was first a teacher.At root, the early-stage CEO and teacher share an unquenchable drive to create deep value for humans. They have a unique, inspired vision that they Collectively, we are doing a tremendous job honoring and supporting our early-stage CEOs. Indeed, as an increasingly start-up and entrepreneur-obsessed culture, we’re coming to recognize CEOs as conductors of our culture’s creative progress.While we pay lip service to the importance of education and the nobility of teachers, we don’t come close to offering them the concrete manifestations of honor that we afford our CEOs.Luckily, being a teacher — like being a start-up CEO — is profoundly fulfilling independent of compensation and status. Luckily so, because the job can be lonely and humbling. It puts a mirror in front of you that you can’t avoid. It requires that you understand your unique vision and that you fight tooth and nail to pass this vision on to the world, day in and day out.Even so, every bit of support from the outside helps. Every cheer matters. Every dollar — the most concrete manifestation of our collective respect — makes it more likely that each of our teachers becomes better and better, that our great teachers stay teachers, and that our great students at least consider becoming great teachers.BrightEntrepreneur, Product Thinker, and Writer.

The online tools I use to get ideas quickly  cheaply out into the worldIt feels like we’re in a new period of easy-to-use online tools to test, launch and build our projects. We don’t need developers or designers and the biggest challenge is finding the time to figure out which tools work best for our idea.In workshops at Whatever you need the answer is always: Its been done, a tool has been created for this purpose and it won’t be expensive. Of course, time is pretty valuable — so hopefully some of these will help save you some of that, as well as the cash too.One thing is for sure, there is no excuse for not pushing your idea cheaply, quickly and smartly out into the world to get feedback before you throw real time and money at it.For personal branding, user-testing, product launches or full-blown businesses.Rapid feedback on ideas, prototypes and products can lead to quality market validation and future campaigns.Taking payments is a big one for most startups and this is where I’ve seen the biggest jumps forward over the last couple of years.Email: Sometimes its best to cut out the fluff and just email.

Uzaktan bakınca bizim girişimcilik mahallesi çok çekici gözüküyor.Son beş yılda sürekli artan bir basın ilgisi, melek yatırımcılar, milyon dolarlık raundlar, ürün ve yeni şirket lansmanları, konferanslar, partiler, yurtiçi ve yurtdışı ödüller sayesinde bitmek bilmeyen başarı hikayeleriyle bezeli bir dünyadaymışız gibi bir hava var…Hele arada patlatılan bomba satınalmalar, “exit”ler, girişimciliğe ve startup’lara olan iştahı her geçen gün daha da kabartıyor.Ancak gerçekler yukarıdaki reklam panosundan çok daha farklı, girişimciler için ekmek, değil aslanın ağzında hatta midesinde…Kurulan her 10 startup’tan dokuz tanesi ilk 18 ay içerisinde kapanıyor. Yani startup ölüm oranı yüzde 90 civarında…Ben de aktif bir girişimci ve yatırımcı olarak çok başarılı girişimlerin yanı sıra başarısız girişimlere de yakından tanıklık ediyorum.Bazıları faturası çok yüksek dersler olsa da, bu sayede startup’ları öldüren ve hayatta tutan sebepleri çok daha yakından görme şansına eriştim.Aşağıda Türk startup’ların başarısızlık sebeplerini, biraz da alaturka olanları ön planda tutarak mercek altına aldım:Türkiye’de maalesef iş hayatında en büyük ihtiyaç duyduğumuz unsur güven. Ödemesini zamanında yapmayan firmalar, sözleşmesine sadık kalmayan girişimciler, çekleri karşılıksız çıkan tedarikçiler bu coğrafyada genel bir güvensizlik atmosferinin ortaya çıkmasına sebep oluyor.İş veya sosyal hayat fark etmiyor, güvenin olmadığı yerde Türkiye’de çoğu girişimci ezbere iş yapıyor, sektörüne tam olarak hakim değil.Teknik ya da değil, hiçbir dokümanı başından sonuna kadar dikkatli okumuyor ve kendisini geliştiremiyor.Türk girişimcisi yine de nereden geldiği belli olmayan bir cesaret ile altyapısı olmadan çok riskli işlere girişebiliyor. Risk almak ile cahil cesareti arasında ince bir çizgi varsa, sanırım bunu göremiyor.Bu kısmı uzun uzun yazmaya lüzum yok. Vizyonunuzu paylaşmayan, azminize ayak uyduramayan, icraat yerine siyaset yapan ortaklarla kesinlikle yola çıkmayın.Türkiye’deki temel yanlışlardan bir tanesi ortaklıkların yukarıdaki temeller yerine fazlasıyla farazi ve duygusal temeller üzerine inşa edilmesi.Diğer problem ise çok konuşup az iş yapan sözde ortaklar…Mahallede yeni açılan Kardeşler kuruyemişçisinin yanına hemen bir kuruyemişçi daha açıp “Öz Kardeşler Kuruyemiş” diyoruz.“Bizim taksi”nin yan sokağına “Öz Bizim Taksi”, Urfa kebabçısının karşısına “Öz Urfa”…Türkiye’ye özgü klasik bir start up hatası “Öz Startup” zihniyetinden kurtulamamaktır.Her şeyin kayıtsız şartsız kopyasını yaparak daha olgunlaşmamış bir pazarı gereğinden fazla kalabalıklaştırıyoruz. Sonuç olarak da kimsenin kâr edemediği ve katma değerin ortaya çıkmadığı bir ekosistem oluşuyor.Bu “öz” mantığından kurtulup “özgün”e doğru gitmemiz gerek. Özgün fikirler ve uygulama yöntemleriyle yola çıkmayan start up’lar, ya ölüme mahkum olacaklar ya da fazlasıyla kalabalıklaştırdıkları pazardaki diğer oyuncuları da yarattıkları girdapta boğacaklar.Bugüne kadar yatırım yaptığım Türk startup’larından neredeyse hiçbirisi düzenli bir finansal raporlama sistemi kuramadı. Aylık, çeyreklik gelir tablosu, nakit akışı ve bilançolarını paylaşmaları için özel olarak markaja almamız, hatta başlarında durmamız gerekiyor.Bir çok Türk girişimcisi ürününe aşık olmasına, pazarını da çok iyi bilmesine rağmen, finans ve muhasebe konusunda sınıfta kaldığı için şirketlerini sürdürülebilir bir yapıya oturtamıyor.Yatırımcılar da doğal olarak hesap kitap bilmeyen girişimciye yatırım yapmaya yanaşmıyor.Hukuki metinler bir girişimcinin hayatının merkezindedir.Şirketi kurarken, yatırımcı alırken, satarken, müşteri ile anlaşırken, çalışanları işe alırken, kısaca bir çok kritik dönemeç kontratlarla bezeli.Bazı kontratlar işinizi az bilen, dışardan destek veren avukatlara emanet edilmeyecek kadar önemlidir.Sözleşmelerden, hukuki metinlerden korkmayın. Faaliyet gösterdiğiniz alandaki tüm mevzuatı avucunuzun içi gibi bilin.Bir girişimin tohum veya melek yatırım almasını dünya turuna çıkan bir motosiklet sürücüsünün sadece ilk 500 kilometre için deposunu doldurması olarak özetleyebiliriz.Oysa bizim coğrafyada ilk tur yatırımı adeta bir “exit” gibi değerlendiren girişimciler var, ilk kaynaklarını çar çur ettikleri için daha sonra gerçekten ihtiyaçları olacak sermayeye ulaşamıyorlar.Yanlış harcamalarla yatırımcılarını hayal kırıklığına uğratırken, bazen de finansal gerçekleri onlardan saklayarak yatırım parasını kişisel harcamalarında kullanıyorlar. Bu hareketler hem girişimlerin ölmesine neden oluyor, hem de tüm ekosisteme zarar veriyor.80li yıllarda Turgut Özal’in “İcraatin İçinden” programını çok karikatürize etmiştik ama bugün o vizyonu takdir ediyorum.Bir girişimi kurmak veya hayata geçirmek kolay değil, ancak o girişimin işleyen ve icra eden bir kurum haline gelmesi kuruluş aşamasından belki de beş kat daha zor.İngilizcede “Execution” olarak ifade edilen ve Türkçe’ye en güzel “icraat” olarak çevirebileceğimiz kavram, herhangi bir girişimin başarısının temelini oluşturuyor.Biz Pozitron çatısı altında mobil teknoloji alanına girerken, rakip olarak adlandırabileceğimiz en az beş tane firma vardı.Benzer teknolojilere sahip olmamıza ve aynı alanda faaliyet göstermemize rağmen kısa zamanda pazar lideri olmamızı “icraat” odaklı yönetime borçluyuz.Girişimcilik serüvenimde çok değerli, çok potansiyeli olan rakipler gördüm, ancak yanlış ürün ve platformda ısrar ettikleri için o potansiyellerine ulaşamadan silinip gittiler.Esnek yapılar darbelere daha dayanıklı olur, Türkiye gibi darbenin nereden ve ne zaman geleceği belli olmayan pazarlarda esnek bir ürün ve esnek bir yapı kurmazsanız orta şiddetteki ilk depremde yerle bir olursunuz.Doğru zamanda, doğru pazarı yakalayıp, rüzgarı arkasına almışken kapasitesi sınırlı bir ürün çıkartarak yükselen talebe karşılık kaliteyi, tedariği ve beklentileri yönetememek ölümlerin en acıklısı olabilir.Global örnek: 15 yıl öncesinin en popüler sosyal ağı olan Dijital tüketici nankördür, bir kere sizden soğudu mu tekrar gönlünü almak çok zordur.Türkiye’de bir start-up kurucusu olmak beklentinin aksine bütün gün boyunca en sevdiginiz işi yapmak anlamına gelmiyor.Eğer bir işe girişiyorsanız yukarıda saydığım gibi muhasebe ve finanstan tutun, insan kaynaklarından operasyona, satın almadan tedarik zincirine kadar her şeyde az da olsa bilgi sahibi olmanız gerekiyor.Ortaklarınızla birlikte şirketinizin tüm süreçlerine hakim olmazsanız, daha fırtına bile çıkmadan ilk dalgada alabora olabilirsiniz.Başarı ancak, tutku ile icra edebilme yeteneğinin bir araya gelmesiyle ortaya çıkıyor.Herkeste gördüğümüz “confidential” hastalığı sanırım 90lı yıllardan kalma bir gelenek. Merak etmeyin, insanlar sizin o parlak fikrinizi çalmak için sıraya girmiyor.Türkiye’de start up geçmişi olmayan çaylak girişimcilerin başarılı olabilmek için şeffaf olmaları, yurt dışındaki literatürü takip ederek girişimlerinde yaşadıkları sıkıntıları mentor olarak gördüğü insanlarla paylaşmaları gerekiyor.Confidential tuzağına düşmeyin. Fikrinizi paylaşın ve geri bildirimleri değerlendirin.—Kıssadan hisse: Türkiye hayal etmesi kolay fakat icra etmesi zor bir ülkedir.Kendimiz kandırmayalım, hiçbir StartUp yukarıda saydığımız yanlışlardan en az bir tanesini yapmadan finiş çizgisine gelemez.Bu nedenle girişimciler yanlış yapmaktan korkmasınlar, ama yanlışlardan ders almazlarsa o zaman hurda girişim mezarlığında yerleri şimdiden hazır olur.Co-founder of 

E porque saí do Vale do SilícioHá um ano, eu deixei San Francisco, vendi ou dei tudo o que tinha, e fiz a minha mudança para uma mochila de 40 litros.Viajei por 45 cidades de 20 países, 3 Disneylands e 1Também trabalhei 50 horas por semana construindo e lançando uma E meus custos totais foram menores do que o aluguel em San Francisco sozinho.Há uma crescente comunidade de “nômades digitais” que vivem um estilo de vida independente de localização. Nós somos desenvolvedores de software, designers, escritores, jornalistas, engenheiros e todo tipo de pessoa que compartilha uma paixão pelo trabalho que fazemos e por conhecer o mundo.Três anos atrás, estava me preparando para sair do meu emprego na Microsoft e me mudar para San Francisco para abrir uma startup. Um amigo me perguntou: “Mas por que você precisa estar em San Francisco quando pode trabalhar em um computador de qualquer lugar?” A pergunta fez muito sentido. Conforme pensava mais no assunto, comecei a questionar minhas suposições sobre uma “vida normal”, que não fazem sentido em nosso mundo moderno.Então lá fui eu, com minhas novas e loucas ideias sobre a vida na estrada.Mas não deu muito certo.Depois de viajar por 6 meses, eu desisti e me mudei de volta para San Francisco. Viajar era legal, mas eu tinha uma grande ideia e precisava realmente manter o foco e trabalhar. Que outro lugar seria melhor para construir minha startup do que o Vale do Silício?Mas logo percebi que comecei me acomodar demais e a diminuir o ritmo. Eu me entediava, me distraía facilmente e estava assistindo muita TV. Eu me sentava em frente ao computador por 12 horas por dia, mas não me sentia produtivo.Em uma viagem a Nova York, meus amigos iam trabalhar durante o dia. Assim, eu saía para trabalhar em cafeterias e no Central Park. De repente, minha produtividade aumentou tremendamente, e eu passei a fazer muito mais em 6 horas do que nas minhas habituais 12 horas diárias. O mesmo aconteceu alguns meses depois, em uma viagem a Londres. Eu estava até mesmo tendo ideias melhores, porque as novas experiências e os novos ares estavam mantendo minha mente mais ativa.Tendo descoberto o padrão, fui embora de San Francisco há um ano e passei então a me dedicar inteiramente ao estilo de vida nômade. Desta vez, sinto que compreendi. Eu estou feliz, produtivo, conhecendo pessoas excelentes, aprendendo sobre grandes problemas globais a serem resolvidos e lancei o Isso foi o que eu aprendi ao longo do ano passado.Este é a média de minhas despesas mensais durante um ano vivendo em Capitol Hill (Seattle), um ano vivendo em Upper Haight (San Francisco), um ano viajando por 20 países e um mês em um hotel em Bali. Viajar é muito mais barato para mim. Como a maioria dos meus custos são com trens e vôos, é significativamente mais barato se eu ficar em um só lugar.Meus amigos em San Francisco e Seattle seguidamente me perguntam: “Como você tem condições de pagar por tantas viagens?” Eu não tenho é condições de não viajar. Estou abrindo uma empresa e viver em San Francisco estava consumindo minhas economias.Inicialmente, quando comecei a viajar, eu era um belo de um turista, tirando fotos de tudo e fazendo todas as atividades listadas nos guias de turismo. Após algumas exaustivas semanas, me ocorreu que eu não estava de férias. Essa é a minha vida agora. Eu diminui o ritmo e me dei conta de que se eu tenho um mês para explorar uma nova cidade, não preciso fazer tudo de uma vez só. Posso explorar a cidade por algumas horas e ainda assim trabalhar bastante.Fiquei surpreso ao descobrir que sou significativamente mais produtivo enquanto viajo. No entanto, faz sentido. Se estou em Roma somente por uma semana, por que eu perderia meu tempo no Facebook? Estar constantemente cercado de novidades reduz meu tédio e aumenta meu foco. E ainda Eu voltei para Seattle em junho para trabalhar perto do meu sócio e bolar planos de longo prazo. Meu tempo de desenvolvimento foi surpreendentemente menos produtivo do que quando estava viajando. Fiquei sentado em frente ao computador tanto quanto, mas me distraía mais facilmente com a Internet e a TV. E mesmo estando em 6 cidades diferentes no mês de setembro, consegui trabalhar 48 horas semanais de maneira extremamente produtiva. Estar mais focado enquanto trabalho me proporciona mais tempo para aproveitar o resto da minha vida, o que é muito importante para mim.Em vez de trabalhar durante as horas de sol e empurrar todo o meu tempo livre para a pior parte do dia, eu prefiro aproveitar os dias e trabalhar à noite. Levanto da cama mais rápido quando tenho entusiasmo para sair. E quando não tenho uma rotina de deslocamento, há simplesmente muito mais tempo no dia. Gosto de trabalhar 7 dias por semana com horas flexíveis, para que eu possa tirar um dia livre quando tiver vontade ou curtir um cinema vazio às duas da tarde.Desperdicei muito tempo quando trabalhava em um escritório por causa da rotina de deslocamento e da gigantesca distração que é a Internet. Agora, divido meu trabalho ao longo do dia e faço grandes pausas para conhecer a cidade. Depois de trabalhar por algumas horas, concluo uma tarefa importante e saio explorando a cidade até querer retornar ao trabalho. Ou, se encontrar um problema que eu não consiga resolver, Minha estadia no Atualmente, tenho amigos pelo mundo todo, cujas experiências de vida são muito diferentes das minhas e trazem novas perspectivas às minhas ideias. Estou aprendendo sobre os verdadeiros problemas que afetam o mundo em uma escala global, o que me tornará um melhor empreendedor no futuro.É fácil encontrar grandes pessoas com que você pode aprender. Existem espaços de Nunca foi tão fácil viver e trabalhar como um nômade. Viajar é barato, mais produtivo, e mais inspirador do que ficar em casa. Trabalhar em um escritório é uma relíquia do passado.A revolução dos nômades digitais está apenas começando e eu estou animado em contribuir com o seu crescimento. Espero encontrar você qualquer hora dessas, em algum lugar lá fora.iOS Developer  Technology EnthusiastTraga suas histórias e ideias

The idea was simple: customers would open prepaid accounts at local shops and earn bonus credit by doing so. We would eliminate payment fragmentation and use the transactional data to automate retention and marketing for these shops. Best of all, customers did not need a smartphone, as we used their mobile number to create their account.We raised seed money from a local angel investor early on, joined an My This time around, I was adamant that I would build a team from day one — and that is exactly what I did. I found someone that I could work with, that had similar experience as me and most importantly was able to commit all of their time right away. Not long after that, I persuaded a German developer I knew to stay in London and not return home (after working at another failed startup), but to join us on our journey, as we felt we were executing quickly.It was not until we started talking to institutional investors several months later, that we realised they viewed us as having no credibility in the space we were attacking and that no early traction, innovative approach or growing metrics would save us.Investors wanted to see former payments, daily deal and retail executives as the team behind Tab—not three random guys trying their hand at “disrupting a crowded space”. It was not that this was a deal breaker for investors, but because of some of the other mistakes we made, it played a major part in the slow demise of Tab.As co-founders, we all had different (short) personal runways, which made money a real concern. Early on, we were lucky enough to meet an angel investor from the finance space that wanted to put the first money in to Tab. We thought this initial seed money would not only solve our cash-flow issues, but would also be a great signal for other investors and would allow us to build our first product.It was clear that if we did not take this money, Tab would have never been more than a paper prototype — so we took the money. This started a proverbial time bomb that we would never be able to stop: we started taking small salaries that we relied on each month and exhausted our personal savings for anything else we needed. It also made fundraising and cash-flow a priority from day one.Looking back, we should have continued working part-time until we had a simple digital prototype and early revenue before we raised any external funds. Further, the funds should have only been used for running experiments, marketing expenses and outsourcing the development of things we could not do ourselves.While our first angel investor helped us get started, it was not a good enough signal for institutional investors, as they were looking for industry experts putting money in. It was also evident that we either needed to be a killer team that has done it before and raise a lot early and quickly, or have crazy traction and growth to get their attention.In September of last year, we had lunch with a It went very well and in a few weeks we had more than 30 consumers using Tab to prepay for their coffees and pastries, and they used their identification card to pay for future purchases. It became apparent that it was very hard for shops to handle transactions this way and they almost begged us to build a digital version to make it quicker at the point of sale and reduce human error (which was appallingly high).The problem was that we wanted all the bells and whistles from day one: payment processing, account profiles, multiple locations, transaction histories, email receipts and more. The result was that we ended up building something completely different than what we tested and we built too many features without validating they were needed. We had to quickly start customer development again and ended up rebuilding Tab from the ground-up, which took us another 8 weeks.We should have quickly turned our paper prototype into a simple digital prototype — nothing more, nothing less. We could have then quickly iterated, skipping features that were not needed and building features that shops actually wanted (and would pay for).One of the General Partners at Seedcamp happened to be the first consumer to use Tab at our very first pilot location, the cafe at Google Campus in Shoreditch, East London. We got excited about the idea of being a part of Seedcamp and what it could do for us as a company: open doors, keep our ticking time bomb going and provide us with a stamp of approvalWe tried to join to Seedcamp twice (once traveling all the way to Portugal and once on home turf in London) and we were accepted the second time around. Each event needed our attention for around three weeks: one week to get prepared, one week of mentoring and investor demos, and another week following-up with everyone we met. In total, we spent at least 6 weeks of time devoted to getting in to Seedcamp that could have been used to talk to our customers and iterate our product (or lack of product in the first case).We launched our first product the day we finally got accepted into Seedcamp, so we had no product validation at this point; we were not ready to start scaling in any shape or form. In hindsight, we should have spent those weeks solely on product development and iteration and applied to an accelerator only when we felt we were close to product-market fit and were ready to start scaling.Seedcamp has changed me as an individual, and for that I am ever grateful for participating, but as a company we were not ready to reap the full benefits the programme had to offer.One of the biggest opportunities Seedcamp offers new portfolio companies is to go on a 3-week long trip to New York, Boston, San Francisco and Silicon Valley. We visited some of the biggest names in technology including Google, Facebook and Foursquare, and pitched some of the best venture capitalists around. This trip really opened my eyes as to how different American founders/investors are compared with the more relaxed and timid European counterparts we were.This trip came a couple weeks after we joined Seedcamp and released our first product — so it was not the best timing. During my time away on the trip, product and business development dropped to a glacial pace. At a time when we should have been solely focused on talking to customers and iterating the product It turns out that hype does not build successful companies — successful teams and products do. As tensions started to rise and shortly after my return to London we parted ways with one of our co-founders (whom we luckily remain good friends with today). We should have postponed this trip to save time (and money) so that we could have had a clear objective and reason to travel halfway around the world at time when our product needed our full attention. It is great to see how our experience and other learnings are already being integrated at Seedcamp: new companies now have two opportunities a year to go to the USA, so they can make the trip when it is best for their companies.As we had already raised some funding and joined Seedcamp, we started regularly interacting with investors as they came in to the office and at other events. The majority of the investors we spoke with warned us that they would need to see proof that we could scale Tab beyond a couple pilot locations. They wanted us to prove that we could execute our ambitious plans on a smaller scale.Our biggest mistake was listening to these investors too much, and we started focusing our efforts on how we could make Tab more investable rather thanOnce we started scaling-up shops and building a sales team, we were no longer raising money on a vision — we were raising money on our metrics. As we only had several months of runway left, we did not have the cash to keep our early growth levels and quickly picked all the low hanging fruit we could. We should have resisted investor pressure to start scaling, especially as our product was so young and untested.At the end of the day, shops wanted two things from Tab: to make more money and to save more money. Anecdotally, Tab did just that and increased the spending of customers and saved shops money by bundling card payments. The problem was that we were not able to show this to shops.We spent a lot of time building features that made Tab qualitatively better than incumbents, but that were not necessarily quantitatively helping shops. This made it extremely hard to convince shops to pay for Tab, even if they had processed several thousand transactions and had hundreds of customers using the service.For example, we required no app to download or barcode to scan for customers to open an account and we passed the transaction onus on to the shop, which meant customers did not need to show anything to pay. As much as both shops and customers loved this, shops could not put a price on the value.There were potential features that we knew could provide quantifiable value, such as the ability to communicate with customers, to view analytical information and to send rewards or perks to customers to bring them back in the door. All of these features could present a quantifiable return for shops, but we were late to deliver them.As we were using shops as guinea pigs for customer and product development, we offered Tab for free to shops. This made it very easy for us to sign up new shops, especially when they saw their competitors in the local area were using Tab.We assumed that if shops piloted Tab, they would see the value and would convert later on when we had a fully-baked product. This hurt us in a few ways: we did not have any revenue being generated, which was a red flag for investors and the feedback we were getting from shops was different than if they were paying.We should have charged shops a small flat fee from the beginning. This would have not only extended our runway by a few months, but would have allowed us to iterate the financial model, just as we were iterating the product.We did not build any real financial models until one of our existing investor asked us for one. I mean, we wrote on the back of napkins and that sort of thing, but nothing that looked at how the company would scale in the coming years.It was a shocking experience when we realised how much capital we really needed to scale Tab and how little the return was after subtracting acquisition, support costs and other overheads.If we had built a simple financial model earlier on, we would have seen the flaws in our business model and we could have attempted to fix them before it was too late; we could have easily shifted focus to features that could have generated more revenue for us.We quickly realised that direct sales was the best approach to convert shops in to piloting Tab, so we put all of our eggs in one basket and focused solely on direct sales. This meant that we never really tested online sales or teaming up with a distribution partner.This was a big mistake, as when it came time to fundraise, we could not show that one or the other would help lower our blended acquisition costs or that is was viable for us to pivot from direct sales to online sales if needed—and potential raise money for this pivot.Tab will be turned off on December 31st, 2013—until then shops will be able to debit accounts, but not accept new top ups or new signups.We want to to thank We also want to thank —Product 

Twenty years ago, the book The book’s premise is that every technology has an adoption life cycle. Start-up products initially appeal to “innovators,” people who want to try every new thing, but who are seldom willing to spend very much (if anything) for products that interest them. Then come the “visionaries,” early adopters willing to take a chance on a new product if it solves a burning problem. All they need is a proof of concept to take the leap of faith. After the visionaries come the “pragmatists.” No matter how well a product serves their needs, they buy only after friends or colleagues have recommended it. Typically, the pragmatists or the “early majority” represent by far the largest market segment. The “late majority,” conservatives who buy only after a product has become the standard, follow the early majority. Finally come the “laggards,” who never buy.The chasm lies between the early adopter and early majority stages. A Geoffrey Moore, the book’s author, argues that companies must first dominate a niche of early adopters and expand from a position of strength to succeed. This advice contrasts with the view, commonly held by many of today’s entrepreneurs, that companies need to address a large market from the start.In their eagerness to win, entrepreneurs ignore the lessons of history. Name a successful tech company. The overwhelming odds are it followed Moore’s advice.Facebook started with students at Ivy League universities. eBay focused first on collectibles. LinkedIn’s initial target was execs in Silicon Valley. Google’s early ads appealed to start-ups that couldn’t afford the minimum buy associated with banner ads. Amazon started with books. Each company added functionality and addressed a broader audience, but over time, not from the beginning.Over my long venture capital career, the biggest mistake I saw start-ups make was attempting to skip the early adopter stage to move directly into the early majority stage. After all, that’s by far the biggest chunk of the market and founders wanted to get big, fast. The problem is that reaching the early majority requires references. Without them they aren’t going to buy the startup’s product — no matter how compelling it is.Unfortunately these founders thought they were following the precedent of the successful companies they revered. What they didn’t realize is almost every successful company revises its history to make it more appealing to early and late majority prospects. Successful companies don’t lie about the past; they just try to protect consumers from unnecessary details that will get in the way of people buying their products. Consumers want to believe the product they’re buying has a broad appeal because that makes them feel more comfortable making an economic commitment to it.The only path I know of to success is to start with the early adopters who are desperate for your product and build references among them to address adjacent markets. When Wealthfront launched its automated investment service in December 2011, we faced a classic One of our investors suggested we initially focus on young people who work in technology because they would be more interested in the quality of our user experience than our assets under management. They also didn’t have an alternative to what we offered because our $5,000 account minimum stood in stark contrast to financial advisors’ typical $1 million minimum, which few could afford. That turned out to be amazing advice.We initially focused on Facebook employees because we thought they were the most likely to spread the word if well served and many were likely to come into money with the impending IPO, though not enough money to pique the interest of a financial advisor. We gave educational seminars to Facebook employees on how to invest well that never mentioned our service because we knew that would turn them off. Fortunately our early efforts, which we knew were not scalable, paid off handsomely. Our assets under management took off out of the gate.Once we had some traction with Facebook, we moved on to the next most social local company, LinkedIn. We focused on finding the biggest influencer who turned out to be Adam Nash, who is now our CEO. Early success at Facebook and LinkedIn caused word of our service to spread such that we were able to attract clients from many of the leading technology companies including Amazon, Apple, Dropbox, Google, Microsoft, Palantir, and Salesforce. Our narrow focus on Millennials caused our clients to invite their friends outside tech and in many cases their parents.After two and a half years we now manage more than $1 billion and less than 40% of our clients work in the technology business (although 60% are under 35). For context it took Charles Schwab six years to reach the same milestone and their growth rate accelerated once they achieved $1 billion under management. Breaking through $1 billion was likely the critical reference required for Schwab to cross the chasm into a much larger market.We’re convinced that following the lessons of To be a great entrepreneur, you must be non-consensus and right. Oddly, one of the bestselling business books of the last generation is now considered non-consensus advice. But as far as I can tell, Note: This post used a significant portion of an article I previously published on Inc.comCo-founder  Executive Chairman 

We’re having a pretty great year at But things weren’t always good.We’ve had lean times and made many, many mistakes. Most were the result of things I did (or didn’t do) and I’ve been keeping a list of my screwups.With that in mind, and as the new year approaches, I thought I’d share my list more publicly to serve as as a reminder to myself and as a public way for the team to keep me honest. For other entrepreneurs, I hope this list is useful, provides a laugh, or lets you see that you’re not the only one.As you’ll see, my screw-ups span all facets of building a company — everything from HR to culture to product to sales to operations to admin. I am what you might call “multi-talented.”So here they are in no particular order, bucketed by category. You’ll notice that some of these screw-ups sorta contradict each other. Yup — building a company is messy.This is my biggest learning by far as CB Insights scales. I thought if we just hired smart people, built cool stuff and made customers happy, culture would just I learned that it would, but it wouldn’t be the culture we want. Building the operating system of the company the way we want is something that must be actively worked on.As a step one, we’ve created a Culture Code doc. As new teammates join who’ve not seen the leaner times (crappy offices, product woes, etc), the culture code will serve as their guide on what is expected of them and what they can expect from the organization.Regular feedback (both ways) is important. I didn’t do this enough which results in people not knowing how they are doing or me getting feedback on how I’m doing. This type of feedback loop is important especially in a fast growing company where things can change frequently. This lack of feedback was one of the challenges I saw when I worked in a big company. I’d get an annual performance review, and they’d say “you need to work on X” and I’d think to myself, “why did you wait till year end to tell me this?”Trying to remedy this.We never had asystematic way for teammates to give feedback to each other (and to me). It can be hard to deliver tough messages in person, but if we want to really improve we need to facilitate a way to do this.Since we sit in an open floor plan, I kind of assumed everyone knew what was going on because they can hear me and others. The problem with my logic is that everyone too busy *actually working* to sit around and listen to me.So while people are aware of the tactical week-to-week stuff, the big picture stuff about There would be mornings when the biz dev would be doing a demo and see a whole new feature or improved interface on the product that they had no idea about before. This is not good.We just weren’t doing a great job of letting everyone know what others were working on. Knowing what others are working on is a good thing as it helps us do our jobs better. If our research team is doing content that our biz dev should know about for customers, that’s a good thing. If the research team is seeing a certain visualization take off, the product and dev teams should know about that. This exchange of information benefits everyone.We’d throw new teammates into the deep end. Setup your computer on your own, a nebulous project and ad hoc intros to the team. We’re scrappy, right? That goes with the territory.Wrong.Our “onboarding” process (it was generous to call it that) reminded me of this great HR joke I read on With the hard work of Jeneuse, Forrest and Harrison on the team, we’ve redone the onboarding process from top to bottom. It’s not perfect, but new teammates have a much better experience than folks used to. Thankfully.Organizations don’t go from being unsuccessful to magically successful over night. It is not binary — there are degrees of success over time. From my point of view as a founder / CEO, we are moderately successful today, but….we could be a lot more successful. With that said, it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t celebrate small wins and accomplishments *today*.Celebrating these doesn’t mean we’re less hungry or less focused on the end game. It’s just a nice way to recognize that we have momentum and ensure the team knows it.We provide a lunch stipend for the team, so everyone orders from Seamless for lunch. While I’ve seen more and more folks grabbing lunch together in the kitchen area, I think getting the team together for lunch more frequently would be a good thing. It becomes logistically challenging as we grow, but there’s value in getting the team all together and doing this while we still can.While we continue to prize resourcefulness, it’s not an excuse for providing half-baked directives and say “figure it out.” Getting better at fleshing out requirements for everyone is important as it will ultimately speed us up.This might be an effective strategy if you are Google with lots of big problems and where you can just find a home for smart folks, but at a growing company, this hasn’t worked for us. In the past, we’ve hired really smart people without clear roles for them in the hope of figuring it out as we went along.We don’t have the organizational structure or time to figure this out, and it’s not fair to these teammates either. Smart people want to actively manage their career and have aspirations for where they want to be. We tried to figure things out on the fly, which may sound appealing and exciting in the beginning, but it never worked for us or them.Every time I’ve cut corners to fill a role or hired because I felt that “we really need someone in this role” it never has ended well.I have agonized over these decisions — wasting time, getting aggravated and just not taking action. Beyond the time lost, the work we needed done was not getting done. In a big company, having a team of 30 with some folks not holding their own is fine, perhaps. In a young, fast growing tech company, it’s unacceptable. I should have made the hard decision quicker and moved on with life.I didn’t always think ahead about staffing needs as I should have. As a result, we ended up hiring too late, which meant that certain key areas weren’t covered as well as they should have been.I’ve talked to a few candidates over time who I really think might have been game changers. But I moved too slow or got bogged down on details and lost them.I tended to “fall in love” with new hires and think they’d come in and magically solve some intractable problem we had. The problem is my expectations/hopes were unrealistic and I often found myself disappointed. Now, I try to have more reasonable expectations. And sometimes, I get surprised which is amazing. But banking on the new hire messiah is something I no longer do.Skills change, personality doesn’t.There were times when I actually didn’t check references. What a royal F up. Never again.Besides not checking references, I didn’t know how to check them. I just used to do them as a formality to rubber stamp a decision we’d already made as a team. Now I ask hard questions during reference checks and have learned to read between the lines. General rule — if the references are not effusive, the person won’t get an offer.We hired remote workers before we’d really figured out our workflow and basic processes. It was a colossal failure. We may explore this again in the future, but we just tried it too early.We had a really good retention rate from the beginning, but as we picked up the pace of product development, it hurt us not to have someone actively working to ensure customers were aware of new features to help them be successful with the product.Assuming customers will figure out new capabilities is not a reasonable expectation of them. It’s not a customer’s job to figure out how we can be valuable to them. It’s our job to do that.The other powerful aspect to customer success has to do with the idea of negative churn. I highly recommend reading these posts by We tried to compete on the price front when we started and in retrospect, it was the wrong dimension to compete on. Now, because we price based on value, our pricing is up more than 10x, which helps us focus on the right types of customers and product capabilities to serve their needs.Below is a screenshot of an early version of our pricing page. Ever heard of a “Limo Plan”? Of course not.I think part of me thought people would just love this page and it would magically go viral or something like that. Ha ha. That was dumb.We are first and foremost a technology and product-driven company. If I ever had an extra minute in the day, I always gravitated towards doing product “stuff”. As a result, we spent a lot of time on product tinkering in the beginning instead of “getting out of the office” and selling CB Insights. My slowness in getting us selling has had bottom line impacts, in that we should have made a lot more money earlier than we did.I seemed to think that using terms like “best practices” or “synergy” or “socialize” made us sound more institutional and serious. In reality, it isn’t consistent with the tone and brand we want to build and to be honest, it made us sound robotic, douchey and boring.This has had a direct impact on our newsletter subscriptions. One of the reasons Of course, dropping jargon isn’t the only or primary reason for the growth of the newsletter (the data-driven content by our data science team is the main reason).I thought our initial inability to sell could be solved by signing up partners who’d sell and market for us. These deals took time to strike and never worked. If we can’t sell the product ourselves, thinking someone else could sell it was the epitome of stupid.We get between 100–200 trial signups per day on average. Many of them are in our target market and we used to waste time on every lead. This sounds so elementary in retrospect, but initially, we wanted to get everyone. The result of this with a small team was that we wasted time on bad leads and good leads sometimes went ignored.When we launched 4.5 years ago, we tried to have institutional pricing as well as pricing for startups. I was afraid to pick a market because “having options” seemed like a good idea. We quickly realized that picking a market gives us clarity in our messaging and approach, helping us to narrow our market a bit.For a long time, I actually These interactions take various forms. Sometimes, it’s a dinner like the one we hosted with 10 corporate If we signed on 5 new customers in a week but lost 1, I fixated on the loss. While churn is obviously an important lever in the growth of a SaaS company, my focus on the loss was counterproductive. I should have figured out with the team what we can do better in those cases and then move on. I should have also celebrated the victories we’d just had. Not getting excited about the wins is just not a good motivator for the team.I had never done sales before CB Insights. In the beginning, I thought sales had to be done in a certain sales-y, “sell ice to an eskimo” sort of way. That is not me. I’m an introverted guy by nature and trying to do this was a big giant fail. When I started “selling” by just highlighting my understanding of the client’s needs and challenging them to think of ways to do things better using us, things started to click.I’m not a natural salesperson nor had I ever really observed what really good salespeople do. So my view of sales was I give my pitch and the customer will or will not buy. What this meant was that in sales calls, I’d drone on and on oblivious to the client as my goal was to hit on my checklist of features.The results of this robotic, talking at sales process weren’t great.Then, I started talking to people who’d done sales before who shared a lot of insights with me. The biggest was about asking questions and making it a dialogue or conversation. When I started asking questions that helped me understand their pain points, the conversations were much better and the results improved.I’d have a great demo but would not follow up appropriately to ensure they were getting value out of their trial. This is a surefire way to have a sub-optimal close rate.I used to be hesitant to ask for the sale thinking it was somehow uncouth to do that. Again, this was foolish. By not asking for the sale, I dragged out eventual sales and also spent too much time on folks who had no chance of actually converting. Getting to no quickly is only 2nd best to getting a yes quickly. Dragging things on with a client is never useful or a good idea. Asking for the sale prevents this.Don’t give prospects a reason not to buy your product. I used to do this, and there is no good reason for it. Here’s an example from when I used to do this.I would demo Investor Search on CB Insights and at the end of demo’ing, I’d say something likeWe now have Rankings search on CB Insights to do this, but before we did, you couldn’t do it. That said, there was no point in me saying the above. Our investor search is a great tool, and I’d just shown the prospective customer something that only CB Insights can do. But I negated all that by telling them about something it couldn’t do. They might not have even cared about that capability, but I now planted a seed of doubt in their mind and probably made them wonder “What other things can’t CB Insights do?”There was no good reason to do this. Prospective customers are going to ask questions about whether the product will meet their needs. When they do, we should answer honestly about what is possible or not possible. But giving customers reasons to not buy the product was a very bad sales strategy.I spent a lot of time thinking about new channels to acquire customers without exploiting what we were already good at. Our data-driven research content was inconsistently published, as was our Once we realized this, we course corrected and now have a killer content / data science team of 6, which we’ll expand to 10–12 in 2015.If you think you could head up the group, Customers love getting cool swag. And our t-shirts are very cool, as modeled by the We get a lot of inbound messages from folks who want to integrate our data into their products or who want to white-label our product. 98% of the time these have been giant wastes of time. Generally, I’ve found that people who propose convoluted business relationship structures often (1) don’t have money and (2) don’t know what they want or are doing.I know now to pre-qualify these quickly and move on.This one sounds like a humble brag I know. But hear me out:We take a lot of pride in making hard things look easy because I wrongly thought the customers didn’t care how the sausage was made. But I’ve learned that they do. I’ve seen companies drop marketing buzzwords around Machine Learning and Big Data into their pitch and watched customers really get excited about those things.So while we don’t lead with the buzzwords, we’ve started talking more about our In addition, by not emphasizing our technology, we also were probably hurting our We get a fair amount of press, but there are lots of interesting trends and insights about companies and investors we see pretty early. We should be proactively reaching out to the media with ideas, rather than waiting until they inquire.Not all feedback is created equal. Feedback from existing customers or credible prospective customers is worth a lot. As is advice from people who’ve done something similar to us, i.e. entrepreneurs who built or scaled SaaS or data companies. But taking advice from folks outside of those camps has generally proven to be a waste of time.I think Mark Cuban’s thoughts on this are sound:Chasing the flavor-of-the-month has always proven to be a waste of time. Remember when gamification and badges were the shit? I thought people wanted badges and gamification, so we worked on that. Wow, was I wrong.I read a line that startups fail more often of indigestion than starvation. There have been times when I’ve been distracted by new opportunities which were not worthwhile or just too small to be interesting. Eventually, when we’re massive, we’ll target all of those. But when we were a team of 10 or 15 or even 25, we needed to pick our battles and avoid the distractions.I’ve always been afraid of negative feedback. As a result, we spent too much time perfecting some key pieces of the product when we should have just shipped it. Reid Hoffman’s comment seems appropriate here:In the past 4.5 years we’ve had several companies, big and small, enter our space. They’re always more well-funded than us and usually they’ve had a lot more fanfare. I used to get fixated on what they were doing, but over time, I’ve seen nearly all ultimately die. What I’ve realized in all of these instances is that my “fascination” with these startups is driven by ego.Money doesn’t buy execution. We’ve gotten this far by focusing on customers — the people who pay us. I’ve stupidly forgotten this at times.I’ve made the mistake of fixating on what a competitor does and thought “oh, we should do that”. That has always gone poorly. Two things I’ve learned from these mishaps:1) When we’ve done stuff in response to competitors and not customers, it has never gone well. Customers pay us. I need to listen to them and remember the rest is noise.2) Our team has a much better view of where the market needs to go than our competitors. We should trust our instincts.We started in 125 sq ft and I think there is a weird part of me that likes the austerity of living humbly, but this went too far.Before we moved recently, our last office for a time had 18 people in 900 sq ft. The smells from everyone’s lunch were enough to drive you crazy. Being in such close quarters made collaboration among the team impossible, not to mention it was definitely not a great first impression for new hires.I manually wrote checks and did the withholdings and filings on my own for way too long. What a pain in the ass. We’ve moved over to ZenPayroll which has been great.Obvious sounding, but sometimes it’s harder to do than expected. Advisors of any kind (lawyers, accountants, PR, etc) often have a lot of knowledge about how things work and so when starting the business with one advisor, transitioning it to someone new may seem daunting.Because it is.What I’ve realized over time is that waiting to fire a bad advisor to avoid this transition pain is a bad idea. The problems that come from having a bad advisor pile up quickly and will cause you more headaches down the road than the short-term transition pain. Some of For a long time, I literally had 1 blazer. So if I was going to buttoned-up event or doing a TV appearance, I was always rocking the same blazer. It was kind of absurd. I’ve since added a few more to my closet, but I suppose I should dress better to “look the part”. One day.I did this a couple of times with the idea that we should support those that support us, and while it’s mostly worked fine, it does occasionally get messy when things don’t go well. In these instances, I should have done my diligence on them as a vendor as if they were not a customer and made my decision based on facts instead of just assuming they’d be a better vendor to us because of our pre-existing relationship with them.I have friends who are in our target customer demographic and have made the mistake of becoming directly involved in the sales process. As a result, I’ve found it better to have someone else on the team sell these subscriptions as it depersonalizes things and forces smarter, more business-like decisions for both them and us.As satisfying as you might think it may be, I’m here to tell you that responding to trolls is just never worth it. I now keep in mind the following adage:We started off with the name I get emails from folks to have coffee semi-regularly. I wasted a fair amount of time on these in the name of “networking”. I now push to have an agenda  objectives for the meeting so that it’s clear there is a reason to meet. While there is perhaps some “serendipity” lost by doing this, I’ve found that conversations with people who have a clear reason to meet are more productive for both of us.I quickly wised up on this after realizing these types of introductions are evil. I now only introduce people with a I took meetings with VCs who called us to talk about “how they can be helpful.” In the beginning, I thought when someone with money calls, you should take the conversation. The problem was that I wasn’t interested in raising money and as a result, I was not prepared for these meeting like I should have been. Unsurprisingly, I looked dumb and didn’t present CB Insights and our team the way they deserved.No matter how informal the conversation is, talking to investors requires putting on your game face. Not being into it, I shouldn’t have taken the conversation. It was a waste of time for both parties and took me away from what I needed to focus on — the product and our customers.If you’ve made it this far, congrats. I’ll be updating this post over time. Many more screw-ups to come I’m sure, but hopefully I’m learning and making new mistakes, and I hope the team will keep me honest.If there are other screw-ups you’ve seen in an emerging, fast-growing company that you’d like to share, leave them in the comments.

Over the last 3 months, our Some ideas were repeated so many times that it was clear they had to be captured (if you get drilled in the head enough times, you start to notice). Others come from mentors who are at the forefront of their fields and therefore seeing, imagining, and sharing ideas which haven’t fully come to light yet. The biggest takeaway of all…“Nearly all of the efforts to date have been focused on customer development, product and operations. From interviews to surveys and customer service calls, a ton of time has been spent simply understanding the customer and getting feedback. In Gagan’s words, “talk to your freakin customers”.Gagan noted that with previous companies he did not spend as much time talking to users and missed some core insights early, thus was not able to scale as quickly. He also strongly advises A/B testing everything.Marc Andreesen’s original post on In seeking to address this, It’s not how many people try the product, sign up, or even activate. Certainly these are important metrics, just not THE metric. Sean distills all of this down, and brings it back to asking the customer— if the product went away, would you be pissed? He also cautioned against confusing product market fit with a poor user experience.Square offers a great example of this:As does Rapportive:Both Square and Rapportive demonstrate a single point that matters which is clean, concise, and addresses exactly what the customer is trying to do, rather than what the product does.It’s equally important to know what Listen to the language your customers use to explain your product. When you’re at an event and someone makes an introduction, pay attention to how they explain what your business does. This is gold. The insight can be invaluable to craft and test your improved brand message.These are just a few of the high level concepts that came up repeatedly and I’ll be sharing more over the next few posts.

Are you competing with well funded competition with a zero dollar marketing budget? So am I with There’s a ton of people asking questions on Quora, which you can answer if there’s a way in which you can promote your startup without looking like an asshole.If you have far more time on your hands, and a lot of friends, you could even try getting them to ask questions like “What is the best software to do Y” and answer their questions to get some traction going.If you can’t write and you expect to work wonders with a zero dollar marketing budget, I’m sorry but you’re running out of luck.The key to getting SEO and other such stuff working nowadays is to keep creating consistent content that’ll help you rank better.So can unanswered questions on Quora:But, at the end of the day, Do you have a way in which you can promote your product without looking like a Scrapebox spammer? Great!If you’re unsure about this, read The general theory is that if you already have established influencer blogs in your industry, you’d much rather go write for them initially to get more reach until you build your customer base.Forums are a great place to find folks who are influencers in your industry as well as reach out to an audience at relative scale without having to invest a lot of time in creating content.I’m quite certain that for any industry you’re going after, there’s at least a forum or two which are active that you can discuss in. Write insightful responses to questions and make sure you have a link to your product set on your forum signature.Google+ is mostly an echo chamber, unless you’re a marketer. There are some communities in G+ that do have activity and it may make sense to just participate in them and respond back to threads.Find a small problem worth solving in your industry and build a free tool to do that.

They are already spending millions of dollars on promoting themselves and prospective buyers are going to research them online before buying. If you’re there as a viable alternative when they’re looking = $$$$Your well-funded competition has a gazillion users. These gazillion users need guides about how to use their bloatware. {insert random well funded co here} doesn’t care much about that in most cases, since they’re too busy spending the check they got from their VC.There’s demand — why not be the supply?

While some designers are fundamentally more qualified than others, interviews can completely change a team’s perception about a candidate. Sometimes a designer we were lukewarm on crushed it and we immediately wanted them to join, while other times a dream candidate blew it and we’d leave their presentation bewildered.Looking back, some informed preparation could have gone a long way toward helping candidates put their best foot forward. If you’re about to go in for an interview at your dream startup I highly recommend doing the following:Co-Director at Designer Fund, helping designers build companies with meaningful impact.

Website: Snip.ly is a link shortener that drives conversion. It lets you embed messages into every page you share across social media. Here’s an example of my Snip.ly message on Y Combinator’s home page: snip.ly/dBy. It works like a link shortener, but allows you to embed into the page your own call to action, commentary, announcements, and pretty much anything you want. You can promote yourself while sharing articles from TechCrunch, Forbes, Mashable, etc. Every shared link is a lost opportunity if you’re not using Snip.ly.Sharing is huge. Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn Newsfeeds are filled with content people are constantly sharing. Yet few share for the sake of sharing. People share to build thought leadership, an audience, and a following, so they can ultimately push their own brand, their messaging, campaigns, and Call to Actions. Sharing is meaningless without conversion. We built Snip.ly as a link shortener that drives conversion, by allowing people to embed their own Call to Actions into the pages they share, extending their brand into shared content and driving conversion. We know people need what we’re making because we can see hundreds of snip.ly links being shared everyday. Check out this real-time twitter stream: Currently, people primarily use Bit.ly for link shortening. However, Bit.ly serves absolutely no purpose other than simply shortening the link. It does not drive conversion, it does not extend your brand, it does not include your call to action, it just offers extra characters in your tweet. After sitting on the front page of Hacker News with a ton of comments from the community, no one has pointed out any substitutes or similar services, which leads us to believe we’ve built something that doesn’t exist yet. Also, the fact that we were voted to the top showed us that not only is it new, it’s something that people want. We saw the same results on Reddit and Product Hunt.Link shortening is the vehicle of which we use to deliver our value proposition, which makes Bit.ly one of our competitors, since they’re integrated natively into many platforms. To counter that, we built a browser plugin that integrates Snip.ly everywhere for our users. Another potential threat would be social sharing dashboards such as HootSuite and Buffer, both of which could integrate our functionality. However, it’s safe to say that their value propositions are sufficiently different. HootSuite focuses on managing social media relationships across multiple accounts, and Buffer focuses on enabling consistent sharing activities. On the other hand, our value proposition is driving conversion through sharing.What we understand is that sharing is all about conversion. It’s not just about sharing more consistently (Buffer), it’s not just about managing relationships (HootSuite), it’s not just about having more characters in your tweet (Bit.ly), sharing is meaningless without conversion. It is the underlying motivation behind sharing, and we get that. We also get that the closer we are to the true motivation, the more valuable our product is, and the more likely our users are willing to pay for the service.We believe that when you help people make money, it’s easy to make money. Snip.ly generates a clear ROI since we drive traffic directly to the users’ Call to Action. We plan on introducing a performance-based subscription model, for example, free for up to 100 CTA clicks/mo, $10/mo for 1000 CTA clicks/mo, etc. We could also charge premium for customization features such as custom positions, sizes, colors, fonts, etc.Snip.ly is inherently viral. Every Snip.ly link that is shared serves as promotion for us since we have our logo on every Snip. The people who use snip.ly are influencers, people who actively strive to build a following, so our reach grows exponentially over time with each user we acquire. Many who follow influencers tend to have a following of their own, so the viral cycle keeps rolling. We don’t face the chicken-and-egg problem since Snip.ly is a tool that rides on natural sharing behaviors and existing networks.Cofounder 

One of the companies sponsoring the conference I attended last week was passing out ‘The Wallet Ninja is a credit card sized piece of metal that has 18 functions including: A bottle opener, a can opener, multiple screw drivers, a cell phone stand (huh?), a box opener, and a ruler.I’m sure that whichever company sponsored this had good intentions, but I wouldn’t be surprised to find that a few people ended up slicing their fingers off when trying to open a beer. It doesn’t do much better any of the other 17 functions.You know what opens a bottle It’s not sexy, but it’s the best tool for the job. I’d rather have one of these than a Wallet Ninja.Startups often make the mistake of trying to be everything to everyone because they are desperate to show any traction at all. The salesperson calls the customer to pitch A. The customer doesn’t need A, but really needs B. B is only tangentially related to A, but you rationalize that it’s only code so the team will build B to make the sale to the customer.This becomes a slippery slope. The next customer wants C and D so of course you’ll build that. The team gets to work and does only a half-assed job building out B, C, and D because they still haven’t even finished building out A. Your customers aren’t stupid and the lack of effort shows. You end up with a bunch of mediocre products that no one will ever use.And what about A? You know, the product you gave up your career to build because you were so passionate about it. All that time you could have spent refining it or selling A got spent building B, C, and D. Product A ends up just as half-assed as B, C, and D. You rationalized that you can get back to making it better when B, C, and D are rolled out but then there will be E, F, and G.Having the discipline to say no to these kind of requests from potential customers is one of the single hardest parts about building a startup. It’s completely different from corporate life where profit margins allow for a lot more room for experimentation and failure.All the great startups of the past few years have become successful because they first focused on being the great at one thing. Dropbox syncs all your files, Uber gets you from A to B, Github hosts your source code. These business are all much more complicated now, but they started off with solving one problem incredibly well.You should aim to do the same with your startup. Do one thing really well that your customers absolutely love and make it the best product it can be. In other words, your company’s product should be the bottle opener and not the Wallet Ninja.Founder, CEO of Direct Match. We’re building a better fixed income market.

Well, it’s not supposed to be. News is when so-and-so raised a $15 million round from Sequoia-this or Andreessen-that.Yesterday, we had an interview with Y-Combinator for our video startup, A little embarrassing to admit, but I’d already started writing my self-congratulatory Facebook status in my head. “So excited to announce that 100 has been accepted into the next batch of Y-Combinator,” I’d say.Then at 8pm: we got our rejection email.Ugh.Here’s the Facebook status that went out instead:Then a cool thing started happening. One by one, people left comments about how they’d failed before. Joel Gascoigne from Overall, Silicon Valley is pretty good about embracing failure. Here, it’s not taboo to say you started a business and it failed. I don’t know anywhere else like that.But that’s easy to forget when we see shiny headlines on TechCrunch. We’re only seeing a brief moment of glory. We don’t see the self doubt, the lost sleep. The dozens — sometimes hundreds — of rejections from investors.We’re good at embracing failure — but we could be better. Do the scarier thing. When we stop hiding our failure, we stop fearing it.I make viral videos and explainer videos for startups. 

Two weeks ago, I accepted a full-time offer to join My previous startup still exists. My co-founder is at the helm, we’re generating revenue, and our customers continue to tell us they love the product. The story of why I left is one for another day, but after co-founding two companies, here is what I’ve learned—and why I’m joining a team now to build out someone else’s vision instead of one of my own for the next step in my career.I have learned so much in the last two years—about starting a company, about fundraising, about building and selling a product. It’s what happens when you are one of two people working on getting something off the ground: you do anything and everything you can think of that needs to be done. And if something needs to be done that you don’t already know how to do, you learn/Google it. (Google is the source of most of my programming knowledge.)It was great. I loved doing something different every day, sometimes every few hours. But I realized something. I would never be great at any of those things individually if I were to devote equal time and attention to all of them.Actually, the big epiphany was that I realized I didn’t What I really want—right now—is to be really, really, really good at one thing. I think that makes sense for where I am in my career.And I want to be really, really, really good at product design.When I first left marketing to enter the startup world, I thought it was mainly because I wanted to start my own company. And part of why I wanted to start my own company, I’ll admit, was that it seemed glamorous. The promise of a big payout. Of fame. The power and flexibility of being my own boss.Not that I don’t still want all of those things. But I realize now how low the chances are of a runaway startup success. I think I’ve also grown up a little, so my motivations have become more nuanced: I’d love a big payout event—not so much for the sake of being rich but for the freedom to work on whatever I want. The fame—not so much for recognition as for the platform it’d give me to find support for the causes, projects, endeavors I care about. And the flexibility of being my own boss—well, because it is (and I’m sure always will be) awesome to work in pajamas.But, underlying all of those things was a more visceral, and more important, reason.More than anything else I want from my career, I want to make things.And it turns out I don’t need to start my own company to do that.Fortunately for me. Because—guess what?And selling can be terrifying.You would think that the best people to sell an idea, a product, a vision are the people who came up with it. Right? Well. Yes, that’s probably true.But if you’ve ever written something, painted something, drew something—Selling your company (to investors, to customers, to employees, to the press) is like promoting any other kind of artistic endeavor. It requires the same kind of vulnerability. It requires you to let someone see you bleed. To expose all of your creative, strategic, intellectual decisions—to invite people to sit in judgment of the vision you have for the world.I’m better at sharing my writing than I was before. And I’m better at selling ideas, products, dreams that I believe in than I was before. But right now, The challenge I am craving: building and scaling a disruptive product that poses incredibly complex interaction design problems.In short, I want to focus on making things.designer + entrepreneur + obsessive list maker. currently heading up design My year of writing every week.

The co-founder of Blendle here, the startup from The Netherlands you mention in in your piece. We heard the same arguments many times in Holland before we started. The complaints totally disappeared in my country, after people really started using the site.If you look at the idea of Blendle, I admit, it sounds pretty bad. Having to deal with paying for every article just sounds pretty horrible. Especially in times of Spotify. The thing is: Blendle is not about the idea. Or even the model of micro payments. It’s about the execution: offering completely frictionless micro payments combined with excellent discoverability of articles that are interesting to you, combined with the full scope of quality journalism. Our users seem to like it. I guess you have to use it to fully appreciate it (although I would understand it if your Dutch is a bit rusty. I admit it’s not the most beautiful language in the world. It actually sounds like the noise of a coffee grinder when you hear Dutch people talk).You make it sound like a bad thing that one out of every five registered users start topping up their accounts with real money. To me, that’s pretty awesome. Especially because our users are quite young: 2/3 of Facebook-registrations is under the age of 35. And those users, tens of thousands of them after just 10 months (with zero euros spent on marketing), are paying for journalism like it’s the most normal thing in the world. I know — quite strange.What we have proven in the Netherlands is that we generate a very decent amount of money (I can’t say how much, unfortunately) after only ten months. But more importantly: it’s money from people who weren’t paying for journalism before. My friends have never paid for music and movies, until Spotify and Netflix. And with Blendle, they’re paying for journalism, often for the first time in their lives.We’re trying something new. In The Netherlands it’s working. And we’re going to try in other places soon, because of great enthusiasm from a lot of publishers (also in your own country).For people of all languages, it’s great to discover fine articles, and be able to pay for them with one click, from one wallet, and always know that you can refund if you didn’t like it.Blendle was lucky enough to be featured in a lot of newspapers and magazines around the world the last couple of months. Hence, I am checking Twitter a lot. Following links to The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal and all kinds of websites in different languages, I bumped upon paywall upon paywall. Again and again it asked me to register before I could read more than two lines. Paywalls are annoying. Journalism should have an awesome user experience, also for non-avid readers of specific newspapers and magazines. We’re trying to fix that. I’m sure we can do much better, and we will. But our month-to-month growth and the average age of our users makes me pretty optimistic already.Co-founder of Blendle

The original plan was an autonomous lawnmower.When co-founders Jorge Heraud and Lee Redden first pitched this idea in front of Steve Blank’s Launchpad class at Stanford, Blank was sitting in the back, quietly laughing to himself.“We knew that no one was going to spend tens-of-thousands of dollars to automate one person’s job,” Blank says, “It was a bad idea, but we couldn’t tell them that. They had to learn that on their own.”Thankfully, learning that your initial idea is terrible was in many ways the point.Over 10 weeks, Blank’s class — which Blank teaches at both Stanford and Berkeley — walks its students through a practical implementation of his famous lean methodology.Roughly, this means students:The early stage of this process involves building a “Business Model Canvas.”On a “Business Model Canvas” you draw a large grid and list out every single core assumption you’re making about your product and the market you’re going to sell it to.What are you going to be selling? To whom, exactly? What is your value proposition for them? Why would they buy it? Who would be the key partners? What about vendors and suppliers?On their original canvas, Jorge, Lee, and the rest of team defined a handful of potential market segments that might be interested in a lawnmower that drives itself.They came up with golf courses, football stadiums, parks and recreation departments, and consumers.After building out your Business Model Canvas, the next step is “customer development.” This means talking to potential customers in depth to uncover their most urgent business problems and whether or not they like your proposed solution.Blue River’s team was cautiously excited and optimistic when they reached out to their network and went out into the world with their autonomous lawnmower idea.Fortunately, Lee and Jorge are smart guys. They learned pretty fast.As Lee says, “We went through and interviewed customers in each one of our target segments. Almost everyone immediately said ‘we do not want this product. This is not a good business.’ It was a resounding no.”The first major benefit of lean development had just demonstrated itself: Jorge and Lee discovered that their autonomous lawnmower idea was a bad one before diving headfirst into product development and crashing hard into a market that didn’t exist.The second major benefit of lean development was just around the corner.One positive side effect of doing customer development is that it puts you in front of a lot of different, well-placed people. If you ask the right questions to these people and listen carefully, you might learn something you didn’t already know.As part of their customer development process, Jorge and Lee crossed paths with some big farmers and agribusiness execs.Like everyone else they talked to about autonomous lawnmowers, this group was universally unimpressed with the idea.As Jorge puts it:But this same exec was happy to talk about his business problems, and he happened to manage automation for a multi-billion dollar agriculture business.“But,” the he said, “I do have this huge problem with weeds.”At this moment, Jorge and Lee leaned it.Suddenly, as an almost-random byproduct of customer development, the two men had uncovered an expensive, painful problem.They started digging.Jorge and Lee took a trip down to a big organic carrot farm and watched the weeding process, themselves.Both men were moved by what they saw.Lee, who grew up in a family of large-scale corn and soybean farmers, says:As Lee and Jorge talked to more carrot growers and other large agribusinesses, they discovered that weeds (and the process of removing them) are among the biggest problems these businesses had.Jorge says:Indeed, as many large tomato farmers in Alabama learned the hard way, when government policies suddenly get aggressively hostile to undocumented labor, you can lose an entire season’s crops.So now Jorge and Lee had, through extensive customer development, stumbled across a big, painful problem for organic carrot farmers.They excitedly presented what they’d learned to Steve Blank’s class.Blank says that when Jorge and Lee and their team presented their findings, Blank told them (in front of everybody) that the were collectively headed for a “B” grade.The team was stunned. Offended, even.Weren’t they excelling at the doing the things Blank suggested? Wasn’t their conceptual pivot proof that they’d been implementing the lean framework to perfection?But, Steve said, “Where’s the MVP?”According to Steve, this interaction lit a fire under the team. Jorge says he doesn’t remember it at all. One way or another, a prototype got built.Lee remembers this as a very long week.You sometimes hear of a couple of smart software hackers taking a week to throw together a prototype piece of software. It’s more unusual to hear about some smart roboticists taking a week to build a prototype robot.This prototype robot came with two cameras, two different lasers, and a working lidar. They named it “CarrotBot.”When Jorge and Lee got to Southern California and rolled the CarrotBot out of the truck, the agriculture exec was impressed.By week six of Steve Blank’s 10-week class, Jorge and Lee had completely ditched the autonomous lawn mowing idea. They had met with a range of agriculture executives and independent farmers, built CarrotBot, and reoriented their team towards applying robotics to solve problems in agriculture.But the journey to Blue River’s first commercial product was just beginning.“Our initial focus was on organic carrots,” Lee says, “but over the next few months, we kept pivoting. We looked at tomatoes and lettuce and broccoli. We talked to people that made organic fertilizers. We even met with a smaller farmer who grew onions and shallots and actually started work on a robot that could detect shallots at one point.”Eventually, as they developed and tested hypotheses about which markets to enter and which products those markets would need, Jorge and Lee honed in on the problems facing conventional lettuce growers:Jorge says:As much as the team liked the mission of organic crops, they also recognized that as an initial market, it was too small to go after.“Only about 5–10% of all carrots grown are organic,” Jorge says, “and carrots in general are a relatively small scale vegetable, in terms of acres dedicated to growing them.”Meanwhile, there are five big agriculture companies that, between them, control 50% of the entire US lettuce crop.“Lettuce looked like a great market,” Jorge says. “To have major impact, we didn’t have to go after 100 different customers. We could close five and address 50% of the market.”And, as Jorge and Lee soon learned, every single one of the players in the lettuce market has a major problem.The problem every large-scale lettuce farmer faces revolves around something called “thinning.”In case you’re unfamiliar with gardening or crop management, thinning is the process of pruning away excess growth to let the stronger growth thrive. In lettuce-specific terms, thinning means clearing away the heads of lettuce that threaten to impede the growth of more promising heads of lettuce.Like weeding carrots, lettuce thinning is back-breaking work and all of it is done by undocumented migrant labor.On average, an acre of lettuce yields $1,000 of revenue for the grower. The labor required to thin the lettuce costs anywhere from $100–200/acre. Do the math, and that means 10–20% of your profits go to paying rock-bottom wages for migrant workers to do back-breaking work all day in the sun.Now, Jorge and Lee figured, Jorge and Lee started visiting the largest lettuce producers and sharing their idea for a robot that would automate lettuce thinning.The lettuce execs basically jumped out of their seats.“They told us everything we wanted to know about thinning,” Jorge says. “We learned what makes a good thinning vs a bad thinning and what a perfect thinning process would look like. We quickly became very good at figuring out what needed to be done to build the ideal machine.”It took about three months of pivots to go from autonomous lawn mowing to thinning lettuce, but the team’s marketable idea had arrived.They would take the best discoveries in computer vision and machine learning and offer a breakthrough robotics product to large-scale lettuce growers. They would start a company, and it would become Blue River.Blue River’s robot would use cameras, computer vision and machine learning to:The whole thing would have to happen in real-time as a tractor pulls the robot across the field at 2–3 miles-per-hour.More incredibly, the margin of error could only be quarter-inch. At 3 MPH, it’s a couple of milliseconds off and you’ve blown it.Before they wrote a line of production code or built the actual robot, Jorge and Lee went to the lettuce execs and made a presentation.They made the presentation as if the robot had already been built. They outlined what the robot could do, how it would work, how much money it would save, and how much labor risk it would eliminate.These robots would not be for sale. Instead, they told the execs, you’d pay a set fee per acre, and Blue River would bring their robots to your fields to handle the rest.Again, the lettuce execs basically jumped out of their seats. This time, they brought their checkbooks with them.Of course, once Jorge and Lee had the checks in hand, they had to go back and share the truth: the robots weren’t ready yet, but Blue River wouldn’t cash any checks until they were.By pre-selling a fully baked idea without building a fully baked product, Jorge and Lee had nearly eliminated their market risk.While the technology and execution risks still existed, the two men were confident they and their team had the necessary competence to overcome them.All they had to do was build a robot that did what they had promised.And so they did.With cashflow just waiting to come in, Blue River built a robot and the necessary machine vision and optimization algorithms to put it behind a tractor, pull it across a lettuce field, and thin acres and acres of lettuce at three miles an hour.The labor required went down from 10–20 people to one: the driver of the tractor. More remarkably, Blue River’s robots not only automate all of the previously manual labor, they actually increase crop yields by 10%.Jorge, Lee, and team are now shipping their third-generation lettuce-thinning robot, and the bigger, badder, faster fourth generation is already moving through the pipeline.In going from an idea for an autonomous lawnmower to building a lettuce-thinning robot, Jorge, Lee and Blue River’s team practiced Steve Blank’s lean methodology top-to-bottom.The results have been great.As Blue River prepares its next product line, they are going through the process again, mapping their assumptions on a canvas, testing hypotheses on potential customers, and learning and pivoting the product idea as they go.Though a lot of startups aspire to be “lean,” not a lot of them actually have the discipline, patience, and focus to do it right. The temptation to just build and launch something lightweight is strong and hard to resist.But as the example of Blue River shows, it’s not only possible for startups to bring profitable hardcore technology products to market, there’s a way to do it that dramatically reduces your market risk.The keys, it seems, are a relentless ability to question your own assumptions, a willingness to throw the wrong ones away, and the resourcefulness to capitalize on it when the right idea shows up.If you’ve got big ideas and real technical chops, these keys are in your hands.Bemused observer.

While many angels and VCs are still skittish about hardware startups, there has been a massive renaissance in the hardware funding ecosystem over the last few years. Since 2010, venture capital investment in hardware startups is up more than 30x:With this explosion in hardware funding, one of the questions we get all the time is, “who else is investing in hardware?” We generally think about private hardware investors in three buckets:The number of funded connected hardware startups in the Bay Area (who have publicly raised $1M or more) currently sits around 110 by my count. Boston and NYC (which are about equal) are one-third of that. Los Angeles and Boulder/Denver are one-third again of Boston and NYC. By aggregate dollars raised, however, SF completely dominates. It was almost 5x Boston in 2014 and over 10x NYC and Boulder. Everywhere else (including internationally) is a rounding error with a few very notable exceptions (Xiaomi, DJI, and Magic Leap, in particular).Three main dynamics have been driving private investors to seek hardware companies:A few breakout companies have paved the way in proving that hardware companies can be tremendously profitable. Distribution and manufacturing are still hard, but GoPro and Fitbit have shown that hardware can While traditional hardware companies have few feedback loops besides revenue and returns, connected hardware startups get constant feedback on product usage, retention, and churn. This speeds up iteration cycles and helps investors (who are already comfortable with SAAS) understand younger hardware companies without as much sales traction.Most hardware products struggle with commoditization and low margins over time. Today’s connected hardware products are often a trojan horse for software. Software that is harder to replicate, can increase switching costs and provide more opportunities to interact with customers and build brand. The upshot is a higher customer lifetime value either through recurring revenue (While the past few years have been banner years for venture capital investment, the connected hardware ecosystem has seen particularly explosive growth in both the number of startups and the receptiveness of VCs to funding them. This is driven by decreased development costs, shorter time to market, and a 2015 is on track to surpass 2014 in both number of funding rounds and aggregate investment although growth is leveling off as a number of hardware categories become saturated and the ecosystem figures out who the winners are.

When I was a graduate student, I caught the entrepreneurial bug. I joined forces with a couple of talented classmates, and with one of LinkedIn’s co-founders, to build a social networking startup on top of LinkedIn. We embarked on the journey after LinkedIn released its API in late 2009.Unfortunately, we failed miserably (12 months later). “Platform” risk is lethal indeed. Okay, I kid … It was an amazing experience with a lot of lessons learned: 1) Building companies from scratch is hard. 2) Building with other super ambitious people is even harder. 3) I also learned how to use and love LinkedIn.Here’s how:LinkedIn is optimal for fielding a ton of interesting job opportunities, if you are a passive candidate.I got into VC because a close friend from Stanford received an InMail from my future boss re: VC job opportunities. My friend was moving back to Europe, hence he encouraged me to apply instead.Are you interested in joining the VC world? Then, connect with all the VCs you know on LinkedIn and make sure your LinkedIn is always up-to-date.2. Having lived in 5 cities and 4 countries; LinkedIn makes it easy to keep up with all my business contacts. As I network for a living, I’d need to have rooms full of business cards otherwise. And real estate is super expensive in Silicon Valley. :)In addition, I use LinkedIn a lot when I scout for new investment opportunities; just type “founder” in the search box and you will see a list of prospects. LinkedIn also saves a ton of time when I want to get hold of founders I want to meet.For example …Evan Spiegel from Snapchat was a senior at Stanford, when he was kind enough to accept my InMail and offered to meet. My employer, General Catalyst Partners invested in Evan’s company a few months later.Brooks Buffington from Yik Yak also accepted my InMail and sent me an email to connect.A few weeks later I invested in the company’s seed round.After we/I invest, LinkedIn continues to make us look good in front of our founders; as I can easily mine my network for talent and business development opportunities on their behalf.3. The founder/CEO of Raise.com cold-emailed me on LinkedIn as he wanted to discuss about his business when they were getting started.I feel super fortunate to have met George Bousis early on in his journey of building Raise.com to a multi-billion dollar company. Ever since, I always read all the cold-emails I receive.Do you want amazing people to reach out to you on LinkedIn? Then consider sharing your thoughts/ideas with your network frequently or be active in LinkedIn groups.4.CRV Partner George Zachary and I launched SV Greeks  Greek Americans together. We wanted to help all the Greek geeks network and build bridges to Greece.The homepage of our 1500+ member strong community (and most Greeks in tech) is our LinkedIn group.5.This is the case not only on Instagram, but on LinkedIn as well.With the sophisticated analytics tools, you can track your LinkedIn vanity metrics very closely. Sometimes too closely; more often than checking your email.Outside work, LinkedIn will always have a special place in my heart. In 2011, my future significant other sent me a message informing me she would attend an event I was co-hosting.Perhaps, LinkedIn should consider getting into the online dating space, if it ever runs out of steam as a professional networking community?A version of this post originally appeared on LinkedIn.Early Stage VC | Entrepreneur at heart. 

In the early-stages of startup life, it’s easy for design to seem like a luxury reserved for the handful of accomplished companies that have the time and money to pay for it. But design is arguably more critical to startups in the earliest stages of operation than it is for established market-leaders. If you’re not yet among the design believing, here are eight reasons we (You’ve heard it a thousand times by now, but it’s true; design is so much more than appearance. It’s what your product does, why it does it, how it does it, and who it does it for. When those things aren’t carefully considered (that is, Einstein is credited with saying that “A clever person solves a problem. A wise person avoids it.” Bad design is a nasty problem better avoided all together. Designing with purpose and intent from the beginning sets the stage for scale and success, and prevents a whole lot of painful rework.Design’s position as an essential business activity has come a long way since IDEO rolled it out to general audiences via aThe companies you want to be when you grow up — notably Google and Facebook — have acquired multiple creative agencies to bring design expertise in-house. Building a business without some capacity for design is quickly becoming an archaic practice, and one that you’ll eventually have to make up for.Since 2010, there’s been a dramatic increase in the number of startups founded or co-founded by designers — Airbnb, Simple, Mailbox, and Tumblr, to name a few of the more prominent examples.It’s increasingly likely that your startup is competing for investment, customers, and talent, with other startups who are using design to their strategic advantage.In his VCs have taken notice of the positive influence design has on startups — six other Silicon Valley firms added designers to their firms since Maeda’s appointment in January, 2014. When your startup begins the hunt for investment dollars, the odds are ever increasing that your audience will expect you to have a sound design strategy in place.VCs aren’t the only ones who expect to see design influencing your startup’s brand, products, and services. The general public has a taste and appetite for good design. Consumers aren’t satisfied with poorly designed products and they don’t have patience for inarticulate, uninspiring brands.If you’re operating in the enterprise space, you don’t get a pass on consumer-grade design. The days of compulsory business technology are gone and business-users demand the same kind of thoughtful, beautiful, well-designed products as consumers. Everyone’s favorite startup in 2015, Slack, exemplifies this new reality. Their focus on building a delightful product experience helped them infiltrated the enterprise from the ground up, converting individuals, then teams, then whole organizations to their communication platform.Innovation isn’t just about faster, smaller, more powerful technology, it’s about designing and delivering smart, delightful, and thoughtful experiences. Creative thinking circumvents “the way things have always been done,” and leads to whole new categories of business and product.Your brand and your product are indivisible, especially in the tech business. The best marketing and sales in the world won’t help you if your product is no good. And the best product in the world won’t get you far if the story you tell about it is uninspiring. You’re designing a business, its products and services, and the experiences your customers will have. There’s no such thing as Design Director at Studio ScienceFrom the Studio Science team

China is becoming more innovative than it used to be. Startup ideas which originated in China are moving to USA recently. Made-in-China is gradually transferring to Innovation-in-China. It’s expected that in a few years, the innovation power of China would surpass USA or Euro. How to prove this idea?

Sometimes you just get bored to spend you vacation in your home country and want to go out to see some thing different. Now we get jets and 4G connection, it seems like there should be no problem in foreign trip. But if you go to a country where you didn’t know the local language and have no idea about the local costumes, do you still want to explore that place? Brave guys choose to go, but to normal travelers, they just want rest themselves, finding a good place to relax. So is there anyone who can help them solve this problem? Here is Tripsters, Tripsters promised their users, that their question would be answered in less than 5 minutes. In a normal QA process, questions would be sent to students from China, ethnic Chinese or AirBnb owners. According to Tripster’s rules, if no one answered that question in five minutes, then Tripsters staff would come out to help him/her. Now Tripsters get more than 500 local people in its network.

Recent times have seen a surge of SaaS IPOs. In 2014 there were several high-profile floatations: Zendesk, Hubspot, New Relic, and Hortonworks. At the start of 2015, Box completed its initial public offering and raised $175 million in the process; its stock jumped 66% on the first day of trading.All of these companies owe their very existence to Salesforce.com, which paved the way for all Software-as-a-Service companies. I had the good fortune of joining Salesforce before its IPO in 2004; the company has since grown into a global powerhouse. The success of Salesforce ushered in an era of enterprise software based on a new business model — software delivered via the Internet and licensed on a subscription basis.The software industry has changed forever because of the vision of Marc Benioff and the other co-founders of Salesforce.com: Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez. Working alongside them will forever be a highlight in my career.Entrepreneurs today should study the tactics Salesforce used to transform from scrappy upstart into an industry bellwether. Salesforce became a great company — and was able to IPO — by applying the following 7 principles:You’ll observe many of these same traits in today’s successful SaaS companies.Although there’s no guarantee that your SaaS company will IPO, if you adhere to these 7 principles you’ll tilt the odds in your favor!To have a viable business, all of the following should hold true (and if they do, your startup has the potential to take-off like a rocket ship!):If you can succinctly state the value of your product, many things will follow. The market will easily understand what you have to offer. Your message will resonate with potential customers because they can easily comprehend and remember it. Providing a simple statement of your solution belies its technical complexity and puts customers at ease (while putting competitors on their back foot). You’ll also be able to market and sell your offering to your customers and to potential employees.The Salesforce product at the outset was strictly for Salesforce Automation (SFA), with aspirations to become a full-lifecycle Customer Relationship Management (CRM) suite. That’s a lot to comprehend for potential customers and employees alike.Simply stated, Benioff’s vision was to make Enterprise Software as simple to use as Amazon.com. As you can see, Salesforce closely resembled its inspiration (and incorporated a pithy phrase to describe its value to customers).Building a startup and scaling it into a lasting company is no small feat. To accomplish this, entrepreneurs need a team as passionate about the company as they are.In an A startup with the vision to change the world will attract missionaries who strive for a goal loftier than a large pay packet. Not all startups can provide this type of motivation to their employees; companies that do will assemble a team motivated by purpose rather than profits.Salesforce had a truly aspirational goal: In the face of this, Benioff extolled the virtues of “No Software.” He stated that companies should be able to rent software over the Internet, a proposition that was much cheaper than the hefty expense of an “on-premise” Enterprise Software purchase.Every entrepreneur wants a team fervent about the company mission. Truly great companies are those that instill passion and devotion among their employees.In the case of Salesforce, the cause was “The End Of Software” (as we knew it).A lasting relationship with customers is important for any business, but it’s absolutely critical for building a successful SaaS company. What might work in the offline world — focusing on a point-in-time transaction and not caring about usefulness and value to the customer — will not create a sustainable SaaS business. Think about the differences between traditional Enterprise Software and the SaaS business model.In the SaaS realm, a “sale” is just the beginning of a long-term relationship with the customer. SaaS providers should be attuned to the needs of their customers; if their service doesn’t provide value, the customer won’t renew (much less expand) the lease.SaaS providers are landlords, leasing access to functionality and data storage on their servers. Being a successful “landlord” (SaaS company) means having happy “tenants” (customers). Salesforce shared this apartment analogy on its website, in marketing campaigns, and at user conferences until the term “muti-tenant” became associated with SaaS. (We also filed many patents on our multi-tenant database architecture.)Benioff understood that SaaS required more than a traditional customer support team and defined a new role in the company: Customer Success Manager (CSM). Access to a CSM would be available to customers willing to invest in a higher-priced plan; in exchange, the CSM would analyze customers’ use of Salesforce and proactively suggest best practices. CSMs would frequently chat with customers and provide “quarterly scorecards” to highlight features or add-ons for the service.Salesforce also made a point of marketing the success of its customers. Posters emblazoned with images of actual users were placed in the Salesforce corridors; each person was labeled a “Hero” for their adoption of our SaaS. Salesforce even ran print and online ads touting these “Heroes.” Our customers became advocates for the product within their companies and at our user conferences.Promoting customers as heroes had a side-effect — it created a personal connection among our team. We all felt a duty to the people on those posters.We wanted them to keep smiling as a result of our software.You’re an entrepreneur building a SaaS business, and can succinctly state the value of your offering. Your team is motivated by the audacity of your vision and is dedicated to make it a reality. You understand that your startup needs to entice and retain customers (long-term “tenants”) of your service. Given all of this, the following advice will seem counterintuitive:Your customers may ask for something specific, but you should decide if it’s the right thing to build for their success (and yours).This example from the early days of Salesforce will illustrate. In the early-2000s, companies were not accustomed to having their corporate data outside of their possession. The idea of an application owned and operated by a 3rd party was anathema. Many potential customers (and investors!) of Salesforce insisted that Benioff provide an “on-premise” version in addition to a SaaS offering.It took the resolve of Marc, Parker, Dave, and Frank to stay true to their mission — to upend the software industry. They heard what their customers were asking for, but delivered something better. They refused to build an “on-premise” version of their product. And if they had, it would have prevented them from building a platform for SaaS applications.From 2004 thru 2008, Salesforce laid the groundwork of becoming an application platform. It should be noted that customers didn’t ask for Salesforce assembled the pieces of a platform, and convinced 3rd party developers to build features for the service. If you can replicate this model, you’ll (virtually) scale your product development team by several orders of magnitude!Build a platform that you know will provide value for the majority of your customers. Listen to their requests and use them to guide, but not dictate, your product roadmap.You want to ensure customer success and The death knell for a SaaS company rings when there’s a problem with customer retention. For a thriving SaaS business, you want to maintain “customers for life.” Your user base should accrue over time, ideally using more features of your service at higher price points as they become more sophisticated.Within 18 months of the Salesforce IPO, we had a trust problem. Our team, our software, and our databases grew in size and complexity. It became difficult for us to deliver features in a timely manner, with the quality that was required for enterprise software.The performance and uptime of our servers suffered. From December 2005 to February 2006, Salesforce experienced a series of serious outages. Critics argued that the limits of the SaaS delivery model had been reached. The viability of the company was in doubt. Our customers lost trust in us, and we lost trust in ourselves.In times of crisis, you prove your mettle.Salesforce co-founder Parker Harris responded to the outages by halting all new feature development. Our team focused on improving the performance and reliability of the service, a process that took months. In the midst of this, Salesforce launched a site called To this day you’ll see the following statement on the With a SaaS offering, you need to earn your customers’ trust through service reliability and full disclosure when systems are having issues. Like any other utility, your customers expect your service to be nearly always available.How do you get recognition and respect for your SaaS startup? The odds are stacked against you:To build a sustainable business, you must answer all these questions. You need to convince customers that SaaS is the best approach. You need to convince industry analysts and press that your startup is a disruptive force. You need to convince customers that your solution is as reliable as established offerings. And you need to convince To answer the remaining questions of From its earliest days, Benioff spoke of Salesforce as a viable alternative to Microsoft, Siebel Systems, Oracle and SAP. By associating his fledgling startup as a rival to these successful companies, Benioff controlled the conversation. It didn’t matter that all of those companies were far more established than Salesforce. By repeatedly comparing Salesforce to the industry giants, Benioff added a level of credibility to the company.Analysts and press began covering the scrappy SF startup that had the audacity to challenge the old guard. Salesforce was clearly the underdog, and Benioff took every opportunity to upstage his larger competitors.One early Salesforce ad campaign declared “The End of Software” and depicted a sleek fighter jet shooting down a red biplane; by implication the jet was Salesforce—and the biplane was Oracle.Salesforce also employed guerrilla-marketing tactics at a Siebel Systems user conference, staging a mock rally to protest “The End of Software.” The stunt was so convincing that it was covered on the evening news!Salesforce always provided a continuous stream of strategic press releases. These well-timed announcements kept Salesforce top-of-mind, and could be about a new client win, an industry partnership, or the steady growth rate of its customer base. Emphasizing growth is particularly savvy, because a startup will naturally have a higher growth rate than an established incumbent — by virtue of starting from a much smaller base!As a startup, you are an underdog in the industry. Embrace it as Salesforce did. It’s an effective way to make a name for your company; you have nothing to lose. And if large competitors react to your tactics, they will have done you a favor — by validating your message!A startup has several advantages over its competitors: it is nimbler, more Entrepreneurs are visionaries; they see a better future and are convinced they can make it come to fruition. This is certainly true at the The challenge for entrepreneurs is this: to continually think about their Benioff is a serial visionary. His ambition didn’t stop at the initial idea for the Salesforce product. Benioff was always thinking about the Each phase of the evolution of Salesforce was shaped by observing the developments of its direct competitors as well as companies in adjacent fields. Product strategy was informed by trends in mobile computing, social networking, and big data. Salesforce learned to acquire companies for core technologies that would advance its ambitions.Benioff regularly makes bold statements about the future of software, and challenges his team to turn these statements into reality. He’s also fond of the following saying:Think of what tomorrow could bring. Make a bold statement about what your company can achieve in 10 years.Then hop up on your surfboard. Ride the wave. And don’t forget your Hawaiian shirt. Aloha!SVP, Engineering 

Sometimes I just wish I had more time, there are so many more things we need to build and we are so early in the Internet. Today I need someone to provide a tool that will let me upload a flat file (comma delimited Excel spreadsheet) and turn it into a dead simple API that I can sell. The tool should automatically create a page for my API with docs, URIs, and let me write example API calls so my customers will know what to do.Make the API generation tool, and then take a revenue share on the usage based API calls. If the API calls are free then make it free and the startup gets nothing. Kind of like if you use Eventbrite for a free event and Eventbrite gets nothing. Handle payments via Stripe. Keep it really simple.I have an example case. Someone tweeted to me the other day that there really needs to be an API for the data inside S-1s (the filings that companies make with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to go public). Getting the data out of those documents is a bitch, but now that I’ve done it and I am maintaining a running spreadsheet I’d love to set access to it as an API.So if you have built something like this, or start hacking on it and want a test case, please CEO  Cofounder of 

Mobile, local, social! This was the mantra for startups looking to raise money in early 2011. Instagram was becoming a big deal, Foursquare mayorships were still fun and Snapchat didnt yet exist. Facebook’s mobile presence was an underperforming HTML5 app and only Google had figured out how to make money on the internet. Investors were willing to back ideas that offered the promise of being We did an excellent job of creating Amen had a feisty feel and some successful game mechanics. The feedback loop worked like this: I would post a polarizing statement, “We hoped to become the definitive guide for the best and worst of everything, but as our system grew a few unexpected things happened.First, it turned out that the most enjoyable lists often werent at all useful. For example, Second, we launched without a way to find lists that might be useful to you and we relied on our feed to distribute opinions. In retrospect these two decisions probably helped perpetuate less than useful opinions.Third, the useful lists we did have became rather generic after a lot of people had weighed in. For example, the top five Best Books Ever, according to everyone:Lastly, and most unexpected, we noticed that a core group of very active people were using Amen to ‘chat’ with one another rather than share opinions.What do you do if your most active users are doing something you didn’t intend and as a byproduct are filling your system with what you consider to be low-quality content? Do you build a product for them or do you cut them off? Much to their dismay, When we started Amen we told ourselves that we were going to win. None of this half way, sort-of-working, tedious slog that companies all around us were experiencing. No sir, we were going big, or else.It was a panicky feeling to find ourselves a year later neither winning nor losing. We had good retention numbers and in between the chatter funny and useful lists were emerging. It seemed We built comments for CherryLolliXO. We added a discover tab so that our globetrotting friends could find lists wherever they traveled. We introduced a text over photo feature and spent time improving profiles for reasons I can no longer remember. We hired a growth expert and spent several person-weeks A/B testing landing pages before eventually conceding that we needed to try something more radical.Our big idea hinged on structured data (Germany is a very ordered place, what can I say?). Amen was going to order the worlds information and be the first service to algorithmically understand how people felt. Our very first design cycles were spent perfecting a playful yet structured interface for posting opinions. Our feedback mechanics (upvoting and disagreeing by offering an alternative) were rich, collaborative interactions but more importantly they generated structured lists.As tied to structure as we were it’s surprising that we didnt invest more time to understand why people were drawn to lists. Did people need help making a decision about what to buy? Did people want to know what was trending among their friends in real time? Or, did people just enjoy the mindless exercise consuming ‘best of’ lists? We didnt know, so we kept hammering away at a solution that in the end seemed to not address any specific problem.One use case that worked well in our app was finding the best places nearby. Sharing opinions about places felt natural in our system and in hindsight it seems possible that Amen, rather than some combination of Yelp and Foursquare, could have become the app to open anytime you wanted to find the best local pizza option.Alternatively, we could have focused on providing product recommendations from your circle of friends, taking on Amazon’s recommendation engine for the best baby monitor, brake fluid or vacation novel.A harder pivot would have been to let go of structured data all together. People were having fun co-creating memes and building off each other’s humor. Why was this happening? Were the constraints around structured posting enabling this creativity? I wish we had dug into this further.Any one of these pivots would have required us to ditch a bunch of things we held dear, but in the end might have lead to a more understandable service and one that provided real value.Design manager at Facebook, part time painter.

Why do people do the things they do?In 1943 psychologist Abraham Maslow attempted to answer this question in his paper Maslow refined this theory until his death in 1970 and his final version breaks human needs into eight categories. There are four basic needs:Once these basic needs are met, there are four higher-order needs:According to Maslow, we’re only capable of focusing on the the next need in the hierarchy if our previous needs have been met.You don’t have to be psychology expert to recognize his theory in action. Think back to the last time you had a hard time paying attention to an important meeting or lecture that was right before lunch. You probably zoned out for a bit, salivating over the thought of biting into a toasty sandwich and washing it down with an ice-cold lemonade.When your basic physiological need for food has not been met, there’s no way you can meet your higher-order cognitive need for information.Maslow died in 1970, long before the creation of the World Wide Web. I’ll bet he had no idea that thousands of small companies would emerge to help people meet each of their major motivational needs.Lets look at examples of companies in each area, keeping in mind that the most interesting companies meet more than one motivational need. Over time, this will become a necessity.There is a large market here, because every single person needs these services. As a result, there is also heavy competition.These needs are generally easier for governments to provide, but companies help fill critical gaps.The coolest thing about the Internet is how drastically it has changed our ability to connect with people across the world. Social needs are no longer limited by our physical location.Self-confidence is a need that companies can only meet indirectly. You can directly sell someone food but you can only provide people with tools to foster their own self-confidence.It’s harder to meet higher-order needs until you have met basic needs. It follows that there are lots of companies focused on food delivery and social networking and relatively few companies focused on transcendence.Most basic needs are heavily saturated with startups but there is still room for growth. Two notable outliers with growth potential are Health  Wellness and Financial Security:It’s also humbling to remember that startups in all these areas are catering to the most fortunate segment of the population. Non-profit projects like It’s difficult to neatly bucket companies in this framework. Many companies already meet multiple needs. Over time, meeting multiple motivational needs will become a necessity.Three examples of companies that meet multiple needs are —Meeting multiple needs will become a necessity to differentiate. Luckily, its not difficult to do and often has positive externalities. Take Warby Parker’s model of buy a pair, give a pair glasses, for example. Could you apply it to food delivery? A company that donates a meal for every meal that you purchase is more compelling (and, in turn, defensible) than one that just delivers food.As it becomes easier to meet our biological  physiological and safety needs, we’ll be able to focus on self-actualization and transcendence.Right now, companies are just testing the waters around these areas. I predict that in the near future, we’ll see more companies emerge that are focused on helping people reach their full potential.Kickstarter is my favorite example of this. Anyone with an idea can reach thousands of like-minded people who can help that person reach their goals. Before the internet, this would not have been possible.This is exciting because it’s a new way that we’ll be applying science and technology to make people happier and more fulfilled.Hi! I’m Sameer.

You know it’s true…| Cofounder of Fittr. Illustrator of Tech Doodles. 1/3 of The Craft marketing newsletter. I love life and lemurs — and alliteration.Thoughts on tech and social norms that pop into my head and onto paper.

In Ben Horowitz’s words:If you’re thinking about starting a company, this post might help you get a better sense of what it really means, so you can see whether it’s what you want or not. If you’re already a startup founder, maybe this post will give you some comfort, knowing that you’re not alone in the struggle.OK, so everybody told you it’s hard. No one told you exactly These stories are not horror stories from failing startups. They are everyday moments of companies doing well, all around the world and across many industries. Even with good growth, a great team and helpful investors, there is always something going wrong somewhere. Your mind is constantly preoccupied and the feeling is unpleasant. Add to the mix high customer churn, slow growth, and less than 6 months of cash left, and you can understand why some founders just quit and never look back. If you wanted a job that would make you feel happy, this is not the one.But some things help. For starters, realizing that it’s hard for everyone makes it a bit less lonely. You see all those headlines of companies just crushing it, but you know what the founders are really going through. Facebook had serious cofounder issues early on, Slack’s first product never made it of beta, and you can bet that Uber’s execs aren’t too comfortable dealing with all those trials everywhere they go, yet those are the companies every startup is trying to emulate. They got their fair share of hardship, and so should you if you want to get where they are.The other good thing is that this hardship is where value comes from. As cliché as it sounds, nothing of value was ever created by just taking a walk in the park. Don’t jump to the wrong conclusion — it doesn’t mean that because you’re suffering, you must therefore be building something of value. The correct deduction is that if you’re not getting through hard times, then maybe you’re not trying hard enough to beat the average.Fortunately, most people are not trying hard enough to beat the average, and that’s how it becomes the average. Whatever market you’re in, for every minute you hold your ground and endure the pain, you’re getting closer to passing the “great filter” that stopped so many before you. “I can’t take it anymore”, they said, and that’s how rareness is created. Those who held long enough to pass the filter are the ones who built something of value, for the exact reason that so many stopped when it hurt. They are the ones who achieved greatness.Unveiling this connection between hardship and value doesn’t ease the pain, but in a way it makes me embrace it (in a non-masochistic way, of course). It means that hardship is the sign that I’m doing something non-trivial, and that helps.If this is not enough for you to feel better about the hard times you’re going through, it might mean that you’re keeping all the pressure to yourself. This is a big mistake. Sharing your problems with others can help you in many ways:Take the opposite direction: a brain, no matter how big, cannot solve a problem it does not know about. If you’ve assembled a team of brilliant people, you want them to use their brilliant minds to solve the problems. This transparency builds trust. As Ben Horowitz put it, “the required amount of communication is inversely proportional to the level of trust”. A CEO’s ability to build trust over time is often what separates well-executing companies from chaotic organizations.LEGO builder. Co-founder  CEO @ Front (frontapp.com)

Whiteboards are probably the most important piece of hardware a startup has. The whiteboard is where business plans are made, UI designs are sketched, and system architecture is plotted. It’s where a huge chunk of any company’s meaningful collaboration takes place.So I’m always surprised when startups have crummy old used-up whiteboard markers. You know the kind of marker I’m referring to: while not Hey, I know startups need to be careful with their money. That makes sense — in fact, it’s smart. But don’t scrimp on the markers! After all, you wouldn’t think of writing your company’s code on a New whiteboard markers cost about $1 each. New computers cost a heck of a lot more. So if you’re at a startup, and you have crummy whiteboard markers, splurge and Whiteboards are not as cheap as markers, but OK, I’m glad I got that off my chest.

You want quick and actionable tactics to get you traffic, subscribers, sign-ups and These are 7 of the exact same tactics I use for my SaaS clients when I’m setting up a content marketing campaign. They are some of the most effective tactics that I’ve used.Given that they are only “tactics” you should make sure that you are toning them to your Let’s jump right in, shall we?Create ebooks, worksheets, cheat sheets, templates, themes, interactive guides, or other valuable stuff that aligns with your customer’s core needs. Require an email sign-up to download or access them. Simple.AppSumo did this perfectly with their “AppSumo’s main target is their email subscriber list of over Think about that for a moment.When they have something new to promote they drop an email and have an influx of anywhere from 112,500 to 225,000 impressions. That’s This is how you build your subscriber list using guides.Otherwise known as “Blogging for business” but really just basic content marketing.What’s the difference between “targeted” blogging and “every-day” blogging? You have a This may sound a bit odd, so let me explain with an example.As a content marketing consultant if I wrote about content marketing on an industry blog it might get me some notoriety within the industry, which would be great — but it wouldn’t make me much money. What would make me money is writing about how to improve your marketing to a bunch of entrepreneurs, because some will want to know more. See what I mean? It’s a fine line difference.The goal here is to simply give value to your target audience where they are interested. Not just in what you offerIt’s rather simple — but if you don’t think enough about it consciously and define your voice, audience, and the story for that audience it won’t connect and Use data that is Like the “The goal here is social shares and inspiration through visual understanding. Also links, sweet, track-back links.In this case there really is no “embed this” but typically you would have an embed box with a link that pointed back to your original page that you posted the infographic to. This way every time someone embedded the infographic in their post it would link back to you. If it’s a well positioned and interesting infographic, this could mean thousands of links from hundreds of domains. That looks good on search engines, and simply gets you more referral traffic. This specific infographic-focused post has over Facilitate a I’ve The Y Combinator did this exact thing with Hacker News which was actually the inspiration behind inbound.org. The Y Combinator, being a seed accelerator gained a massive amount of notoriety in the hacker community just by simply giving them a medium to share interesting information with each-other. Simple up and down-voting functionality makes it completely user-generated and self-replicates their traffic.A community doesn’t have to be an up-and-down voting site either, it could be a number of things. It could be as simple as polarizing your audience as a visionary, as Steve Jobs did with his rebels.Basecamp has done a great job of this, building a cult-like following around their SaaS product while they were 37signals by writing a few books like Rework and Remote driven by their belief systems. Also they gained a massive amount of credibility by building “Rails” for the very involved Ruby community, while they were simply using it to build their own tool, Basecamp. 37signals already had quite a bit of notoriety in the web design field before building Basecamp, so their initial growth of the product was bolstered by their already established reputation and community.The key here is to build a following wherever it makes the most sense for you. Build a community for your company. With Bidsketch, their favored social channel and source of community is Twitter. They engage with their followers and have built a strong following by means of engagement and value. Buffer’s main community is their blog, where they wrap everyone in with incredible content, and then follow up with comments and engagements.Build where it makes sense for you.The fastest way to grow your audience is to adopt someone else’s.Build an API for your business that you can use to connect to others, and that businesses can license to integrate with you.Ruben Gamez, the founder of Bidsketch These are some key take-aways from what Bidsketch experienced while integrating with Salesforce, Basecamp, Harvest and FreshBooks:Here’s an example of Bidsketch’s landing page for their FreshBooks integration:Obviously powerful integration, and perfectly executed marketing. This is one of many reasons why integrations can be so influential, especially for early stage startups trying to establish notoriety. A well established brand can help your reputation tremendously.Building “referral programs” is a great way to get traffic from businesses in your vertical while also providing great value to your customers. If you can contact a business and offer to give a % off of your product to their customers if they do the same for you, you can create a basic affiliate relationship and acquire access to a potentially huge audience that would be directly interested in your services.This can be done on a B2B level or a B2C level.There are plenty more examples, but essentially the answer is to find benefits for your customers, and negotiate a deal with companies that could help your customers and could bring you customers.This is pretty costly, so if you’re just starting out this might be a tough pill to swallow. If you have some capital though, this is one of the best ways to spend it. Build tools that your customers will love and give it away for free. Either put a kick-back link to your site on the tool, or host it on your own sub-domain, then benefit from the amount of people using your free tool and discovering you in the process.Neil Patel from Quicksprout knows that people reading his blog want to learn how to improve their site, so he took it a step further and created an in-depth analyzer that will tell them exactly what they need to do to get quick results for their site immediately.

I was only 19 when I moved to Berlin to study Computer Science and International Management. My big dream was to start a global tech company that would have a lasting impact in Europe. Now, I am living my dream. With Wunderlist we are building an international product with a huge opportunity to transform the productivity market, both in personal life and business collaboration. It’s a long road to success, but I’m happy and grateful for where we are today and looking forward for all the things to come. I decided it’s time to share my learnings and encourage all of you to start your own adventures whether it’s in Europe or any other place in the world. The time has never been better to take action and start building the companies and products you want to exist.Here are 15 steps to launch your own startup:If you are dreaming about starting your own company, but you don’t know exactly what it is you want to do or if it’s even the right time, use your time to study. Starting a fast-growing tech business is incredibly challenging, and requires a variety of skills. The time you take to study allows you to explore your talents and find the one thing you really excel at.If you have a passion for design, programming or business — try to become incredibly skilled in one of those. The skillset of a founder often defines the focus and the culture of a company. At Wunderlist we are always looking for great individuals, that have a broad understanding of the things we are doing and share an entrepreneurial spirit. At the same time, we have a cultural guideline, that says “a Wunderkind is a master in something”. So, as an aspiring founder, invest your time and energy in identifying your talents and then follow your passion.Success is not dependent on your university degree. Still, if you choose your university wisely, you’ll gain much more than just factual knowledge. By attending the best university in the field of your talent you’ll have the opportunity to meet like minded people and build a great network amongst many other benefits.Don’t believe the myth of the college dropout who becomes a disruptive entrepreneur. There are plenty of examples where it doesn’t hold true. Early-stage investors look very careful at the education of founders and their years of industry experience. Be aware of this if you are thinking of starting your own company.The US has Germany is also a hub for the The bottom line: Building up a company, leading a team and sustaining a highly successful international business is hard work and requires a lot of knowledge. There are many ways to gain this knowledge. Depending on where you stand in your life, take the time and find a university that lets you find, explore and grow your personal dream. Ideally, you will even find your potential cofounders, right there on campus. Investing in your own knowledge and skills, means investing in your dream.Now that you’ve studied hard and really gotten deep into a particular discipline, it’s time to broaden your skill set. While it’s critical to become deeply skilled in one area of the business, the required skill-set to start and run a company is much more varied. Starting a tech business requires a strong sense for products, timing, trends and markets, which you can only acquire through experience.When I was 16 or so, I discovered a book called In order to be successful in life, it helps to understand the basics of successful leaders and successful companies. I’ve worked for different entrepreneurs, various startups and larger businesses as both an employee and partner. I did this by starting my own design and web agency right after I came to Berlin. We worked for all types of businesses for about three years.There were times of high profitability, but also times when we were close to bankruptcy. We didn’t earn much money, but it sufficed to pay our rent, food and universities degrees. In the end, this experience proved to be the foundation of starting our own tech company. The reason we learned so much was clear: When we started Having a period in my life dedicated to starting my own thing was critical. However, this doesn’t mean you should start your own agency. There are many alternatives to get similar experience. I would recommend you acquire experience at both a large and highly-profitable tech business and also a small, but fast-growing startup.Experiencing both types of businesses and the challenges they face will help you understand firsthand the reasons for their success. Learning how different businesses are structured, how they build their products, how management and leadership works is a long process. There is no way you can learn everything, but trying to understand most of it, is incredibly helpful in starting your own venture.As a founder, you will focus on finding the right idea and building your product. Defining company culture will be equally important for you. By working at different companies with varying missions and ways of doing things, you will learn what kind of company that you want to build. You will also know what skills you’ll need among your co-founders and first employees. Try to vary your experience even further by alternating between design, product, and sales-focused environments.If you’re looking for a startup job in Berlin, join the Facebook group Spending time with ambitious and like minded people shaped my own path. Most of my friends are developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and work for different kinds of startups. When you move to a new city, like I did, it can take some time to connect with other founders. Leo Widrich, one of the co-founders of Buffer, wrote a great, provocative piece about If you start an international tech business, you’ll be competing with intelligent, ambitious, and highly skilled people from all around the globe. It’s a huge challenge and having a great community of entrepreneurs, developers and designers for support is key.I’m lucky that Europe, and especially Berlin now has a strong and fast-growing community. But, when I first moved here, I didn’t know anyone from the startup scene or anything about related events. I had no clue how to go about meeting with founders or investors.To help aspiring entrepreneurs facing the same issues, I started a Facebook group called Besides connecting with founders, I would also recommend you identify potential mentors. These can be entrepreneurs who you think are doing a phenomenal job in building great companies. Surround yourself with them, learn from them. You’ll find out it’s easier than you think to get in touch with these people. It’s incredible how much you can learn from a single 30 minute meeting. I spent a lot of time in the beginning just reading about entrepreneurs and watching interviews on YouTube. I recommend you watch interviews on I follow many founders, CEOs, industry leaders, venture capitalists and other startups on Read blogs like When I started my first company in Berlin, I lived and worked in my apartment with one of my co-founders. There was no need for an office, we built our product right from our living room. The apartment was incredibly cheap, and we had such a fun time. We were living in The main hub for starting a tech business is currently San Francisco. It’s an amazing city, full of people working at tech businesses, and ready to start the next big thing. But, the challenges you will face there as a first-time entrepreneur are huge. The costs of living are incredibly high and you will compete with the world’s most successful tech businesses for talent. Then if you’re successful in finding them, you will spend more money for recruiting talented people than in any other city in the world. Jason Evanish wrote a great post about If you are a first-time entrepreneur, San Francisco is most likely not the best city for you to start your company. Luckily, San Francisco isn’t the only city in the world, there are other great places nowadays to start a business. New York, Tel Aviv, London, and Berlin are vibrant tech hubs too. Depending on your new business, location does matter. If you are an internet/software business, take care you pick a location that helps you to start. We chose Berlin based on the following:In Berlin, most startup are based in Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg and Kreuzberg. Try to rent an apartment in one of those districts. Or if you’re on a tight budget, Wedding is a great choice to find something affordable yet still central. Those districts are not only right at the epicentre of the community, but also very beautiful and lively.If you need an office to work, look out for co-working spaces, there are quite a few in Berlin: As founders we all have a ton of new product ideas, each and every day. Some of them sound promising, but only a few have the real potential to become a successful, fast-growing and highly profitable business.Before we started with Wunderlist, we had juggled a few different product and business ideas, but in the end we followed solving a problem we all shared: having one utility to organize both our personal life and business. We never used to-do apps before, but we sure used project management systems to organize our projects, and to coordinate work and communication with clients. We’ve tried many solutions, but were never satisfied. We quickly started building our own solutions, and realized, if we do this right, this could become its own business.Most of the project management tools we’ve used were highly profitable products, but equally hard-to-use, ugly and poorly integrated. Those were problems we thought we are able to fix, but there was an even bigger opportunity in this market — many didn’t see. Most project management systems are powerful solutions to organize projects of any kind, but they lack intuitive design, and what’s more complicated pricing and poor integration prevented people using them in their private lives. No one really used a project management solution at home, but there sure was a need.That’s where we saw our opportunity of inventing a utility that’s as simple as a to-do app, but as powerful as a project management tool. It also helped us to start lean and simple, and grow Wunderlist into something bigger. Wunderlist, as you know it, was our MVP, our simplest approach to solve a problem that’s huge — helping people to organize their private and business life. A simple solution, with the potential of serving hundreds of millions of happy users. Once we reached that proof point we were able to grow our product step by step to get closer to our vision.So, how do you actually pick the one idea, that has the chance to change the world?I believe it starts with the ability to identify your own problems, and think about clever and smart solutions. One big problem, can be solved by thousands simple solutions, it’s your job to find the best one. You need to become your biggest critics. Challenge every single idea with your team to the extreme. Be aware that most ideas that seem great in the first place, are either already taken or not so great once you’ve challenged them further. Try to play devil’s advocate. A great idea also doesn’t necessarily mean doing something entirely new. Sometimes it’s even better to just do something better. In our case, we took an entirely different approach to productivity software, without reinventing the wheel.We didn’t focus on productivity methodology, but rather on making productivity simple, human and fun to use. We also learned that it’s important to get a working prototype into the hands of people really early in order to get feedback. Being open to feedback is something you have to learn, but don’t listen to everyone. Learn to identify the nay-sayers and ignore them. Find people that give you honest and valuable feedback. Don’t wait for an idea everyone likes, because most likely it doesn’t exist. Kevin Systrom gave an As you can see, often it’s about identifying the problems, but also about finding clever ways to fix them. It’s a difficult and long process. There are certain methods that can help you to set up your process and processes that lead you to fast ideation and iteration. Make sure you check out When we’ve launched Wunderlist, Dropbox and Evernote have been two of fastest-growing cloud businesses world-wide. Both had a great traction, and demonstrated that it’s possible to scale a productivity app to a huge customer base. Both companies helped pushing the trend around the cloudBut when we’ve redefined the story to “to-dos in the cloud”, the reaction was quite different. We’ve explained how Dropbox and Evernote have invented a new type of market — a market that scales, and a market that’s profitable. There was a trend around cloud business, and now also around productivity apps. When you build your own business, try to understand what the trends currently are, and build a story around it. When I came to Berlin the trending topics were all ecommerce, communities and software-as-a-service, and it then became social, mobile and cloud. Trends can help you to get attention, but be cautious. Trends are temporary and your goal should be to build a company that lasts.As an entrepreneur you start a company with long-term goals. You want to create something that stays and adds value to people’s lives, both your customers and your employees. The challenge is to balance the awareness for trends and momentum without making yourself or your product a slave of those. It’s like surfing. You can’t change the ocean, so you need to observe and read the water and get on your feet in the exact right moment to ride the wave.Niklas Zennström, co-founder of Skype, invested in Wunderlist one year after we’ve launched it. He started Skype in Sweden. One of the first things he talked with me about was ““Look at Skype. If we would have been successful in Sweden, we wouldn’t have been successful at all. Build Wunderlist in a way so it can be used all over the world, in every country and every language. This has been a key piece of advice for me. Right after launching Wunderlist, we open-sourced the first version to get additional help from our community. It took just a few days until Wunderlist had been translated into more than 20 languages. It’s now a global product, in US, Asia, Europe and Africa. It was an important learning for us, that Germany, even though we started here, is not our only market. Our market is the world, we build a product for everyone.The more we grew, the more we also understood about the differences of countries and cultures. Our top countries today are the US  China, Germany, United Kingdom, Netherlands, China and Japan, but all those countries have key differences. Germany for example — it’s easy to scale and grow, it’s harder to satisfy and monetize though. US, is much easier to monetize, but it’s really tough to gain attention.Do your homework before you start with your idea, understand how big your market is, understand in which countries you can grow the fastest. Build a brand and a product that works globally, not just in your country. When I talk about entrepreneurship, I often talk about athletes. Athletes always train with a clear objective, like participating in a competition, or more specifically winning it. If you want to be an entrepreneur, think like an athlete and define your own mission. Why do you want to build a business? What’s your main objective as an individual? What do you want your own career to look like in 30 years? Don’t be small-minded! Widen your horizon and think how you want to influence the people around you, and maybe even change the world. When I think about my company, I often think about it like a football club. If I want to compete with other world-class football clubs, my motivation can’t only be winning. It also has to be passion — for what we are creating and the hard work that must go into making our goals a reality. I need world-class trainers, mentors, medics and most importantly, a world-class team. Attracting world-class staff can be done through money, but there is also a further important factor that increases your chances of winning talented people — and that’s culture.It’s not just the money that defines the success of your business, but also your very own approach of doing things. If you I regularly watch documentaries about different trainers, to understand how they motivate their teams. It’s unrelated to the startup world, but I can highly recommend to watch “At I think an issue many talented entrepreneurs and European founders (especially German founders) have is, they don’t think big enough. They have great ideas, but they often don’t have the ambition that is necessary to build something big and long-lasting. One reason for this is fear. Fear to be seen as naive or even crazy. When I was 18 and started my career in Berlin, I was often expressing my ambitions in public, and I personally experienced that “roll-eye-moment”. You will have that too, and honestly, fuck it.Ignore the naysayers, stay true to yourself, build the company you want. Finding the right mission often is a long process that requires a lot of thinking and learning. If you want to attract great talent, your mission is key. People want to understand why they should join your company, and it’s often an emotional decision. Try to be the next Steve Jobs, the next Elon Musk, the next Bill Gates. Dream of building a huge company, a billion-dollar business that can last for many years. A company that can employ thousands of engineers and designers, acquire companies, and support a creative working environment. If you ask me, that’s exactly what Berlin (and Europe) needs — ambitious, creative and successful billion-dollar businesses.That’s a tough one, but it’s so important. Starting a global tech business with international, well-educated and highly-skilled people, generating millions of revenue per month, is It’s important you understand the risks, and start managing them. If you blindly run into a new adventure, these lows will hurt much more than they should. The better you do your homework, the more likely your company will be able to survive. I wish, I would have prepared better, because there were This is what happened to me, while starting 3 different businesses:Starting a company isn’t easy. However, there is a way to help manage risks and to deal better with day-to-day challenges — and that is by having great co-founders. Having the Founders don’t necessarily need to become managers also. I started my company with 5 friends — one developer, one user interface designer, one visual designer, one marketing person, and a finance person. I was the most experienced developer at that time, and after we had built the first version of Wunderlist I quickly focused primarily on the business side. We were a junior team, everyone with just a few years of experience. We had never built a Mac app before, nor a iPhone app, but we had 3 years of experience working together as an agency, building websites and designing brands and products for various clients. This team helped me to start our business incredibly fast. Within weeks of starting the company we already launched a product. This is totally unique. It worked for us, but, that doesn’t mean it will work for you. Finding co-founders is hard, and I would never recommend to hire a co-founder — usually you start a business with people you know for years (as there is already an existing level of trust there and you also know they are capable of fulfilling their duties).For a tech business I recommend to start with a founding/management team of 4 people:Also, traditionally 1 of those 4 people should take over the leading role. There are ways to build up a company without a leading role, but I think it’s more than healthy to ultimately give someone the authority to make the final call. It helps you keep up the speed.When it comes to equity, be fair. Everyone should invest the same energy and the same amount of time. Also think about your first employees, it’s normal to let employees participate in the companies financial success by giving away virtual stock options (I will talk about that more next in the next part of this series). Make sure you hire an experienced lawyer for setting up the company. If you decide to start your business in Berlin, I can recommend working with There are two ways of starting a tech business. You either do it on your own, taking all risks and responsibilities yourself (“bootstrapping”), or you find investors that believe in your company. Both ways are great, I’ve tried both, but personally I wouldn’t try to start something again without partners. Wunderlist is the first business I secured the interest of experienced investors, including Working with investors, or without, are both challenging paths to starting your own business. An investor’s job is to provide assistance and guidance while at the same time challenge you. They need to challenge your way of thinking, your way of doing business, and your way of building products. Beware, it’s not always fun. If you don’t like to work with many different opinions, don’t do it. Investors can make your life much harder than it has to be, especially in tough times. But they can also boost your business into completely new dimensions, that you may not have even thought possible on your own.When you start your first tech business, avoid the common mistakes. Don’t pitch too early, and don’t pitch to world-class venture capitalists before you are ready. Prepare a working prototype, showcase the product you actually want to build, or at least demonstrate that you are able to build it. If you want to get an investor on board, try to understand what investors care about — it’s mainly the team and the product. Most first-time entrepreneurs write huge business plans, instead of creating a Before you start talking to large VCs, find some early stage investors. Stefan Tirtey, created this document with If you raise money for the first time, you better understand the basics of venture capital. Another important factor investors care about is how the business is structured (like who owns what). I’ve seen a few businesses where the first investors took huge pieces of equity for very little money. Avoid making those mistakes and define a fair structure. While every business is structured differently, here is how I believe you should structure a tech business in Europe (as a first-time entrepreneur!):Again, starting a business with investors may sounds “easier”, but it clearly isn’t. You just share the risks (and the outcome). If you decide to start something without an external investment, you usually start more carefully and slower with a lot less room for mistakes.Determining who to hire is a powerful skill to have and it’s very difficult to learn. As a founder you need to develop this skill very quickly. You will make mistakes early on, and it’s vital that you identify them and correct them very quickly. Creating a sustainable, healthy and positive company culture in a fast-growing and fast-changing startup environment is tough, and many companies fail at it.When I started my first business, I often got advised to hire “A people”. I had no clue what it meant, but I assumed it meant “very good”. Now, after having hired more than 60 people, I think it’s pretty much nonsense. “A people” do exist, but if you start a business for the very first time they are most likely not in your reach.When I started hiring my first engineers, designers and marketers, I was mainly focused on passion, energy and most importantly potential. I hired very junior people, many directly from college, or from their first jobs. When I interviewed, I tried to quickly get an understanding on how much they understood their actual role, how fast they wanted to improve, and how badly they wanted to be successful. I also tried to determine how well they would fit into the team, and I specifically I wanted to get a feeling if they could develop as quickly as the business would require. I didn’t hire them because I thought those people were incredible, but because they showed promise. I often get asked, where do I find these people. I honestly had a very simple strategy, I hired Wunderlist users to build Wunderlist. We’ve had a lot of success promoting job openings through newsletters to our user base as well as through our social media channels. More than half of our team has been recruited somehow through our product.The next big lesson you need to learn is to fire people. If you are a passionate entrepreneur, and you care about your team, firing is the hardest thing you will do. You will fire people for different reasons. Maybe they don’t fit, or they aren’t good enough (which means it’s your mistake for hiring them), or you need to reduce costs. Letting people go is emotional, and hard. People tend to cry, or get angry. Same goes for people who decide to leave, for whatever reason. Respect the decision, don’t stop a traveler (but try really hard to keep the ones who struggle), and always be professional. It’s a long road to learn those skills, but you will get there.It’s very hard as a young entrepreneur to correct hiring decisions. Don’t be scared to correct your mistakes quickly. Also, if your business grows, don’t lose the skill to objectively judge your team. It’s often hard for your initial team to keep up with the progress of the business, you are entering new stages very quickly. It’s often hard to talk about, but when a business grows up, it’s often time to improve the team, rather than grow it.Fred Wilson wrote about this I wrote this a couple of times now, but I want to make it clear. I think the key to create a healthy and sustainable company culture is serious transparency. I know, everyone is talking about honesty and transparency as a good thing, but many entrepreneurs simply suck at it. Don’t try to hide anything from your team, talk openly about any kind of expectations and challenges, and try to be positive about it. Being a good motivator is very hard, but it can be learned.The road from being a founder, to becoming a CEO or a manager is a very long and bumpy one. Most good founders somehow are crazy, in a good way. They often have ridiculous work ethics, are naive, and ignore what others say. They are often simply not the ideal person to work with. It rarely ends good if those founder attributes meet the pressure of a young company trying to survive.We had a pretty intense year in 2012, experiencing an unsuccessful product launch. Most of us had a hard time dealing with the pressure we had, many were close to giving up. Startups are not always fun, and for us, last year was not much fun at all. Luckily we’ve managed to get through it, but it seriously wasn’t easy. Those times are tough, but you know what? Those times see you earn your stripes. They help you to become a seriously good manager.There is an insanely good article written by Ben Horowitz, that I recommend every founder read, both in hard and in good times — it’s Being a manager and being a founder are two different things. You need to learn this very quickly. A founder often sets the tone, the mission, the speed, the ethic, the culture. Being a founder — a programmer, or a designer, or a salesperson — requires a totally different skill set than being a manager. Being a founder means to work — being a manager means to think. The job of a manager is to carefully make decisions, easy ones and tough ones. You need to define the business strategy, recruit people, build teams, motivate employees, set and measure goals, empower ownership, create partnerships, take care of financials etc. These skills are hard to develop, I remember clearly, when I started this business, I didn’t want to be the CEO most of the time. I was a programmer, building the first version of Wunderlist for Windows  Mac. I loved helping our developers to build the first sync servers, I loved designing the product and defining the marketing strategy. I had a seriously hard time to reduce myself from the actual work and focus on the business side. The additional pressure as being “the person in charge” didn’t make it easier for me to deal with that transition, and I honestly think the transition process will still take a few more years to be finally over. I’m a hands-on manager, I love diving into things. But it also often makes me operate as a micro manager, which rarely gets us where we want to be.As a founder I was involved in every little detail, from design, to development, to PR and marketing, but today I focus mainly on internal tools and processes, defining goals, business development and other more high level areas of the company. I still am (and want) to be part of our product team, but the time I can spend on the little details is very limited (down to a few hours per week). I became a CEO, and I wasn’t fully prepared. I would strongly recommend that if this is the role you want to take on, prepare yourself early, right from the very beginning.Throughout this guide I’ve mentioned a couple of times that I’m lucky to have mentors and advisors on my side, helping me to define a strategy for building Wunderlist. In retrospect, after working on it for more than 4 years, and going through some intensive ups and downs, I can truly say: having these people around me is one of the biggest reasons it all still exists. To be even more clear, without these people, I’m convinced it would have never started in the first place.Back when I was thinking about starting a new company, I was running an agency business. Together with my co-founders, we started by building a simple web app based task manager on PHP called We had no money to start the business on our own, so I posted a simple status message on LinkedIn: Together, we took our prototype, defined a product roadmap and started building it. Because those guys made investments in other tech companies, they had a lot of experience in critical success factors of software businesses. Together, we turned Lunchbox, which again was a Without posting this one message, and without the experience of Frank and Marc, Wunderlist would not exist. We would have never started the business, we would never have built mobile and desktop apps, and we just wouldn’t have executed it the way we did. Not only because both guys invested in the company, but because they worked with us on business strategy, product, design, marketing and technology. Together, they allowed us to start this company in a big way — they were Mentors are a great way of widening your horizon when you start a business, and I believe every founder should have one or more. Actually, most successful tech entrepreneurs have incredible, experienced and strong mentors — When people talk about mentors, they often use the term “advisors” as well. There is no official explanation for it, but I would clearly define 3 different types of supporters you can add to your company:Investors are often wealthy individuals or organizations who invest in your business, with the clear goal to have a great financial return. At the early-stage, investors are also often your mentors, but it can be hard to connect with investors as much as you can connect with individuals who respect you and are simply interested in your personal success. Investors are usually more interested in building and scaling up the business and less in your personal development.Mentors are focused on helping you to grow as an individual and a leader. Mentors invest time in understanding your business and challanges and more importantly, in you. Especially as a young or first time founder it’s incredibly helpful to get mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs.Advisors can add strategic value to your business (e.g. if you want to enter new markets or work with big corporations). They help you to understand networks, markets and try to advise you to make the right decisions. You can have advisors for every part of your business (like partnerships, or product, or marketing).You can offer both advisors and mentors equity in exchange for support, but be careful not to create artificial interest. They should be interested in you and less in your company. They are not employees, but first and foremost they help you to succeed as an individual. At an early stage, be sure, he or she commits to at least spending some hours each week working with you. Advisors I learned many painful but great lessons over the past few years. One was how to deal with constant change. When you decide to build a technology company, you are faced with one of the fastest moving industries on the planet. Technology changes so quickly, and along with it, markets and people.When we started, Facebook and Twitter were exploding, transforming the way companies handle marketing. Apple had just created a gigantic app market, making the development for mobile incredibly important. There was almost no Android, no Mac App Store, and no iPad. The market was moving so quickly, we had to constantly adapt our product strategy. Being in a constantly changing environment like the tech industry makes it really difficult to forecast trends and developments, and requires a massive focus on flexibility. When you are building a product, be ready to change essential parts of it within weeks, if not days. Be ready to expand and to tackle new opportunities quickly. And more so, make sure your team is ready, too.Constant changes in startups happens everywhere. You are constantly adjusting and optimizing internal processes, adapting your development strategy due to changing markets, modifying a fundraising strategy because of a financial crisis, replacing managers because of bad performances — this list just goes on and on and on.From a pure software perspective, within the last 10 years there has been an incredible change. 10 years ago, building software was fundamentally different. Software was very business focused (e.g. Office), complex, and feature-driven. Building such products was complicated, and required years of development. Then suddenly, software went mobile and got simplified. Within a few years, the requirements of building a great software product completely changed. Today, software is winning by design, intuitiveness and availability — not just by features. Mobile devices and apps made software a mass market phenomenon and changed the way software is built entirely.Identifying changes in a market, and knowing when the time has come for a strategy shift becomes critical for any kind of tech business. Many startups fail because the technology stack doesn’t fit the requirements of the market, or because the key platform changed completely. Make sure to not only build your product in the most flexible and scalable way, but also invest time in creating a company culture that embraces change in order to use the full potential of your team, no matter what the new challenge is going to be. The more flexible you run your product and company, the more likely you will have a chance to win.Being mindful while maintaining just the right sense of urgency is incredibly hard. It requires a lot of experience to give people the freedom to learn and more importantly, to fail.Our industry is full of young millionaires, and that’s not necessarily a good thing. It’s very easy to meet people with bad intentions, people who don’t care about anyone but themselves. Define your personal values, think carefully how you want to be successful, and how you want to celebrate it.Becoming successful will change your personality, either in a positive, or in a negative way — it’s your decision. When Steve Jobs got asked what his biggest weakness was, he answered: “(Founder and CEO 

Most online platforms have very little or no value of their own. The value is created by users and as more users join in, more value is created, which over time sets up a positive feedback loop. Hence, the more an online platform scales, the more valuable it becomes. YouTube is more useful with more videos, Facebook is more useful when more of your friends use it, eBay is more useful to buyers when there are more sellers, and vice versa.However, Under what conditions do online platforms lose value as they scale?Since the participants on an online platform create value, an online platform loses value with scale when the participants it allows in OR the information/value that they create are not curated appropriately. Poor curation leads to greater noise which makes the platform less useful.Let’s look at a few factors that increase noise and drive down the value of online platforms as they scale.Every online platform is as valuable as the participants it connects. Quora, a popular QA site found rapid adoption in Silicon Valley as it connected highly successful early tech adopters, who were experts in their field. Quora’s strong curation mechanism also ensures that the best answers get showcased invariably.The Quora community has created a deep repository of knowledge, thanks to these experts. However, as Quora scales, many worry that less sophisticated users, entering the system, may increase noise leading to a rapid depletion of value for existing users.This starts a reverse feedback loop because current experts start abandoning the system owing to the poor quality, which leads to further loss of quality, which in turn leads to other experts leaving. If a loop like that is set into motion, the quality of interactions and of the content created can witness an exponential drop.We’ve seen this reverse feedback loop work out in the case of ChatRoulette, a network of video chatters that connects you with anyone across the world at random. Since ChatRoulette had absolutely no checks and balances to screen users, it ended up with The Naked Hairy Men Problem. As the network grew, unpoliced, an increasing number of naked hairy men joined in leading to an exodus of other users. As legitimate users fled, the relative noise on the platform increased further leading to a feedback loop that saw the site lose traction at nearly the skyrocketing pace that it had gained it.Wikipedia demonstrates that any online platform is open to abuse. Incorrect Wikipedia articles demonstrate the vulnerability of a user-created platform as much as the volume of the correct ones demonstrate the strength.The problem of incorrect articles (noise) increases as networks scale as policing these platforms becomes more complicated with scale. In a world of community-created knowledge, who gets access to the community ultimately impacts the knowledge that is created.When exposed to a lot of information, we are likely to read what we agree with. Online systems use filters to personalize the information served to each participant. These filters are often created based on the participant’s past behavior. Over time, this personalization can lead to inadvertent reinforcement of what we already believe in.YouTube, for example, serves us videos based on what we’ve viewed in the past. Facebook’s news feed works on similar parameters.As a system scales, this over-personalization can lead to a constant firehose of information that is catered to what we already believe in, not what we need. This can prevent those seeking a solution, from being served a solution that is radically different (and effective) and may over-serve obvious solutions.Another problem that stems from reinforcement is the Hive mind. If certain forms of behavior are encouraged on a platform during the early days and certain others are discouraged, it runs the risk of leading to a Hive mind as the network scales where certain behaviors get reinforced and established as the desirable behaviors. Reddit is an online network, whose community is often criticized for having a Hive mind.This can lead to an online community getting too inward and insular (and, hence, of lower overall value) and failing to incorporate the value that diverse participants bring.On the internet, value is often conferred by community. E.g. The best answer to a question on Quora is decided by the community through upvotes and downvotes. Value is dynamic and constantly evolving, best exemplified by a Wikipedia article which is in constant flux.For all its advantages, this dynamic and community-shaped creation of value is also open to inadvertent acceptance. If enough number of participants accept something as true, it becomes the new truth, even if it isn’t. The answer that bubbles to the top and the latest version of an article are all decided by the community, and are a function of the quality of the community.Consider an online platform that enables sharing of knowledge globally and helps those looking for an answer to connect with those who have the answer. The best contributions don’t always come from existing experts, neither do the existing experts understand the context of needs in remote areas. Hence, micro-experts are needed to deal with the long tail of problems.The creation of new niche experts, requires a curation model that effectively separates the best from the rest. Creation of experts, traditionally, has been done on the basis of achievements or affiliations with certain trusted bodies. Creating that trust on an online platform is extremely important if one is to create new experts.This curation of micro-experts is non-trivial. Not only are they more in number than any team of traditional experts, they need to be curated by the community for the model to be scalable. Quora, for example, creates new experts, largely relying on community voting.As the network scales, it often finds it increasingly difficult to identify new experts as community sentiment tends to be biased towards early participants. Early users on Quora and Twitter tend to have orders of magnitude higher followers than those who joined in late, not only because they had more time, but also because:The community’s power to curate depends on two aspects:Every platform has its own way of building authority and/or trust. Ebay and AirBnB do it through ratings, Wikipedia through edit wars, Quora through votes. A network needs a fool-proof model for building participant authority to ensure that the right opinions are served for consumption.However, as a network scales, trust and authority systems become more difficult to scale as well. It becomes much more difficult to identify the corner cases.The systems that survive are the ones that scale. For every Reddit and Quora out there, there are a thousand attempts that gained traction but failed to scale because they failed at curation.For all its efforts at scaling, Wikipedia successfully controls the quality of only the top 20% articles that lead to 80% views. As any platform scales, curation methods tend to work very effectively for the ‘Head’ but not for the long tail of user contributions. This runs the risk of long tail abuse. While it can be argued that the majority doesn’t get affected by such abuse, the minority that does get affected increases as the network scales and as the curation problem itself gets exacerbated.Exploring the disruption caused by online and mobile platforms

About a month ago I quit my job as a journalist at a tech blog to found a startup.I started at VentureBeat with no knowledge of tech whatsoever. I didn’t have a smartphone or Twitter account, but quickly became dazzled by what seemed a glittering world of innovation and possibility.Over time, the luster faded. The pitches came in an endless stream — startup after startup backed by millions of dollars in venture capital, building technology that doesn’t solve serious problems or improve the world in any discernible way. Grey cynicism started to creep in. Finally I couldn’t take it anymore.After 1,740 stories and 20 months at VB, I left to create my own company — one that applies the tremendous possibilities of technology to supporting things that matter.Granted, I was an unconventional tech reporter from the beginning.I studied English and Art History at Cornell and then joined the Peace Corps, which sent me to a rural Thai rice farming village as an education volunteer. I spoke Thai, showered with a bucket, and attempted to tackle the serious problems my site faced — teen pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, rampant alcoholism and smoking, low high school graduation rates.I regularly questioned — and still do — whether I made a difference in my community, but the act of trying felt important.I returned in 2011 to an unfamiliar and alienating America where everyone was glued to their iPhones. The connectivity overwhelmed me after years of extended solitude. I had no idea what to do with my life post Peace Corps, and so made the impulsive decision to move to San Francisco.As fate would have it, I fell in love with an entrepreneur who encouraged me to apply for a job at VentureBeat. They took a risk in hiring me (for which I am eternally grateful) and I threw myself headlong into the startup scene.My first month at VB felt a lot like my first month in Thailand, with fewer mangos. I not only had to learn about this unfamiliar, complicated new world, but also had to write about it, and fast, for an audience of highly intelligent readers who live and breathe the industry and are unafraid to tear your words apart in comments.It was terrifying and exhilarating at the same time.One of my main frustrations about my time in Thailand was the isolation and lack of resources. Things moved slowly and changed even slower in the village, and the startup world seemed a glorious counterpoint.I worked furiously — as all VB reporters do — to stay on top of breaking news, get scoops, and write well-contextualized articles at a rapid pace. Part of my job was managing the never-ending flood of my inbox. I had to sort through what was worth writing about, what was uninteresting but had to be written about, and what belonged in the trash. A lot belonged in the trash.Slowly over time, as I churned out five or so articles a day, my enthusiasm waned. Every interesting, meaningful idea was buried amidst hordes of insipid ones. I longed for the days when “change” meant more than switching marketing automation providers.For all its ideals, the tech world is rife with insularity, arrogance, and ill-spent talent. It was enough to disillusion even me, who started out as a starry-eyed optimist enamored with an industry I believed had the power to change the world.I still believe that. However I also believe that not enough emphasis or value is placed on doing good. Tech companies and entrepreneurs aren’t giving back as much as they could be. That’s not to say all tech companies and entrepreneurs are guilty of this — there are amazing socially-minded startups and individuals out there — just that too much energy goes into solving stupid problems.This is why we are building Social media and smartphones have come to affect everything we do. These channels offer the powerful ability to connect people, share stories, and amplify reach. A tidal wave of “mobile, social” apps have emerged as a result. We’ve got mobile social photo-sharing. Mobile social shopping. Mobile social restaurant-finding. Mobile social driving. Mobile social dating. Mobile social gaming. Mobile social payments. Mobile social jogging.And yet, we don’t see mobile social giving — despite the fact that $316.2 billion is donated to charity a year, 88% of U.S. households give to charity, and there are 1.5 million charities in the U.S. alone, representing a third of the U.S. workforce.Online donations account for a paltry 7% of all donations, and mobile donations an even smaller fraction. This is a missed opportunity. Non-profits (and the people they serve) could benefit from a dose of startup culture. Mobile connectivity, user experience and design, social media, growth hacking, quick iteration, data-tracking, striving for scale — these forces could dramatically amplify efforts to alleviate poverty, just as they do adoption of the latest photo app.The world is an increasingly inter-connected place filled with monumental problems. If just a minor portion of the resources spent on digital junk food went towards empowering women, getting homeless people back on their feet, making sure the 7 billion people on the planet are fed, healthy, and can live with dignity — oh what a [tech] world that would be.Former writer at VentureBeat

A month or so ago we were feeling a little burned out on our main project. So we did what we often do when it is time for a break: allow ourselves a week to work on something new and crazy, publish it, and see how it goes. It’s a great way reset your thinking, have fun building something from scratch, and take a quick shot at a cool idea.This time, our idea was called “There are a few reasons we chose Android for this project. First and foremost, Android allows an app (once it asks for the appropriate permissions) to see what all the other apps are on the phone — very important for this concept! We also felt we could make this product much We started on a Friday, stuck to our schedule, and by the following Thursday the app was released. We posted it to the However, the next day we started to see a trickle of users, which quickly became a torrent. We soon discovered that our app had been posted to the During that wild week, we were also releasing the app at least once a day, and often two or three times. Many of those updates were crucial to fixing critical bugs and handling the load. Once again, we don’t think it would have been possible to get through those rough couple of days if we couldn’t rely on quick and reliable app updates.So, the project has seen some early success. In fact, we think it has good promise and we are still working on it. But the main point here is that we didn’t know that this app would be a good idea when we built it. We just though that it was a fairly interesting and powerful idea. That’s probaby how many good ideas look at first. When targeting the web, you can have an idea, build it quickly, iterate, debug, enhance and see if users respond to it. Mobile makes that far more difficult, especially iOS. Waiting a week for a review is a huge impediment. Ideas that disrupt the “accepted” workflow of the phone are typically rejected by Apple. We don’t doubt that even if it had been possible to implement AppChat’s features on iOS, it would have been rejected by Apple’s reviewers anyways. Even if we had managed to get it released, we would have been unable to update the app quickly enough to respond to our deluge of users. All of these factors result in a shift in strategy away from MVP and back to something akin to the late 90s dot-com approach: envision the “perfect” product, carefully and time-intensively build it, deploy a “launch strategy”, and then hope for the best.Android’s more open, speedier model — while not perfect — gets us far closer to that pure, fast, iterative MVP experience that we think is needed to allow developers to try the weird, silly, funny or even stupid ideas that, occasionally, turn into the best and coolest new consumer apps.Co-founder of Larva Labs

Turning your idea into a real product or business takes real people as users or customers. The goal of this article is to help you validate (or grow) your business by reliably sending relevant visitors to signup for your product or service. I want to help you do this by evaluating acquisition channels, setting up your first ad campaigns and experimenting with your landing page and ad copy.Im expecting you to be an entrepreneur or product owner who has an existing landing page, a target persona/customer and Make sure that you have a strong landing page for converting target customers before sending lots of traffic. This means you should have direct and clear copy that will match your ads, a complimenting design, direct and actionable CTA and necessary analytics for measuring. Id suggest checking out a previous post Id also put some good thought into what happens when people sign up. You dont want to be sending lots of traffic to something that cannot keep people engaged or activated. I often use the analogy of pouring water (traffic) into a bucket (your product) to capture value. You suddenly begin to lose value you’ve captured if you have holes in the bucket (your product).Make sure you follow up with signups or have suitable onboarding for your product. If your product is more mature your leaks are most likely retention or referral based activities (or lack of them).To make sense of any paid advertising you need to be tracking your efforts against a metric such as signups. For every single ad you create you will want a specific and unique URL that carries UTM parameters.Having unique UTM parameters helps track down what ad and channel is sending your This is why I created a simple to use You can also manually create these links using the Getting started can be tricky as there are lots of possible places to advertise your but putting your best foot forward is important. Ill first start AdWords for 4–5 days before Facebook, Twitter. I do this as you can begin to test ad copy with customers who are searching for a solution. Ill then use these learnings for future channels. This definitely does not work for every niche, Ill often skip AdWords if I find the keywords to be saturated and expensive or if Im targeting a persona more than a problem.Thankfully the first time you set up an AdWords account they walk you through a good setup process. For the less savvy they even launched AdWords Express which makes the process even more simple.You can also expect an advertising rep to reach out to you before and during your campaign. In the past these reps are hit or miss on their helpfulness but if these are your first campaigns take all the help you can get.Start with the Some early criteria to follow..Often a great channel depending on your product and service, I’ve found the best success here with look-a-like audiences based on signups I already have on my landing page, and retargeting using AdRoll or Facebooks Conversion Pixel. If you dont have any users or visits dont sweat it, Facebook has some great targeting settings that take some time to investigate.As you get to creating your campaign but your best foot forward by targeting the ad at your target personas.Combine all of the audience targetting Facebook provides you to get as close as you can.Keep your eye on the “Potential Reach” Facebook estimates as well as their Specific / Broad rating as you dont want to get too specific you’ve eliminated possible customers, but not too broad youre advertising to irrelevant people.Depending on the product and niche Ive had some great successes using Twitter advertising. The trick here is to stand out as Twitter has no shortage of noise and distractions, I’ll spend the biggest chunk of my time designing ads here using a value proposition that matches my landing page.To get started I usually leverage Twitters basic targeting similar to my Facebook approach but here is based on keywords. Avoid most of the single keywords that Twitter suggests as I will often hone down on problem related tweets or people who follow complimenting or competitor products.I usually try to collect 10,000 impressions or $100 on a campaign before I can really determine whether the CPC or conversions are poor. As I approach this number Ill trim out poor performing ads, keywords and targeting.The key is to continue experimenting with different combinations of copy both in ad and on page. I usually expect to take 2–3 iterations on a channel before I find a good reason to scale.Access myArtist  Entrepreneur who likes marketing and product design. Follow me A collection of articles that take a lean and agile approach to building a startup. Topics range the life cycle of a startup from start to finish and end.

Every startup idea I’ve had has been haunted by these thoughts:Time and time again, these concerns make me seriously question whether a startup idea is a massive waste of my time. I don’t use the word “massive” lightly. My fear of wasting time is rooted in my sharp awareness of opportunity cost, a jaded sensitivity to prolonged periods of startup stress, and the sheer desire for genuine startup success.As for I’m sure you’ve had similar concerns. I am not alone in my thoughts.So, then, how should we entrepreneurs overcome this poisonous mindset?Head-on. That’s how.In the early stages of a product, your approach to your market must be repositioned from “We are special” to “We are merely cloning an existing competitor… feature-by-feature.” Even if that’s not at all the case, When you do this, there ceases to be time pressure to complete your MVP (or new release) because you are no longer beating anyone to market. Instead, you’re entering the market Yes, the best startups are monopolies. They So, instead of looking at a business as a series of milestones, consider this: You should psychologically compress the horizon of marketplace competition into a singular moment you’re constantly living in. Imagine that everything you build will be instantly copied. The end result is that the only forward momentum your business experiences is the phenomenon of broadening your addressable market. This happens equally to you and your competitors. You are in this together. You’re part of a flux; you’re simply along for a ride. But it’s a hell of a ride to be on.Once you’ve adopted this perspective, you cease to look at the startup game as consisting of one-upping competitors, but simply as a game of maintaining your status as a viable competitor. That’s a much easier burden to bear because, if you are sufficiently perceptive of what your competitors are up to and if you have a competent engineering team behind you, you no longer have to disproportionately self-impose time pressure. Startup life becomes drastically less stressful.Once you embrace this, the fear of “How long until I’m copied” dissipates.The underlying, long-term concern over competition is losing the customers you already have. That’s it. There’s no other When Facebook eventually dominates the world, what will be their next step? Retention. Retention is always the final step. Remember: User growth isn’t the ultimate goal of a business — revenue growth is. Compel your existing users to stay, and you can find new ways to monetize them in a way that’s mutually beneficial.I’m going to explain why focusing on retention will alleviate your concerns about competition. First off, let’s establish context: It is much easier for most startups to improve retention by 5% (i.e. improve support or features) than it is for them to increase user adoption by 5% (i.e. spend money on ad buys or spend time and energy brokering deals). Second, retention is far easier to be in control of than growth is. Growth is fickle; there are a million user segments and a million ways to address them. Retention is less fickle: You already have well-defined, observable users who want your product — so the onus is on you to simply talk with them and react to their concerns appropriately.When a competitor releases a novel and worthwhile feature, you must simply respond with 1) appropriate engineering resources and 2) open communication with your users. That’s it. There’s no difficult innovation to work through; the competitor already put the pieces together for you. Yes, the dynamic of wait-and-respond means you will always have work to do, but — again — if you set out to only do work once before flipping a switch and relaxing in the Bahamas, then you’re not in the game for the love of the game. You’re just in the game to make quick money and bounce. And, in that case, this article isn’t for you.Speaking of brand advocates, my favorite quote in Peter Thiel’s book, And that’s the crucial concept that entrepreneurs fearing competition fail to realize: [1] Tangent: Unless you’re crazy enough to build an entire company off nothing other than access to Twitter’s firehose without having long-term contracts in place. If that’s the case, you deserve the sudden death coming to you.Change is inevitable: Your company is not special. Never allow yourself to think that you’re doing something unique. You’re simply expanding a marketplace that many competitors partake in. Respect that — don’t fight it. Your competition is a living organism that will adapt just like you do; they will always exist in one form or another.Retention is king: Every day, fight to carve out a piece of the market that you can call home. A home is where users love to stay. Homes don’t grow fast because families (employees and users) don’t grow fast, but — crucially — healthy families never fade away. They persist throughout the ages.That’s it. Change is inevitable and retention is king. Internalize that, and don’t ever stress yourself over competition going forward.I have a lot more thoughts on this subject. Founder. Developer.

You have a great startup idea. Enthusiastically, you exercise your technical chops and begin coding. After weeks of long, caffeine-fueled nights, you release your product to the world with anticipation. But no one cares.We’ve heard this story before. Far too often, entrepreneurs build something that does not solve a One less known approach is the blog-first method. That’s right, a simple blog post Danielle Morrill poured her heart out when she announced the death of her startup, Referly. Shortly afterward, she published She followed with additional posts analyzing 500 Startups, TechStars, Andreessen Horowitz, and other portfolios, all of which received similar attention. The topic clearly struck a cord in the startup and investment community and she continued writing every day. Danielle published 89 essays over 10 weeks, building an audience before announcing her new venture.On May 2nd Dubbed the “Bloomberg for startup investors”, the product was an expansion of the Startup Index her audience feverishly consumed. Danielle cleverly built a following and proved that people valued the content through her blog before launching her new venture.In January, Zack Shapiro published an insightful essay on his blog, The post received enormous interest as readers enthusiastically suggested ways they might use the service, as exemplified by Inspired and affirmed by the feedback on his idea, Zack sought to turn his blog post into a reality. While working full-time at TaskRabbit, he started building the product during nights and weekends. On May 9th, three months later, Zack released Did you know that Groupon originally launched as a blog? The first version of the daily deal site was “totally ghetto,” Although not the most elegant or scalable solution, the blog enabled Groupon to quickly prove that people would pay for coupons, and helped it measure market demand with little upfront investment. “It was enough to prove the concept and show that it was something that people really liked,” Mason recalls. Once the idea was validated, Groupon expanded its operations and infrastructure far beyond its humble blog beginnings.In June of 2012, It turns out his idea wasn’t new when he published the rant. Dalton and his team had been working on a App.net went on to raise more than $803,000 from 18,000 customers that shared his vision, only six weeks after Dalton’s prolific blog post.Ghost, a new blogging platform, launched a Kickstarter campaign in April 2013, that generated massive attention in the open-source community. But it was actually a blog post that kicked off the movement five months earlier. John O’Nolan originally created a Within a few days of publishing the concept page, O’Nolan received more than 91,000 page views, mentions in Mashable, and an interview with PandoDaily. In addition to the exposure, hundreds of fans and criticsGhost’s supporters are now eagerly awaiting its public appearance, with the teaser site receiving 200,000 page views each month. While still in development, John built a following of 5,236 paying customers and 19,000 email subscribers growing at a rate of 2,500 emails each week.

Legendary entrepreneur David Sacks replied to my blog post “Not-so-legendary entrepreneur, but absurdly-legendary investor [ Click to Tweet (can edit before sending): Let’s soak in the two parts of what he said for a moment:This is particularly important for the “media” to understand, as they frequently judge founders harsher than they do their products. Now, I use the word “media” here because I’m defining two groups of people who create content: a) real journalists, and b) news-as-entertainment content creators.Why the distinction? Because folks who are doing SCREAMING-BUT-NOT-FACTUALLY-CORRECT headlines like If Sheryl Sandberg or Sean Parker judged that college dropout who put “I’m CEO, bitch!” on his business cards and screwed all his partners as … whatever … then we would have never seen Zuckerberg’s growing legacy — or his I’m not going to defend the long list of “founders with a history,” but we all know that few of us stand up to the worst moments in our younger days — founders of startups, investors, or journalists (or those of us who are all three). Also, we all need someone to believe we can be more than we are.Phil Jackson believed in Michael, Kobe, Shaq, and now Camelo — all imperfect and frequently derided when the Zen Master believed in them.Angel investing is an art, where you look at a nascent product which any sane person would find immature and unlikely to succeed, and say to yourself, “But what if it did?”That’s the same exercise you have to do with individuals. Sure, this scrappy extrovert or introvert, from Brooklyn or Nebraska, is underwhelming or awkward, but what if his/her polish and presence caught up with the drive?I sometimes draw the chart above for young entrepreneurs (or the older ones who are in a rut).

The night terrors, the teeth grinding, and the fights just, well, go away.Namaste, @I angel invest in awesome startups... and try to build them myself. Be excellent to each other.

We’re on a roll as more designers succeed on the path of entrepreneurship, but how do we decide which startups to work with? We need to be more diligent about not spending our scarce attention working on startups that go nowhere and learn how to pick ones that actually live up to all the hype.Here are five simple questions we asked before deciding to partner with startups like Airbnb, Dropbox, Pinterest, Square, and Khan Academy for our design education program, Start with the “Why?” when you talk with the founders and the rest of team. Ask them to articulate the mission and what gets them up in the morning day after day. Do you think they genuinely believe in the purpose of the company and does it strike a chord in your heart?The mission is what intrinsically motivates and sustains you through all the ups and downs of startup life. It makes getting in early and staying up late sweating details worth all the effort because you know you’re contributing to something positive that’s greater than yourself.In the case of Airbnb, its mission is to “make people feel at home, anywhere in the world.” I want more people to feel empathy for each other and ultimately create more belongingness. That’s a fundamental human need I can get behind.Arguably the most important factor in deciding to join a startup is the team.Ideally, you can surround yourself with teammates who are “better” than you in many ways because of their diverse backgrounds, skills and experiences. You’re greatly influenced by your peers and if they’re extraordinary, you’ll learn from them and continuously be pushed to improve yourself.Just like great engineers attract other great engineers, the same is true with designers. As you talk to designers and engineers at a startup, do you feel inspired and confident that you can learn a ton from them? Do you see evidence that the founders invest in design and value it at the same level as engineering and business?One essential thing to look for is if the startup even has a design team. If the company has dozens of engineers and only one or no designers, that’s potentially a red flag (although it could also be an opportunity for you to lead and create a design team… if you’re prepared for that).Why settle? Find your design dream team. For instance, many of designers at Dropbox have “past experience shipping wildly successful products including the original designers of Facebook, Spotify, Rdio, Instagram, and many more,” says Andrew Chin, Bridge alum.It’s easy these days to copy patterns and use new tools to become an “ok” designer. But if you want to take the quality of your work to the next level, surround yourself with people who are going to push you and not tolerate mediocrity.Watch out for big companies that have multiple layers of bureaucratic hierarchy or companies that are so established that they only make incremental changes for fear of losing what they’ve already gained. You want to be able to take risks and influence everything from the product all the way up to how the company itself is designed.Dig into how decisions actually get made at the company. Is there essentially a waterfall method where the founders or engineers make all the key decisions and then want designers to make it “pretty?”If so, turn around and walk away. You want a place with true collaboration.“We don’t like drawing lines between skill-sets like Design, Engineering, and Brand,” says Evan Sharp, Pinterest’s designer and cofounder. “We know that we’ll only be successful as a company if we empower the best people to build their absolute best work, and so design everything around that.“In this way, we’re always “knitting” and collaborating to produce the best results we can for Pinners.”Keep an eye out for how the company is organized. Does design have a strong voice and seat at the executive level or is it subordinate to some vice president? Does the company give designers amble budget to build the right team and invest in creativity, everything from supplies like white boards to large format printing?Also take a look at basic indicators like how the space is designed. Has the company invested in creating an environment that fosters collaboration across disciplines? When you talk to anyone at the company are they finding meaning in their work and does their behavior actually reflect the company’s values?I remember walking into Square’s creative space and being blown away by the creative energy flowing through the place – not just from product designers. There was something special when I saw photographers, filmmakers, and storytellers – roles you don’t normally see in startups.These kind of small details add up to create a culture that shows it values design in everything they do.Last but not least, if you join a startup, make sure you know what you could work on and how valuable your work might be.Are you going to be able to solve problems holistically or will you be pigeon holed into polishing off a feature? Is there a design need the company has that you can uniquely fill and if you succeed, will it move the needle for the business?Consider whether the company is at an interesting stage of growth, where they’re just at the cusp of taking off or at the early stages of developing a transformative product – these are moments where design can really make a difference.Ideally, there’s potential for you have a hand in affecting millions of people and potentially creating billions of dollars’ worth of value in the long run. You also want to make sure that if the company does well, you will too by having a significant equity stake.Very few opportunities in the world offer the type of upside startups can have in terms of impact and scale.“Working on a product that is used by millions of people is awesome, but one that empowers those millions to improve their lives and the lives of those around them creates orders of magnitude more impact in the world,” says Jason Rosoff, lead designer at Khan Academy.I hope these questions serve you well before you think about joining another startup.If you’re interested in connecting with top startups and a community of world class designers in San Francisco, Cofounder of Designer Fund.

Decide.com was acquired by eBay on September 6, 2013. For those unfamiliar with Decide, we invented technology that predicted the future price of consumer goods. Thinking about buying a Samsung television? We’d tell you whether the price would drop in the next two weeks. We helped you decide when to buy.I’m obviously happy with the outcome. From my brother’s basement, we raised $16.5M, employed 30 people and most importantly built something people found useful. Only in my wildest dream would I have the audacity to think I’d build something that would be acquired by a company like eBay.Although the outcome was positive, it’s helpful to reflect on the experience. Below are 3 lessons I learned from the experience. They’re not new but hopefully from within the context of a real startup they’re more tangible.We launched Decide.com on June 20th, 2011 with 20 people and 2 round of funding totaling $8.5M. That’s atypical, especially these days when investors want to see traction before investing. Instead of those resources helping us find market-fit it slowed us down.We focused on company building:Once we got through those parts, it was harder to change directions:Do whatever helps you reach market-fit faster. In my experience, that’s raising modestly (if at all) and keeping the team small. 2 or 3 people can get a lot done and is small enough where you don’t have to worry about structure or communication.You wouldn’t scale your technology to support 10M users when you only have 100. Don’t scale your company that way either.Our hiring criteria can be summarized with 2 basic questions: (1) Are they great at what they do? (2) Do we like them? Turns out there should’ve been a 3rd question. (3) Do you generally agree with me?We spent a lot of time debating rather than doing. What technology should we use? When should engineering get involved with the design process? What’s our design methodology? How long should our release cycles be? Should we even have release cycles? I could go on indefinitely.Decide how you want do things then hire people that want to do things that way. There’s value in having a diversity of opinion but in a early stage startups, the benefits (moving fast) of hiring people that generally agree with you outweigh the benefits (diversity of opinion) of hiring people that don’t.If you can’t hire anyone that agrees with you, re-evaluate how you want to do things.We started with support for 3 categories (televisions, laptops and cameras) but expanded into all electronics within the first year. Looking for more growth, we talked about a few options:We ended up doing a combination of 1 and 2. We built features (product recommendation, sentiment analysis, etc.) to help people figure out what to buy then expanded our coverage into appliances, home and garden, babies and kids. We looked for growth by expanding how often we would be relevant (more categories, cover more of the buying funnel).Most of our traffic stayed in electronics and our experience became thin. We were in a lot of categories trying to do a lot of things. I would’ve liked to see us do option 3, double-down on when to buy. That was the part of the market nobody else was playing in. Get that experience to be amazing then roll it out into other categories.Expanding your target market, like we did by supporting more categories and building when to buy features, doesn’t help you get to market-fit. In fact, I’d argue it makes it harder because there’s more needs to satisfy.Said another way, is it better to start with a small group of people who love what you’re building or a large group of people who are indifferent? I think you’d rather have the small group that love you. It’s easier to turn a small group of rabid users into a large group than a large group of indifferent users into a large group of rabid users.Keep your product narrow and focused on the small group of people most likely to love what you’re building.I don’t want to end this negatively because there’s a lot we got right. I just tend to learn more from failures than successes. Maybe I should write another post about worked for us. For now, let me tell you about my proudest moment at Decide, when we lost almost all our revenue.When we created the first version of our mobile app, we put Amazon’s prices next to everyone else’s just like we did on the web. Apparently Amazon doesn’t allow you to do that on a mobile device but it’s ok on the web. They want you to use their app to check their prices.We received a notice from them informing us we weren’t compliant and unless we removed it they’d suspend our affiliate account. We weren’t making a lot of money but that account probably represented more than 80% our revenue.We had 2 choices: (1) Comply and remove Amazon prices from our mobile app (2) Not comply, keep the prices and lose our biggest revenue stream. Proudly and with very little discussion, we decided not to comply. Most people want to buy from Amazon. Not being able to show those prices to our users wasn’t acceptable. In the 2 years since we got that notice we never complied. When faced with a decision where we had to choose between revenue or our users, we chose our users. I couldn’t have been more proud.Founder 

It has often been said that the hardware business is hard. Over the last two years, my team and I have been learning just how hard it can be. Our company makes a portable, precise milling machine for the maker, DIY, design, and small-batch manufacturing markets. It’s called the Othermill, and it’s our first product. For most of us, it’s also our first adventure into the world of manufacturing.Today we are announcing the second revision of this machine. Completely redesigned from the ground up, it’s the culmination of our last 12 months of hard work. It represents new software features, hardware refinements, and feedback from an ongoing conversation with our community of backers.For our Kickstarter release we set out to try and solve one problem, and solve it well: make circuit board milling as simple as possible. Now we turn our attention to 2D graphics. With our latest software release of Otherplan, were adding support for generic SVG files.We’re also announcing something else: an honest look into the process that went into designing this machine. Writing about one’s triumphs and failures in public is hard. This isnt something that product companies usually do. A new product launch is a carefully managed stage performance. Like a magician’s trick, if the audience sees the messy process that brought it to life, the magic is lost.We want to do something completely different. We’re a company with roots in education. We design machines for people who may never have heard of or seen a milling machine before — people who have never had access to this kind of technology. These people are about to embark on a journey, not unlike ours. One of triumphs, failures, and new lessons learned.Our customers are engineers, educators, artists, designers, and crafters. They work in giant tech firms, small design houses, in their garages, studios, and homes. These are people with giant dreams. Some are designing new products with our machine. Some are starting new businesses. Some are just building for themselves. All are learning. As we’ve watched our customers grow, we’ve seen their questions becoming more and more sophisticated. They are living the same story we are.For a company founded from the ashes of an educational research project, how can we not share what we’ve learned?This is the story of how our hardware startup was born.This may come as a surprise, but we never set out to make a milling machine. What had originally brought us all together was a different project. One with different goals, a different machine, and a very different approach than the one we’re taking now.When the project first started, the old pipe organ factory we worked in was still being remodeled. Every week the furniture would move. Every week a new piece of shop equipment would show up, or break down and need repair. Every week a visiting VIP would be led around and shown the various projects. Every few months a news crew would come through. It was the chaotic early days of Otherlab.I had started working at Otherlab as a contractor. Situated in the dusty old Schoenstein pipe organ factory in San Francisco’s Mission District, Otherlab is a research lab founded by Saul Griffith, Jack Bachrach, and Jim McBride. It’s full of machines, people, and research — most of it involving robotics. Our particular project was called MENTOR (Manufacturing Experimentation and Outreach). It was a DARPA-funded research and development program to “reinvent shop class for the 21st century.” We had secured a grant to design a web application and a set of courseware, all centered around a new class of computer-numerical-controlled (CNC) machine. This was the part I was excited about. It’s not every day one gets to design something like that.We started out as a two-person team. Jonathan Ward, a graduate of MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms, had a special skill for machine inception. I was a former Apple engineer who had run away to join the actual circus. With a kitted-out machine shop featuring a 600-watt laser cutter, five-axis router, and waterjet, it was a prototyper’s dream. Our machine was unique: a roll-fed, four-axis vibrating knife cutter. It was designed to do most of what a laser cutter could do at a fraction of the cost. As any visitor to TechShop can attest, laser cutters are popular. They’re very easy to use.Unfortunately, getting a laser cutter into schools is a challenge. They’re very expensive. Improperly used, they can release toxic gases. They’re also a constant fire hazard. Our machine was different. It could cut flat sheets of cardboard, foam core, fabric, balsa wood, and light plastics. Its main hazard was a trip to the nurse’s office for a cut from its tiny vibrating knife. Our DARPA program manager was impressed.We built somewhere between 10 to 15 variants of what was to become known as the Othercutter. As the project grew, so did the team. With my background in software, I designed and built an interactive 3D interface for the Othercutter. Forrest Green, another CBA graduate from MIT, designed the control algorithms for the machine. Eventually we needed a project manager, and brought on Danielle Applestone. With a PhD in materials science, she had been invited out to California to interview with Tesla Motors. Saul convinced her that bringing low-cost manufacturing technology to STEAM education was a better move.I led the technical team, and Danielle led everything else. We were hitting deadlines and things were going smoothly. Then suddenly, in March of 2013, the storm that had been brewing in Congress all winter finally hit. Automatic government sequestration went into effect. Education research projects in the military were low on the list of priorities. Our project, which was gaining momentum, suddenly lost its funding.We were done. All our plans, all our work, would go up in smoke if we couldn’t find something else fast.When youve already lost, it’s easy to take risks. I remember the first time I saw Jonathan’s mill. It was a side project, designed for himself. It was built in those aimless days as we scrambled to figure out what to do next. I remember seeing it, sitting on the table saw that Jonathan frequently used as his desk. A tiny 9x9x10 white cube with no fasteners, it was held together using little buckles cut into the frame, a technique he invented during his time at MIT, which he called MTM Snap. It was the same technique Jonathan had used while we were designing the Othercutter.I thought it was amazing. Years earlier, when I had first gotten into machining, I bought a desktop mill. It was almost 100 lbs, and I spent more time figuring out how to get it to do anything than actually making parts with it. A lot of my frustrations with those early experiences had kept me wishing for something different.Jonathan’s mill was tiny — you could carry it with one hand. It was also precise. Very precise. He had designed it for one purpose: to cut out 3x2 blank copper circuit boards for making guitar effects pedals. Within this highly constrained problem, Jonathan had designed a machine with the right set of mechanical and material properties. The frame was made out of plastic. It didn’t need metal to resist high-cutting forces. From a machine design standpoint, it was a Zen koan — a minimalist meditation in materials and methods.I wanted one, and I knew 50 other friends who would certainly want one as well. I asked Saul for $50,000 to build 50 mills and launch a Kickstarter. Milling machines have been around for a long time, and unlike the vibrating knife cutter, they’re well understood. All we had to do was rework the interface for the Othercutter, and make a few small changes to the mill. How hard could it be? We stopped working on the Othercutter and started in on the new machine. I called it the Othermill. In less than a month, we had a prototype of the new machine up and running. We were ready to go.Our Kickstarter launched and in 24 hours the first 50 machines were gone. In 30 days we had raised $300,000 and had 200 brand new customers. Running a Kickstarter is a roller coaster ride. You put yourself and your dream out there. If you don’t make it, there is the sadness. If you do make it, then the real work begins. Two hundred friends and strangers took a leap of faith and trusted us. Naively, we thought it would take us three months to get to launch.If you’ve never started a hardware company before, it’s very hard to understand the vast differences between a prototype, a product, and a company which supports it. A product is so much more than just the machine. It’s also the packaging, the quality assurance plan, documentation, the factory, the supply chain, vendor relations, testing, certification, distribution, sales, accounting, human resources, and a health plan. It goes on and on. All things you probably weren’t thinking about in the rush to get the Kickstarter launched.Our obstacle was that Jonathan had never intended MTM Snap for production. It was a design challenge experiment: to see if he could build a machine without screws. This is a great feature if you’re trying to save money as a graduate student, but from a manufacturing standpoint it had two major disadvantages. The first was that if you imagine the edges of the frame as a coastline, and you unravel and stretch it into a straight line, there’s a lot of edge. Cutting out the edges of the tiny frame would take a long time. The second, and larger problem, was that the buckles tended to come apart over time. Sure, you could just hit the loose side with a hammer if you knew what to look for, but that’s not something we felt we should be asking customers out in the world to do. In the end, we arrived at a hybrid design. One that used the locating pins, but reverted back to using more traditional fasteners.The next challenge was that at 4x3, we felt that the bed size was just too small. The only issue was that increasing the size of the rails, even by just an inch, would create a whole cascading host of interdependent design problems. To understand why, you need to know something fundamental about machine design.Everyone has heard of 3D printing by now. There are lots of different kinds of machines, but the most common, an FDM printer, works by extruding hot plastic through a rapidly moving printer head over a platform. A 3D printer has very different requirements than a milling machine. When a printer is extruding hot plastic, it only has to worry about the forces generated by moving the weight of the printing head. The lighter the printer head, the less force the 3D printer has to overcome to move it around.A milling machine, on the other hand, has a different challenge. It works by moving a rapidly rotating cutting tool through material at high velocities, cutting off tiny pieces as it travels. This generates an equal and opposite force that moves back through the cutting tool, through the spindle bearings spinning at 10,000 RPM, along every bushing, rail, and fixture contact point. Basically the force moves all through the machine and back to the part being cut. This is called the That’s just part of the problem, and it’s the easy part. The harder part is something called Jonathan’s mill had two very important features we wanted to preserve. It was portable, and it was accurate. That portability was important to me. A mill has always been a tool you go to visit, not one that comes to visit you. We wanted to change that. What kinds of places could a machine go if you could take it with you on public transit? Accuracy was also paramount. We set ourselves the goal of achievable repeatability in the range of +/- 0.001, and then pushed it even farther.We added handles, dust windows, an internal power supply, a new motion controller, bigger bushings and rails, a solid metal Z block to hold a newly designed industry-standard ER-11 spindle, a quieter belt drive, and a new Z-axis motor with better holding torque. Then we put the first model together and it took too long to assemble. We added holes to access internally buried screws, and zip-ties for cable routes. The engineering team polished and refined.The software team doubled in size. Getting our desktop application, which we called Otherplan, ready for launch was proving to be more work than anticipated. We were pushing the controller board farther than it’s designer, Alden Hart, had intended. We added new features to the firmware, like tool touch-off and probing.Perhaps the most controversial feature of the Othermill is its plastic frame. It’s the only commercially available mill to use plastic for the main structural loop. This allows us to incorporate many hidden features milled directly into the frame, creating a highly integrated mechanical system. Cable guides, wire routing, bearing pre-load flexures, alignment pins, lighting mounts, motor mounts, back panels, handles, tool holders, all get incorporated into the frame. The plastic sheets we use are lightweight, strong, and low cost. Best of all, the plastic machines quickly.One of the things I’ve learned about manufacturing is that the Like many Kickstarter projects before us, our self-imposed deadlines came and went. Lots has been written about why this is, but the best explanation I’ve ever heard is that the kind of eternal optimist needed to launch a product off the ground must possess near super-human levels of self-denial when faced with the cold reality that they’re in over their heads.It’s a risky business.We kept talking with our backers. They kept cheering us on. Early on we learned that the more you communicate, the better off you are. This is really scary because oftentimes the thing you end up communicating is: “we’re sorry, this was harder than we thought.” Every time another week went by, we would compose our progress report and they would cheer us to the finish line. That forgiveness and understanding is a huge part of what keeps an ambitious project like this going.I remember when $300,000 sounded like a lot. When you start a company, you quickly learn how little money that actually is. Danielle and I knew that we were never going to be able to make it to our launch date on Kickstarter funds alone. We had been pitching to VC firms since sequestration had killed our funding, but hadn’t had much luck. The old adage about how if you ask for money you get advice, and if you ask for advice you get money is true. We got a lot of great advice.What was different now was that we had proof that there was a market for a portable, easy-to-use mill. We hit the Valley and took our pitch on the road. Some of our backers even became angel investors. Some became employees. Other Machine Company was born, and we were no longer a research project.The first machine that rolls off the line is just the beginning. It’s the start of a journey that changes with each new step you take. We didn’t realize it at the time, but getting our manufacturing strategy in order would be just as much, if not more work, than designing the machine itself. We were going to need outside help.Our plan was to build the plastic frames and metal Z-blocks in our shop in San Francisco, and then have the final assembly, called Launch day finally came as our first machine passed quality control (QC). As each new machine was built, optimism was quickly replaced with panic. Building something once is hard, building it over and over again is considerably harder. During our first few weeks, we were experiencing failure rates of 90% and higher. Every day our engineers would make the long drive to our CM to debug the problems and report back. Were we trying to push the materials too far? Had we just gotten lucky with our prototypes? Quickly we found the source of the problem: the thickness of the sheets of plastic used for the frame varied by almost 13%. Our original design had not compensated for this. If a frame was cut out on too thick or thin a sheet, it wouldn’t go together right.There were other issues. Some machines would fail to touch-off the tool. Bushings would work loose. Frames would warp in transit on their way from our factory to the contract manufacturers. Our packaging had a fatal flaw, and some machines would arrive damaged.To an experienced manufacturing engineer, problems like these might seem laughably avoidable, and yet every day all over the world, entire engineering teams run into more and more exotic variations of this same problem. Nothing in the manufactured world is ever made the same twice. Parts fall within a bell curve. Some are nearly identical, and some are special, unique snowflakes. We were still learning what it would take to make our machine.With the first few machines making it out into the world we were now faced with a brand new challenge. How to support something as complicated as a milling machine? The usual audience for these machines is a highly technical one. Our decision to concentrate on milling PCB boards first was a strategic one. By choosing electrical engineers as our audience, we were stacking the deck in our favor.We made a Some machines made it through QC and failed in the field. We made phone calls, we made house calls, and we got on planes. We fixed every problem we ran into and rolled those lessons learned as quickly as possible into the production line.This is important: your Kickstarter backers are not just customers. They’re your best customers. We had this thing we liked to say around the office: “All we have to do is make 200 people happy.”This is harder than it sounds. With our customer base growing as each new machine made its way out, a new wave of questions would come rolling in. Our documentation was weak, and there was a mountain of it to write. Slowly, we chipped away at it. We still are.In addition to everything else, we now had to learn how to become a media company as well. Each new video would take days to shoot and edit. Each time the content team got faster.Eventually the tide of manufacturing problems subsided and we had time once again to think about the future. What did we need in order to start selling to the public?A simple enough question.With a quarter of our backers based overseas we wanted to be able to export our little machine. To export to Europe, we’d have to pass the strict product safety and certification requirements that come with a CE mark. We would also need to pass FCC Part 15B rules. Navigating the world of Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories, or NRTLs, is a challenging one. There are literally thousands of documents covering hundreds of different product categories. The first thing you learn is, they speak another language. Worse yet, the labs are structured in such a way that they can only tell you what you can’t do. A frustrating experience if you’re not used to the way they work.The tests one has to pass are highly dependent on the market you’re trying to sell into, and the nature of what you’re trying to sell. If you market to the public there are a different set of requirements than if you market to industry.Right off the bat, we hit a wall. What category did our machine fall under? Most of the rules and regulations for CNC machines had been written for the factory floor. In one hilariously frustrating moment talking with an NRTL engineer, they recommended a safety switch to us larger than the entire cutting area of the machine. After three months of meetings we finally figured out how to test the machine. Our designs changed rapidly as we jumped to meet each new requirement. New costs got added to the bill of materials (BOM).During that time, we also started FCC testing in a little 3-meter electromagnetic interference (EMI) test chamber in the South Bay. A family-run business, they were very helpful and friendly. On the day of our first EMI test, I was nervous. If the controller board passed, we could go to market with just an FCC mark. If it failed, a costly redesign. The tests came back. The board was screaming. Our microprocessor was leaking clock noise in every direction, and the unshielded stepper lines bled wideband noise over the lower frequencies. It would need a complete redesign.As we worked our way through the seemingly endless new problems, new customer feedback from our backers kept coming in. People were using our machines to do incredible work, pushing the limits of the original design.On some of the darker days, when everything was falling apart, we’d get an email from an excited customer showing us something new and unexpected. Moments like those are what kept us going.As painful as it is to relive the last year, and share every setback, mistake, and learning experience, it’s also remarkable to see how far our team has come. Were incredibly proud of the tool we have built.We’re also proud of our first machine. Collectively, they have logged thousands of hours, travelled to every continent (except Antarctica), and introduced thousands of people to the world of CNC manufacturing. Our first generation machine was even used extensively to prototype the second generation Othermill.Our customers are using their machines to launch companies of their own. It is our hope that by sharing our story, some of that hard-won experience will help guide these new entrepreneurs along their own journey to the starting line.It’s hard, but it’s worth it.(i make things. i take them apart. i put them back together and write poetry about the left over pieces.

The on-demand economy is not new. Our villages have had them for hundreds of years, when the local hairdresser came home to give you a haircut. These were the opening remarks by VC The modern on-demand services started with the promise of speed and convenience. That’s table stakes now. Zero cognitive load to users combined with a value-added experience is the mantra for new entrepreneurs. Take Sprig for example. CEO daily food inspiration even when they’re not ordering. The on-demand economy has given rise to the ‘Uncollared Worker’, one with all flexibility and no benefits. Supply not demand will be the challenge for growth said co-CEO not just a cog in the cleaning machine. The experience of on-demand services is as much offline as online, and employees are a key interface. Gone are the days of monolithic centralized corporations. Today’s on-demand startups, too quickly might leave you weak. Whether your business is virtual (like Facebook which is network-driven) or operational (like In the future the on-demand economy will expand to all kinds of new verticals from health and wellness to beauty services, personal finance and even government on demand.

(la version en español de Not too long ago, my good friend Assuming you’ve taken the time to read his article, what you’ll find below is an in-depth analysis of what I’ve learned over the past 5 years, building engineering teams and supporting Open Source communities in the US and Latin-America. I used to have a very similar position before becoming an active participant of the Colombian developer community. And, at that time I found that the “engineering deficit” (not just software) in Colombia was a new one. Today the conversation is becoming more mainstream, mostly due to the increasing popularity of technology startups and the more diverse backgrounds of people who want to build them, they are not mostly engineers any more.Publications about this deficit/crisis in Colombia can be found as far back as The best proof I have is the superior level of engineers who have joined the Colombia is a developing nation where academic knowledge and research is not as prestigious as it is in developed nations. It’s difficult to dedicate a lot of time to answer academic questions when more than half of your population is on survival mode. This is shown by the fact that between 1960–2000 only 162 PhDs graduated in all areas of study (1). This amount has Amazingly, in the same period of 2001–2010 there were 108,784 Systems Engineers who graduated (3), making it the degree with the 4th highest amount of graduates in the entire country. Considering that only 24,618 more lawyers graduated than Systems Engineers (4), I quite frankly find that number very impressive. Even more impressive is the fact that an astonishing 39% of graduates were women. From a pure numbers perspective, I struggle to see the deficit.Blaming schools on the lack of Software Engineers is just like blaming the same schools for the lack of Nuclear Engineers. It’s true there are no Nuclear Engineers in Colombia, but not just because the degree doesn’t exist, but also because there is no demand for someone with these skills in the Colombian economy.Let’s go back to the problem Alex, and many others who I’ve spoken to, are facing in Colombia. Their version of a Software Engineer is one defined by the startup culture. They are building tech startups from Colombia, and even when their target market is sometimes local, they are competing against the best engineering teams in the world located in established tech hubs like Silicon Valley (SV). Colombian companies are looking for a very specific technical skills in a talent pool where these skills are not valued.The software industry in Colombia is composed almost in its entirety by two big sectors: enterprise software and software consultancies. When the job market determines what outdated skills are required to be employed, colleges and universities can’t choose to train their graduates on bleeding edge technologies. This happens in all industries, but the speed at which our discipline advances is orders of magnitude faster than others, In Colombia, we have a software industry that is not ready to hire people who are experimenting with Go or Rust (very modern programming languages being developed by Google and Mozilla) because the market we have created of ourselves is not one of innovation. Most importantly, you can’t expect to find a forward looking industry when the organization that tries to promote the trade is actively working with the Colombian Congress on a very So, when the Minister of Technology and related institutions This industry most definitely has a deficit and it’s a problem they have created for themselves. They are not an attractive sector to work for, even after salaries have increased thanks to an influx of foreign consultancies and near-shoring companies. The enterprise software industry in Colombia needs a reality check, better standards and overall employment conditions, if it ever wants to become a competitive sector. I’d say this industry has two problems, one related to marketing themselves as employers and another one related to where they’ve driven the quality of education in engineering schools. It will only get harder for them to attract talent as young engineers realize their skills have a bigger impact if they go to work for small startups, or more interesting companies like Google, especially when there is no significant salary differential.Every day more and more engineers are trading their 9–5 jobs and suits for jobs at startups and modern tech companies. Enterprise software companies, the financial industry and others who depend on their engineering teams have had to keep increasing salaries and bonuses to try to retain their talent. I don’t necessarily think that all startup jobs are much better than the industry, but they are definitely better at marketing themselves and attracting talent, even when there’s cuts in compensation, higher risks and little job security. This is nowhere near happening in our country.I don’t think so, the Colombian enterprise software industry may have a problem with worker shortage, and one that will keep getting worse if they keep coming up with listicles I’m not going to deny startups and new tech companies in Colombia are struggling to find qualified engineers to hire, but this doesn’t mean that because they cannot hire them they do not exist. Their challenge is one that can be broken in two parts, qualified engineer availability and company’s ability to recruit said engineers, let’s look into the first part of this problem.The amount of companies working on innovating software products and technology platforms in Colombia is very limited. Even if you include near-shoring companies working for US clients, the amount of Systems Engineers who have been able to dabble in new technologies and tools, solve complex problems and fail enough to gain meaningful experience is quite small. And, even though I can’t estimate the amount of qualified software engineers, I can give you some numbers for context.Since 2011, Colombia has been able to build the single largest JavaScript community in LatinAmerica. I may not have exact numbers on the size of qualified programmer talent pool, but the fact that we were able to sell out a If we were to assume that no more Systems Engineers graduated since 2010 and we extrapolate some of the results from the 2012 The biggest issue I take with the “there’s no engineers in Colombia” argument, is that it pretty much shits on all the work that a small group of very passionate individuals across different cities and communities have done to create a substantial programming culture and high quality talent pool in the country. All of this during their spare time, without compensation, many times using their own money and for the love of the craft. If your company can’t attract and hire the best engineers, it doesn’t necessarily mean they are not out there. I believe it is more likely that you need to evaluate if you’re really offering the best opportunities for those who you want to work with. You’re probably also wasting your valuable time shifting that blame on our education system, lets leave that to other sectors and the ruling class.The current team I’m working on is the 4th engineering organization I’ve ever hired people for, and even though I’ve been quite lucky finding great people to work with in the cutthroat startup world in the past, this is the first time I feel like I understand 5% of how I’m supposed to do it. What I can see from the obviously reduced context I have, is that in Colombia there’s a great number of job offers, a good amount of PR and buzz on how companies are going to change the world, plenty of talk about investment, lean startups and startup weekends, poor understanding on technical interviewing, a terrible perspective on compensation and benefits and zero understanding of what talented or qualified engineers can do and what motivates them.All of the Colombian tech startups Tech startups didn’t become these great and cool places to work just because they could, cool = spending money. Offering better work environments (Attracting and retaining talent has become much, much harder. Salaries have increased by a lot in established tech companies even with efforts to By being part of a late blooming tech ecosystem mostly imported by SV influenced founders, Colombian engineers get to enjoy 100% of the crappy perks like standing desks (no bacon wrapped cash yet), 0 to 0.3% equity stake even if they’re within the first 10–20 hires, Colombian market level salary (even if you’re at a company with a global market) and most importantly 0% of the engineering culture.Based on personal experience, I’ve found very few people who would rather work for a software consultancy firm than a well-run product driven company, assuming they are fairly compensated. There is an incredible opportunity for building tech companies in Colombia right now. Soon enough, international players will start leveling up compensation due to the great salary differential and if you have nothing meaningful to offer your entire team will leave. I know of a few companies to which this is already happening, and Amazon is The same way companies have their company culture, some of them are able to establish an engineering culture. In some cases these two tend to blend more than in others, and this mostly depends on technical founders or technical leadership, even when the problem they are solving is not inherently technical. Think about Etsy, they breathe engineering culture and yet their core business is arts and crafts.In any case, there’s no such thing as the If it were an easy question we wouldn’t be having this discussion at all, but I can tell you that there’s three main factors I’ve been able to identify all of these companies:If you want to hire engineers for your startup while creating an engineering driven culture (to compete with enterprise companies for talent), make sure you don’t destroy factors 1 and 2 above by pretending to understand software development as a non-technical founder.The perceived simplicity of software development caused by the explosion of the startup revolution makes founders and other non-programming executives/decision-makers feel confident enough to assume they can select technical talent and establish project and software development guidelines.Have you ever assumed to have the necessary knowledge to recruit and tell health professionals, pilots, accountants or lawyers how they do their job? What makes you think you can do so in software and product development? Funny enough, this also happens in the restaurant world, but the reality is that people who are not routinely creating software lack a lot of context in the efforts it takes in producing it. This is also one of the main reasons why restaurants fail so often, there’s more parallels in these two worlds than you’d think.Every time I’ve been involved in efforts where people with no context have tried to take charge of technical development processes there’s been disastrous results. I am appalled at the unfounded assumptions I get to hear during mentoring or product sessions about the simplicity of building software applications, including former programmers turned mediocre managers. Be weary of when you hear “isn’t it Software projects fail when people with a lack of context try to make decisions without acknowledging that they don’t know what they don’t know. When the Sooner or later you’re going to have to actually design and architect your systems while lying to yourself about catching up on the 2/3 of the software you left out. You’ll also have to do this while having to support untested software, real users, a growing company and all the awesome features your biz dev team has already sold. Been there, done that, 3x. Your feature development time can go from 100% to 10% in the blink of an eye, very few companies get to sort things out before running out of money and losers don’t write history.Dear Colombian founder, are you asking to see a candidates Github profile as part of your interviews? Are Open Source contributions something you really value when evaluating an engineers qualifications? Let’s stop for a minute, can you show us yours first? The act of asking for an individuals profile is not wrong per se, what is wrong is expecting people to have a complete record of contributions when these companies have no substantial contributions of their own.Citing my dear friend Alex:I’m sorry, but I have to call you out here Alex. Not because you’re wrong, but because you’re calling developers out while your company has nothing to show for. I’m very aware and thankful for your contributions to the Asking for a Github profile has become more of a common practice, the opinion that The bottom line is, be consistent. If you’re asking your candidates for OSS contributions and developer community involvement, your company should be able to show it’s going the extra mile to support and contribute in all ways possible, and in a selfless manner. Giving or organizing one talk about your own internal implementation, solely for recruiting purposes doesn’t count.Colombia has plenty of technical talent, from my perspective, the real deficit is in companies with high engineering standards and world class engineering mentalities. Companies by founders who have the vision to train, build recruiting programs, understand technical motivation and Open Source dynamics, evangelize and spend real money on putting the “tech” in tech hub.Join me in evangelizing the beautiful discipline of Software Engineering. I’m already in touch with a few schools and have some plans for this year, but if you can put me in front of an audience of  100 aspiring students, I’ll pay for flights myself. Over the next five years I’d like to see at least 5 engineering driven companies come out from Colombia, and in 10 years I hope 100% of Ride’s engineering founding members will have built many more.I’m not a fan of talking about problems without proposing solutions. I do think this post is long enough and have already started drafting a follow up post that mostly goes over my learnings and how you can improve your engineering team’s recruiting, retention, morale and motivation which in the end has a gigantic impact in your business and growth. It will also have a huge impact on our latin-american economy.In the mean time, I can tell you If you’re in a situation where you have urgency or concrete and specific questions about your team’s engineering culture, recruiting strategy, development practices, etc I have a proposal:I will give you 30 minutes of my time in exchange for a $100 donation to Finally, I’d like to thanks (1), (2) — Campo Saavedra, Maria F. “Seguimiento a Los Graduados De La Educación Superior En Los últimos 10 Años.” Ministerio De Educación Nacional, Bogota, Colombia.

We all ask this question. It’s a common conversation starter, especially in the startup community. I’m particularly fond of this topic—I enjoy geeking out about products, writing This was the basis for Product Hunt. Here’s how we prototyped it.The concept was simple: to build a community for product people to share, discover, and discuss new and interesting products. But when I came up with the idea, I lamented the amount of work needed to build a first version of Product Hunt. Even a basic Ruby on Rails app would take me weeks to build. Although confident in my idea, I didn’t It was unusually chilly that morning in San Francisco when I walked to my office, Philz Coffee. I ordered and claimed my usual seat. After unloading my MacBook, I peeked at my to-do list to find something I jotted the previous week:In a burst of motivation to make Product Hunt a reality, I brainstormed ways to build a quick MVP to see if people cared to share and discover products. After noodling over a few ideas, I was reminded of I logged into Linkydink, created a group, and invited a few of my startup friends to contribute. I wrote a quick Within 20 minutes, I had an MVP.I sat back, sipping my coffee, anxious to see how people would respond.Immediately, I received overwhelmingly positive feedback, first from Ash Bhoopathy, entrepreneur-in-action at Sequoia Capital.Then from a partner at Union Square Ventures, Andrew Weissman:And then from Talton Figgins, product support lead, Disqus:Within two weeks, over 170 people had subscribed to product discoveries from 30 hand-picked contributors, consisting of startup founders, VCs, and prominent bloggers. Even more encouraging were the numerous unsolicited emails and in-person conversations expressing their love and support of the project.It’s still very early but these signs of traction are encouraging, especially considering the minimalism of the “Linkydink MVP” and my (intentional) lack of marketing of the product. Granted, I didn’t launch the MVP with a blank slate. Years of blogging, relationship building, and projects like Startup Edition have given me an audience and network of supporters. The term “startup” is deceiving. Successful companies don’t start up overnight; they are founded upon years of experience and help from others that must be earned.The results of the MVP gave me confidence in the idea: I had found something compelling. I began to research technology to build a complete product. Some of my engineering friends recommended Sinatra or Ruby on Rails. Unfortunately, I didn’t have any experience with these frameworks and while assured in my idea, I was still operating with many hypotheses of what the product could be. I wanted something sooner to test my next series of assumptions. I started to look into Sacha Greif’s Yes! Eight days later, we launched Product Hunt.The “20-minute Linkydink MVP” was a great starting point. It allowed me to validate some assumptions very quickly and observe real user behavior without a single line of code. Entrepreneurs often assume an MVP needs to be “built.” The purpose of an MVP is to learn, to Next time you have an idea for a new product or startup, ask these questions before touching a line of code:This lean approach and mentality was used to birth Product Hunt and its ongoing development.Over Thanksgiving break, my talented friend Visit This is just the first post of a series where I will share the strategies, tactics, and surprises we encounter building Product Hunt.

Three years ago I hit release on Now it’s a full time company, complete with an amazing (or ‘totes amazeballs’ as we’d say at standup) co-founder, kick ass employees, office space, customers that pay us money and a lot of fun and laughs.But it’s been tough, really tough. It’s still tough.We aren’t profitable. The founders are still working for free. I’m not complaining, we aren’t owed a wage because we decided to do a startup. We have to earn it, we have a lot of amazing customers, we just need more.Bootstrapping is tough, but so is being VC backed, I’ve done that too.Rewind over 3 years and I was founder of a mobile app startup with some level of traction (we ended up with over 4 million downloads). Our app reviews were painful to track across all countries, but there was so much amazing feedback in them. 5 star reviews that I want to share with the team so we could high 5 each other. 1 star reviews from people that wanted to love the product, but we’d made it hard for them to.It started as a cron job, a little task that would run on my computer once a day and email me the reviews.Then a co-worker asked to get the reviews as well, so I tweaked it to send to multiple emails.Next someone asked me how we handled our reviews, and they wanted in. So I made it into a proper web application, where you could sign up and track your own apps.I sent the link around to 6 developers I knew, to my surprise 5 of them signed up and started using it every day.I didn’t touch Appbot for almost 2 years, somehow people found it and kept signing up. Now and again I’d check back and another bunch of amazing app developers had signed up. Some large companies had over 100 users on Appbot.When Discovr had wound up I took a bunch of time off, luckily I had a number of apps like 7 Minute Workout, Lean Canvas, Affiliate  Realtime making me a decent income.Support started to become a hassle, I tried out a bunch of support products but they all felt like web apps where someone had decided that mobile was a thing and decided they should throw together some mobile support. It was pretty crap.I made AppbotX for my own apps, it was really effective for reducing support and getting better reviews. So I invited a few friends to add it to their apps, they did and gave some awesome feedback.I launched AppbotX in July 2014. Wow, charging money is a different experience all together than having a free product.A bunch of indie devs loved it, and the bigger guys asked why I wasn’t adding it to Appbot.I had this delusional idea that a billion dollar company, with over 100 people on Appbot that were telling me how much they loved the service would want to shower me with money. Unfortunately it wasn’t that easy.Here’s where I knew I needed help, I couldn’t keep going alone. There were major holes in my skill set, pricing, marketing and just someone to bounce ideas off.At the time I had started chatting to Now I have no idea how I did it without a co-founder. Going it alone makes something really hard even harder.Appbot had grown steadily over the years, the majority of users still opened the daily digests. Of course they’d want to shower us with money right?We took a guess at what they would want and built it, unsuprisingly it’s not what they wanted at all.All our best and most loved features have come from talking to our customers.We’ve had to be brave about price testing, even though it doesn’t sit well with us. Lots of people said to us “you’re way too cheap”, but it turns out that there is a hard $ value people will pay for a certain feature set. No matter what your mentors tell you, you can’t just treble your pricing and expect an identical conversion rate.I’ve even had people tell me that pricing doesn’t matter in enterprise. It does (a lot), enterprise customers have to fight even harder to get approval from their finance department.The awesome feeling of getting that first paid user is no different to the tenth, or hundredth. Hopefully when the thousandth comes there will be the same high 5s around the office.The polar opposite of “the new customer high” comes when you have a churn. I definitely have a new appreciation for when a service reaches out after you cancel, that feedback is possibly the most valuable you can get.I hear the stories of startups trying to hire in California and how impossible it is. It’s hard to stay sane in a startup. It’s such a rollercoaster that culture is so important to keep everything levelled.

The legal industry is going through extreme innovation and change, FINALLY. It’s one of the most outdated professional industries. As you’re running your business, there are a ton of resources out there that can help you out on the legal side.

I am the CEO of a startup, and we’re working on some really I’ve had an executive assistant before, but they keep getting promoted into other important roles in our company like sales, product management and human resources. Maybe this will happen for you too, or maybe you love being an EA and we’ll work together for a decade. I’m cool with either one.I used to think an executive assistant was too I need someone to partner with, who can be fully trusted with managing my calendar, my email, my phone, my contacts, as well as coordinating aspects of both my professional and my personal life (one of my cofounders is my husband and I need to make sure to plan dates and vacations with him). I would like to compensate you in the I need you to be in the office when I’m in the office, relieving me of administrative work so that I can focus on responsibilities that come with leading the company. Together, we will navigate a time of incredible growth for the business as well as a great deal of personal growth for me as an executive. It’s going to be a rollercoaster ride.I am doing many new things now that I wasn’t doing a year ago, so I imagine your role might evolve as well. Here are some things I know I would like to entrust you with managing right away:I am pretty brusque, at least day-to-day. Sometimes this might come off as uncaring, but once we’ve worked together for a few weeks I’m sure you’ll see that I care, possibly too much. Let’s be honest, it’s a bit of a shield. I’m working on toning it down but it is somewhat engrained in my personality.I like to give direct feedback, I will tell you what could be better and I will also tell you what is good. I won’t yell or swear, but I will be brutally honest. If this makes you uncomfortable you’re not going to be happy, so you shouldn’t work for me (I mean, I don’t want to make you unhappy!). If this feels like something you’d prefer, then we’ll probably get along.I am not interested in doing anything not directly connected to the goals of the company. You will discover very quickly what I think is important and what I think can be ignored. I will be pretty open with you about things I think are worth our attention, and things that aren’t. For example, I get invited to tons of events and tons of speaking opportunities and you’ll probably find I am pretty dissmive of about 95% of this stuff. It’s not because I have a big ego, it’s just that if I did all of that there would be no time for the research, product design, leadership and other stuff I do internally. It’s weird, it seems like this stuff would be valuable, but doing in-person events doesn’t always scale… so we have to be picky.I’m cool if you’re not my EA forever, but I want someone who will do this job happily and with great focus for at least 1 year. Beyond that, if you discover an aspect of the company you are thrilled about I’d love to promote you into one of our teams and task you with hiring and training your replacement.Together, we will build a company and if you want to learn what it’s like to run a company then I invite you to come run a company with me.I can’t wait to meet you!CEO  Cofounder of 

I used to hate dancing at weddings.I’m tall, goofy, and an awful dancer. Triple threat. Dancing made me self-conscious, so I’d just make some excuse and stay at the table while everyone else had a blast on the dance floor. I don’t remember when or why, but at some point I realized no one cared how I danced. Everyone’s got their own shit. No one was taking bets in the car on the way to the wedding about how low I’d get to “Shout.” So now I dance awkwardly at weddings with everyone else and it’s the best.I also used to hate speaking with customers while I was building a product. I would get this weird, pre-embarrassed feeling — what if people thought my idea was dumb? What if they didn’t need what I was building? What if they mentioned a competitor I hadn’t heard of? What if they didn’t like it? What if they laughed?Your startup begins the first time you speak with your customers and not a second before. If you can’t build something magical, you’d like to figure that out as soon as possible. If you don’t know your perfect customers better than the competition does, you’re cooked.You can’t have fun at a wedding if you’re sitting at your table and you can’t build a meaningful product if you don’t speak to your customers. So now I do both — early and often.We want to walk a mile in our customers’ shoes. To understand how they feel before, during, and after they encounter the problem we’re solving.This will give you insight into the following:You want to know your chosen customer segment well enough to Generally, you’ve spoken with enough customers when answers to questions all start to sound the same.The goal is empathy. You want to be able to put yourself directly in the shoes of your customer. Some questions that will get to the root of their experience with your problem are:This gets brought up constantly, so I’ll close this post with it *jumps on soapbox.*Because the good you can gain from telling people your idea To steal your idea, they’d have to drop everything, catch up to where you are, build a product, launch, get users, etc. It’s extremely unlikely. It’s also impossible if you’re truly building something only you can build.To help you, they’d just have to say “hey — my college roommate is a developer. You should meet her,” or “my cousin would be super helpful — I’ll introduce you.” That conversation will happen And if you still aren’t convinced, It takes a village to raise a child, and a city to launch a startup. Your city is your network. Use them.Posts that help entrepreneurs validate and launch products, from the Tacklebox Accelerator: 

Since starting If I was to create a new startup, here is what I would do:This is undoubtedly a key part, but don’t give it too much focus. If you have an idea, that’s fantastic. If you don’t, try and raise your awareness of the daily activities you carry out. Particularly pay attention in the areas which you are passionate about, because A side point about ideas is that This is very important. If you have an idea, break it down until you think it’s too small to be of value. That’s what you should consider your first version, in fact that’s probably too big too.Another thing to note, is that the idea of a big splash launch is worth questioning. Firstly, to link the big splash with the software being ready is very dangerous, and secondly This is one of the most important steps, and often the one which is missed out almost entirely. A lot of the time, it’s the step that doesn’t come naturally to a lot of people, and that was certainly the case for me. There are, of course, However, there is another crucial benefit to getting feedback, and that is Get feedback to validate your idea, but more importantly I can’t stress this point enough. If you’ve got this far, then you’re doing very well. In my experience, How did you get your startup off the ground? Are you about to start something? I’d love to hear from you in the comments. Also, if you want to bounce any questions off me privately, Founder/CEO  at 

A year ago, I returned to California after working on the rescue team to fix Healthcare.gov. I slept for a couple of weeks, and I began the task of processing what I had seen and done. I knew that Healthcare.gov was the most important work I had been a part of. I saw that technology in parts of the government was in bad shape.But there was hope. When asked, some of the very best engineers and troubleshooters in the world willingly put their lives on hold to dedicate their time to this very difficult problem. When they got there, they found government officials and contractors, who also wanted nothing more than to fix the site and who were ready and willing to work together to make it happen. There was limitless opportunity to do more.In May, we started to talk about creating the So in August, I moved to Washington, D.C., to start the Today, we have a few dozen world-class technologists working at the We kept quiet for a while to see if our ideas proved out, but now it is time to go bigger. Lots of people have asked me what’s been most surprising about my time in government so far—I think they’re expecting me to say the bureaucracy, the Blackberrys, or the curious practice of writing everything in Powerpoint form before printing it and handing it out.But what’s truly been the biggest surprise is how the very best engineers, technologists, and designers are ready to give up the perks of the private sector and work alongside equally talented government colleagues to take on the toughest problems in government. They are seizing the tremendous opportunity we have to transform the way government delivers services to people. They are not discouraged by challenges. They are energized. Mastering technology is one of the greatest challenges facing our government, and our generation is answering the call.Our team already includes the lead developer on Google Chrome, the third engineer ever hired at Amazon, and the former Operations Director at Twitter—all people who had likely never considered serving in government, until they were asked to. And now they are applying their cutting-edge skills to fixing the very services that their friends, neighbors, and so many others depend on.We are recruiting talented professionals like these to form Digital Service teams throughout the government. We are partnering with dedicated public servants to embed these teams into agencies where they can gain traction on mission critical problems that have the most impact on everyday people. We are lucky to already have We’re especially proud of our work at the I don’t blame you if you are skeptical that we can fix the biggest problems in government. I used to be, too. But every day, I am reminded of a quote by President Kennedy that is sewn into the Oval Office rug: “No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings.”We have found the problems. We need the human beings. We are calling on America’s talented technologists to be part of the solution.We hope we’ll hear from you soon.The United States Digital Service is transforming how the federal government works for the American people.

Learning to read financial documents is one thing, but learning to All three indicators are important, but emphasis shifts depending on stage:In the beginning, cash is all that matters because it is the lifeblood of the company. It pays the team, rents the apartment you work out of, gets super-fast Internet access and a lot of snacks from Costco. It’s the printout from the ATM at the Mountain View Safeway that has two commas in it, and you dance around for a few minutes before reality sets in: Managing the cash balance of the company as the most significant high-level financial indicator makes sense in the early days. You take the total bank balance you have, and divide it by how much you spent this month, and that tells you roughly how many months you have left before you run out of money. Maybe you take it one step further and make a simple forecast showing estimated hires and an estimated monthly rent when you move into a real office, but it’s still very simple.After coming so close to death when we shut down Referly and re-launched the company, we managed Mattermark’s accounting on a Each month, we look at the change to our bank balance and ask, We If we collect $1M in cash this month, we can spend $1.4M this month and we’ll have a net burn rate of $400K. If we collect $200K in cash this month, we can spend $600K and have a net burn rate of $400K. While spending $1.4M a month might sound irresponsible if you’ve been reading the news about startup burn rates, in the $1.4M scenario the company is covering 71% of expenses with cash from operations. In the $600K expense scenario, the company is covering only 33%.As long as revenues are growing, burning $400K a month becomes less and less risky over time. Which brings us to our next phase of money: Run Rate.When we started out we were focused on cash because we didn’t have revenue, but as soon as we had revenue growing it was all that mattered. As a newly minted SaaS CEO I diligently studied SaaS metrics, and I was surprised to discover that run rate has different meanings depending on who you’r talking to, and your business model:So far, these two numbers aren’t that different. Annual recurring revenue is 15% higher than annual run rate, based on Q1 performance. Here’s the problem though: I’ve been giving our investors guidance with a goal to achieve $4.5 Million in annually recurring revenue by the end of 2015. And I’ve told them we are only slightly (-3.2%) behind target.Based on our forecast, Mattermark will generate $2.6 Million in The reason for the difference is important: we collect revenue for the entire annual contract up front for about 50% of our customers, but we made an important change at the beginning of 2015 and switched to That means if we sign up a customer for an annual contract and collect $12,000 from them on December 1st, 2015 only $1,000 of that money is attributed to 2015 revenue. The rest is unearned for 2015, and will be spread out over the next 11 months in 2016.To illustrate the point again about why this can get confusing, consider the Annualized Run Rate metric above. Our forecast calls for $962K of revenue in Q4 of 2015, which would give us an annualized run rate of $3.85 Million ($962K x 4). All these statements are true, but which ones are Therein lies the rub.Earlier this week, the Can you see how this confusion might have happened? As we’ve explored, run rate is not the same thing as revenue.Earlier in this post I explained Mattermark’s year-end run rate will be $4.5M but our revenues for calendar 2015 will be $2.6M. Revenue for calendar 2015 will be only 58% of our year-end annual recurring revenue, and that’s great — because it means we’re growing! As the article goes on to explain:Right now we have ~$500K of revenue whose recognition is deferred between next month all the way out to November 2017. I love love looooove deferred revenue, because it’s cash we can use now. It’s non-dilutive financing for operations. It’s great! But it can be difficult to communicate, as the Hortonworks CEO found out.What I didn’t like about this article was the suggestion that we’re doing something shady in reporting these numbers and providing this kind of guidance. If anything “billings”, future contract revenue, annual recurring revenue or whatever you want to call it is a valuable aspect of SaaS businesses that should be shared with investors as it helps create a more complete picture for why a company commands the price it does in the public market. These aren’t wishes and hopes, they’re numbers derived from real contracts signed with real customers.Annual Recurring Revenue of a growing company will always be greater than annual revenue of the current calendar year, and investors who think this is misleading fundamentally do not understand how SaaS revenue works.Going back to our previous analysis, we had several different numbers we could use to offer guidance for Mattermark revenue in 2015: $1.57 Million annualized run rate based on Q1 performance, $1.81 Million based on annual recurring revenue at the end of Q1, $4.5 Million projected annual recurring revenue at the end of 2015, $2.6 Million forecasted revenue earned in calendar 2015, $3.85 Million annualized run rate based on forecasted Q4 2015 performance. All true statements, but which are the Choices choices.How do we figure out what Mattermark is worth at the end of 2015? Let’s assume that Brad had a solid valuation model going into our Series A round. Mattermark was valued at $18.5 Million pre-money at $1.5M annual recurring revenue. That’s 12.3x annual recurring revenue, which lines up with the higher end of the range for SaaS company ARR multiples on exit.If we assume 12.3x annual recurring revenue multiple holds steady, at the end of 2015 we would multiply $4.5M annually recurring revenue x 12.3 = $55.5M, which is 3x the original valuation on the round… a nice markup for our investor, and a healthy position for the company (which conveniently will have 6 months of runway at this point) to consider raising a $7-14M Series B (which would mean selling 10–20% of the company).It’s almost like we planned it this way.Of course growing slower and other exogenous factors (markets, multiples etc.) could change everything in this projection of the future, but it at least checks out as rational progression.You might be wondering why I didn’t include profitability as one of the phases. It is important, and can happen anywhere along the way depending on choices the company makes about how much to spend and when to pursue break even. As companies grow and mature, the distance from negative to cash flow break-even becomes a smaller percentage of revenue, increasing the company’s flexibility to decide to be profitable.Generally, I think controlling expenses is a lot easier than figuring out how to make more money. So when you do find a way to make money, you should leverage it like it’s an unfair advantage that could end at any time. In a market where capital is available to support rapid growth to claim a market, startups are operating a breakneck speed to claim it!Brad asked me 6 questions via email when I pitched him our Series A back in October 2014. The 6th one was: Still sounds like a pretty good downturn plan to me.CEO  Cofounder of 

Back in December of 2013, a Except that this talk shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise.Many of us have mistakenly underestimated the multiple, giant leaps of faith from Lean Manufacturing to Lean Software to Lean Startup. Even Toyota, who is pretty good at Lean Manufacturing by the way, doesn’t find these leaps Let me explain.However, one of the main reasons you haven’t heard much about Toyota navigating these leaps is that they’re going Corporations launch new products and services all the time, usually with their logo on it, to much pomp and circumstance. Multiple media outlets trumpet well placed praise or scorn as thousands (if not millions) of people rush to check out the next big thing. If it has your brand on it today in the world of social media, it has to be perfect.It has to be As These public, on brand launches also include months of signs offs, and re-sign offs from branding, marketing, legal, and well, you get the idea.And yet the aftermath of such a public, on brand launch for something new is often a painful slog of finding a signal in all of the noise. Much of it circling around one burning question.Toyota, like many corporations I advise at Corporations do not lack ideas, but rather have a hard time deciding on what ideas to invest in. One of the ideas Toyota had recently was around gas payments.Instead of building for several years with a large team and launching gas payments on brand, Toyota quickly registered a new domain, created Facebook Ads and drove traffic to an off brand landing page to test their value proposition.Once the landing page had a steady stream of traffic, initially spending only $100 a day, the team kept conducting problem and solution interviews with potential customers. This included those recruited off of craigslist, approached at gas stations and even those who signed up on the landing page.In this case, getting out of the building meant recruiting people off of They learned a lot, specifically about their value proposition.For instance, their MVP wasn’t any faster than getting out of a car and paying for gasoline the existing way.

G: Contrary to popular belief, artists G: I freelanced for a while after college, and was otherwise unemployed for almost year. The job search process was one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had. My friends were all employed almost immediately after graduating, many moving to different parts of the country and having the time of their lives (from what I would gather from their social media highlight reels).At Berkeley I had majored in psychology, later adding Art Practice under my belt as well. The former I chose out of interest and practicality, thinking it would be a great foundation for various careers even if I didn’t know what I wanted to do for the rest of my life (the first mistake — thinking I had to stick to one thing forever). The latter I chose because art has been such a huge part of my life growing up, and it was really something I couldn’t imagine my life without. The classic head versus heart, so I did both. But post graduation, I had grand dreams of snagging a digital art job at a major film company. Though that is still a great dream and a goal I want to move toward, the reality, in my experience, turned out pretty differently.It was an endless cycle of not having enough experience for the jobs I wanted, and no one to hire me to get the experience I needed. It was a pretty horrible time. In a funny turn of events, it was actually Polarr who reached out to me on AngelList.The best advice I got was to figure out what I really loved to do, and do it. If you pour your heart into something, people will see it. So I started an Instagram account called I don’t mean it’s a cushy job or lifestyle, but it turned out to be perfect as my first full-time job, lucky for me. At Polarr, art and photography intersect, and as the first person on the team to focus on the creative and artistic side of things, I have a lot of freedom deciding what direction the company goes. As a relatively new startup, this opportunity has also given me insights into being an entrepreneur, the other side of the hiring process, and really being scrappy and making things happen. Being a tech company, my time so far at Polarr has opened my eyes to a whole other realm of design (UI/UX) that I had not really delved into before, and it has challenged me to think of ways art can interact in technology.In college, most of my art background had been in the traditional sense, drawing, painting, screenprinting, etc. Most of my graphic design had been self-taught, and though I had picked up a few freelance gigs here and there, it never gave me a sense of what it’s like working at a tech-centered company.I put on a bunch of different hats in terms of tasks and roles where I can inject artistic inputs or designs. I’m no expert in graphic design, but I’ve found my background in both traditional art and psychology have been immensely helpful in discussing what looks good, or what people will respond to best. I’m always learning and being challenged, and teaching myself new design or editing skills through my projects. Mostly, I’m grateful for a job where I can draw and design all day, dabble in social media, and connect with cool new artists and makers.P: G: Even now, the majority of our team consists of software engineers and it can be tough finding a way to navigate through pages of conversations revolving around code to see where an artistic opportunity might present itself. Oftentimes I find it easier to reverse the process and come up with projects first, then present it to the team to find out ways something can be achieved, and if not, how it can be tweaked to the strengths of all of our skills. If I find a project I really want to do, or even something crafty I want to try, there is always a way to make it relevant to the company’s needs.My most recent project was pitched, refined, and ready to be implemented in less than a week. That’s pretty amazing for a small team like ours that’s already busy working on a million other things everyday, and it’s awesome to be able to create at such a fast pace. The project in question brought together ideas from different disciplines, from social psychology and art, to computer science and engineering for the website and logistics. The idea is to send various polar bear plushes around the world, have them hitchhike their way through different countries while having their adventures photographed with the hashtag #wanderbear. Hopefully they do find their way home through the kindness and interaction of strangers.G: Well, when I was younger my parents enrolled me in piano lessons, like many parents do. But when they discovered that I had a knack for drawing and crafts, they enrolled me in art lessons as well (and they also realized music was perhaps not my forte). That was maybe when I was in the second grade. Art has definitely played a huge role in my life since then. Of all the extracurriculars I did in school, art is the only thing that has stuck with me until now. I’m really thankful my parents didn’t let me quit, and even more thankful that they supported me majoring in art and going after art jobs even though it’s not always the most practical or financially stable. I honestly cannot imagine what I would be doing now without art and creativity being part of my life and job.G: I don’t really remember what I wanted to be when I was a kid. But I loved to read, and still do! Storytelling is a major theme in the art I make, and want to make, and the things that really inspire me. When I was a kid, I’d imagine an “art career” as someone painting or having their work displayed in a gallery or museum. I still struggle to call my work “art”, because they’re really just fun doodles, designs, or projects I love to do, and I still have this crazy idea in my head sometimes of what art is or should be. I’m still discovering there’s much more to art than paintings hanging on museum walls. It’s everywhere! Back to your question, in junior high I wanted to go into the magazine industry, then in high school I thought more about photography and videography, which then led me to the movie industry and creating concept art for animated films.I love the idea of creating a whole new world and bringing a story to life. It’s an amazing feeling when something you create echoes the human experience in a way that people of all ages can understand and feel. So I guess my idea of an art career has really evolved over the years and has never been quite concrete, but I knew I wanted to do something creative that would be fun for me and also bring out emotions in people.G: I’m definitely influenced by trends. When you make something with your own hands, it’ll always reflect your own style, even if it’s only in the nuances. So even if I am referencing contemporary styles of illustration or design, there’s always a difference in the final product. I’ve found that trying different art styles has only added to my own experience and self-discovery through my work. One of the biggest things I learned was to stay open-minded and never be afraid of erasing something completely and starting over. If we’re talking about contemporary trends, I’m most influenced by that in my photography and editing style.But even in everyday things, when I see something cool I still think, “What if I did something like that?” Then I’ll go back and try it out, and work off of what I come up with. If it works it works, if it doesn’t then it’s totally fine. I never feel like trying something new in my work is a waste of time, because you never know what you might come up with in the process.G: I actually never studied art history until college, and I loved it. There were so many aspects of art and why something was made a certain way (if there is a reason) that I never really thought about before. I don’t really have a particular artist that is my absolute favorite, but I do love impressionist and plein air styles of painting. There’s something really special about capturing a moment and emotion with just a few strokes of color, or just a few simple movements.People can underestimate the power of simplicity. I also love some artists I’ve found on Instagram in the past year who draw quirky illustrations and make amazing artwork, some of which have been creative inspirations behind my G: I think @dailyswoodles was really successful because of its consistency (before I started working at Polarr). I had a theme going with the paint swatches and ink illustrations, and took pictures of them in the same way, and captioned them with a related quote or excerpt. People like consistency and familiarity. And good lighting never hurts. I actually spoke to a bunch of artists on Instagram back when @dailyswoodles was still going strong, and they also told me that posting great content consistently is key. Not just for the sake of gaining followers, but keeping people (and yourself) interested in the work. For my personal Instagram, G: A lot of people have asked me how to land a design job, but honestly, I was pretty lucky. In general I would say to work on your portfolio and really show that you have a passion for whatever you want to do. It’s great to have a wide range of skills in various art/design projects, and to show your process in why something is designed or made a certain way. It’s also useful to have a somewhat relevant background in tech, like learning how to code and building a simple website, or at least an interest in learning that side of things.Most importantly, show your enthusiasm and passion in your work. You can really tell how much thought someone has put into a project, and it’s also cool when someone is able to inject a little bit of themselves into their work. Your portfolio should not only show the things you’ve made, but also reflect a little bit of yourself and why you would be an asset to the company. Be consistent, continue building up a body of work, and keep your head up! There are always opportunities if you’ll take them.G: I wouldn’t say my portfolio is great or perfect in any way, but I’ve seen many good ones. A good portfolio should show your range of skills and breadth of interests and expertise. Keep the layout straightforward and easy to navigate (if it’s a website). Besides an artist statement, describe concisely what you’ve done for each project next to the pictures. Speaking of pictures, if you’re photographing your work, make sure you have good lighting and a clear picture. Have consistent sizing, you don’t want to upload a super high resolution image and have people spend more than a few seconds waiting for it to load, because most likely a recruiter will just scroll past it in the time it takes to load.I like finding a personal touch, such as a blog, if I’m looking at someone’s portfolio, but make sure if you include a blog or social media account that it’s something you would want your future employer to see. An excellent portfolio I’ve seen was coded by the person herself, and had a diverse range of projects in multiple disciplines, but all stayed relevant and limited to ones that really highlighted her skills. It’s about quality, not always quantity. It’s cool when you can discover things about the artist that they didn’t explicitly say, but you can find through their work as a whole. In the end, you’re trying to find the best way to display the work you’ve worked so hard on. The presentation is just as important as the work, so likewise, put the time into it and show you care.Online Blog of #Polarr. Find us at The Best of Art and Technology

W końcu przyszedł SMS:SMS przychodzący na mojego BlackBerry w niedzielne wieczory zazwyczaj decydował o moim celu podróży i kliencie na nadchodzący tydzień.Pracowałem w jednej z trzech najlepszych firm zajmujących się doradztwem strategicznym.Życie na walizkach. Życie doradcy, w którym tęsknisz za wszystkim i wszystkimi w swoim życiu, poza akruszami kalkulacyjnymi Excela. Luksusowe życie biznesmena-niewolnika, dumnie trzymającego dyplomy ukończenia najlepszych szkół biznesu.Po kilku godzinach snu spotykałem się z prywatnym kierowcą, który zabierał mnie na lotnisko Rzym-Fiumicino, bym poleciał luksusową klasą biznesową do Nowego Jorku. Po przyjeździe meldowałem się do ekskluzywnego pięciogwiazdkowego hotelu i zaraz potem ruszałem do biura mojego klienta.Pensja? Również ekskluzywna. Firma szczyciła się miejscem wśród najlepiej wynagradzających firm w branży.W tym życiu doradcy coś było nie tak. Nie mogłem znieść tego g*wna ani chwili dłużej i pewnego dnia zadzwoniłem do moich rodziców:Moja mama prawie dostała zawału. To nie jest pierwsza rzecz, którą chciałaby usłyszeć perfekcjonistyczna matka po tym, jak zachęcała mnie do ukończenia z najlepszymi ocenami jednej z najlepszych na świecie szkół biznesu.Próbowałem ją uspokoić. Nie ma mowy.Moi rodzice przeszli na emeryturę po latach pracy na etacie na swoich bezpiecznych i nudnych stanowiskach rządowych.Wiedziałem, że pochodząc z rodziny bez żadnej biznesowej przeszłości, trudno będzie im wytłumaczyć moją sytuację, ale nie spodziewałem się telefonu następnego poranka.Dzwoniła moja mama:Nieważne co bym powiedział, nie potrafiłem jej wytłumaczyć, że firma potrzebuje trochę więcej niż jeden dzień, by się rozwinąć.Miałem szczęście mieć najbardziej wspierającą dziewczynę na świecie. W końcu przyszedł czas by podzielić się tą wiadomością z moimi znajomymi, którzy byli zajęci wspinaniem się po swoich złotych szczeblach kariery w luksusowym świecie korporacji.Powiedziałem wszystkim, że właśnie rzuciłem pracę by spełnić moje marzenie o startupie. Niektórzy z moich znajomych stopniowo przestawali się ze mną widywać, ponieważ prawdopodobnie myśleli, że jest ze mną źle, skoro rzuciłem już drugą „wymarzoną” pracę w krótkim czasie.Mimo, że reszta moich znajomych okazywała wsparcie, w naszych relacjach dało się wyczuć coś złego:Za każdym razem gdy spotykałem się z tymi znajomymi, nie miałem do przekazania zbyt wielu nowych informacji w odpowiedzi na ich powtarzające się pytania, takie jak „Jak tam firma? Zostaniesz następnym Zuckerbergiem, nie?” „Chłopie, jesteśmy z ciebie tacy dumni, jesteśmy pewni, że dostaniesz dużą rundę inwestycji.”Prowadzenie startupa to długa podróż, a ja nakładałem na siebie zbyt wielką presję, właśnie przez martwienie się tym, co myślą inni ludzie.Z dnia na dzień stawałem się coraz bardziej samotny i depresyjny, bo unikałem moich znajomych. Mój startup nie rozwijał się tak szybko, jak oni to sobie wyobrażali i miałem dość tłumaczenia ludziom, że potrzeba było lat, by startupy takie jak Facebook czy Twitter dotarły do tego miejsca, w którym są dziś.Czułem się komfortowo jedynie w pobliżu moich przedsiębiorczych znajomych. To prawda, tylko przedsiębiorca potrafi zrozumieć przedsiębiorcę.Jakby presji społecznej i samotności było za mało, spotkałem się z matką wszystkich stresów: pieniądze kończyły mi się znacznie szybciej niż myślałem, przez co nie mogłem być produktywny i podejmować odpowiednich decyzji. Panikowałem i pracowałem w pośpiechu, by szybciej odnieść sukces i zarabiać pieniądze.Pewnego dnia poprosiłem moją dziewczynę o parę centów, bo nie miałem pieniędzy na butelkę wody. Nie wiedziałem, że to dopiero początek tak trudnego życia, pełnego wzlotów i upadków…Koniec dramatu — od tego czasu upłynęły ponad dwa lata. W tej chwili piszę tego posta w pięknym ośrodku wypoczynkowym w Phuket w Tajlandii, sącząc mojito.Nie myśl, że ci wciskam kit. Nie, nie zostałem założycielem startupa, który dorobił się milionów.Bycie freelancerem zapewnia mi stałe źródło pieniędzy, dzięki którym mogę podróżować po świecie i pracować w każdym miejscu zaopatrzonym w Wi-Fi.Jest pięć rzeczy, o które chciałbym siebie zapytać zanim zacząłem tę bolesną przygodę. Pięć pytań, które moim zdaniem powinien sobie zadać każdy przyszły przedsiębiorca zanim podejmie pierwszy krok w stronę założenia własnej firmy:Jeśli masz przyjaciół i rodzinę, którzy nie prowadzili biznesu, nigdy nie zrozumieją co próbujesz osiągnąć, a presja społeczna będzie jeszcze większa.Tak bardzo zależało mi na tym, co myślą o mnie inni ludzie — tak bardzo, że zniszczyło mi to życie.Wymagałem od siebie za dużo i nakładałem na siebie jeszcze większą pracę, bylebym mógł jak najszybciej obwieścić sukces. Tak było do dnia w którym zdałem sobie sprawę, że nikt nie zwraca mnie uwagi, więc dlaczego miałbym się nimi przejmować?Jesteś nie więcej niż kilkoma sekundami uwagi, którą ludzie przywiązują do statusu na Facebooku. W 2014 r., w tak zatłoczonym i głośnym świecie, nikt nie ma czasu na innych.Jeśli za bardzo przejmujesz się tym, co myślą inni, zmarnujesz swój czas próbując im udowodnić, że coś potrafisz, zamiast skupić się na twoim startupie.Żyj pełnią życia. Ja zacząłem dość późno.Gdy dorastamy, dzielimy coraz więcej naszego życia z naszymi partnerami niż z rodziną i znajomymi. Mając tak wspaniałą dziewczynę, smutno było mi patrzeć jak moi przedsiębiorczy koledzy zrywali ze swoimi dziewczynami.Zarządzanie własnym biznesem jest trudne — znacznie trudniejsze, niż sobie wyobrażasz. Twój umysł jest całkowicie zryty tysiącami rzeczy dziejącymi się w środku i żadna inna osoba, również twoja dziewczyna, nie ma żadnego pojęcia co się tam dzieje.Jeśli nie jesteś singlem, upewnij się, że twój partner rozumie, że czasami można nie mieć ochoty nawet na pocałunek.Tak, na zwykły, prawdziwy francuski pocałunek.Teraz pomnóż tą kwotę co najmniej razy trzy, bo twoje oszczędności będą się kurczyły znacznie szybciej niż to sobie wyobrażasz. Po drodze spotkasz wiele ukrytych kosztów — wynagrodzenie dla księgowej, konsultacje prawne, zepsute iPhone’y czy PC-ty itp.Przygotuj się na mniejsze mieszkanie, mniejsze porcje jedzenia, albo na liczenie każdego centa, coś o co nigdy wcześniej nie musiałeś się martwić.Ostatnie miesiące przed wyczerpaniem się pieniędzy będą szczególnie trudne, a presja będzie rosła tak szybko, że nie będziesz mógł dobrze spać.Sukces przyjdzie powoli, a pieniądze wyczerpią się szybko. Graj mądrze — planuj od pierwszego dnia.Po ucieczce z korporacyjnego świata myślałem, że w końcu będę spełniał swoje marzenia pracując gdzie tylko sobie wymarzę — dopóki nie przeczytałem tego cytatu Lori Greiner:Wszystko zaczęło się w czasie krótkich przebudzeń w środku nocy. Początkowo było to spowodowane nadmierną ekscytacją moimi pomysłami, których miałem tak wiele. Po prostu nie mogłem doczekać się poranka i dalszej pracy.Potem przyszła faza wyolbrzymiania. Pracowałem za dużo, bo nigdy nie miałem dość pracy nad moim pomysłem i zawsze chciałem robić jeszcze więcej. Lecz im dłużej pracowałem, tym później chodziłem spać, przez co coraz trudniej było zasnąć, a jakość mojego snu pogarszała się.W efekcie w każdym tygodniu miałem dwa lub trzy dni, w których moja produktywność spadała prawie do zera.Nie daj się nabrać temu zdjęciu z Instagrama. Nie daj się nabrać rozdmuchanym wiadomościom sponsorowanym o założycielach startupów stających się milionerami.Ich historie są tak naprawdę wypełnione wieloma ciężkimi dniami, nieprzespanymi nocami, ciągłymi odrzuceniami i porażkami.Droga do sukcesu jest długa. Bardzo długa. Bardzo często zbyt długa.Każdy z nas ma różne priorytety w życiu. Dla większości ludzi najważniejszym priorytetem na liście są pieniądze, a dla innych zachowanie balansu pomiędzy pracą a życiem. W konsekwencji ludzie różnie definiują sukces.To jak ciężka będzie twoja biznesowa przygoda zależy od twojej definicji sukcesu. Jeśli pieniądze i sukces publiczny będą dla ciebie najważniejsze, najprawdopodobniej przeżyjesz trudne chwile w swojej podróży.Zapamiętaj mądre słowa Hemingwaya:Przedsiębiorcy, którzy odnoszą sukces, to niekoniecznie ci, którzy zgarniają miliony podczas rund inwestycji. Nie zapominaj, takich jak oni jest jeden na milion.Lecz są tysiące marzycieli, którzy starają się przyśpieszyć sukces swoich startupów lub żyć na poziomie, lecz nawet oni nie są w stanie dostać się na pierwszą stronę portali technologicznych.Niezależnie od tego jak trudna będzie twoja przygoda albo jak bardzo zje*ie ci życie, ciesz się nią i podążaj za swoją pasją. Jak to perfekcyjnie ujął Tony Gaskin:Napisz do mnie na Facebooku: Możesz również dołączyć do mojej podróży: Obserwuj Medium Polska na your friend Nasze historie i pomysły

I heard this pitch as a judge at a startup competition. There are many reasons I disliked the idea. Here are three:(1) There are huge—almost certainly insurmountable—logistical issues in picking up and dropping off (not to mention transferring) packages.(2) This is an awesome service…for transporting drugs. It’s decentralized, essentially impossible for anyone to regulate package contents, and certain to be shut down by the authorities.(3) The usual “collaborative consumption” story (e.g. If any of the “founders” pitching The People’s Parcel had any experience in shipping packages (or anything like it), I doubt they would have spent more than 20 minutes on it before throwing the idea out. However, this was As a pedagogical tool, Startup Weekend is fantastic. It’s fun, it’s collaborative, and it’s hard not to learn something about starting a business. But as a cultural movement, from The best startup pitch from that competition—in my opinion—was a meal-planning service (like And it’s amazing to me that even when recent graduates To quote Mr. Lebowski: “My advice is to do what your parents did; get a job, sir.”Founder and Chief Technology Officer @ BuildFax; Contributor to The New Stack

I am 100% convinced that the incubation model in Africa is fatally flawed as a method of creating big software companies. Of the 9 biggest software startups in Nigeria, none was built by an incubator (Konga, Wakanow, Iroko, Paga, DealDey, Jobberman, Cheki, PrivateProperty, Nairabet, Nairaland).Of the 15 next biggest software startups after the above, the only one that came out of an incubator is BudgIt, and I’m not sure that BudgIt was properly ‘incubated’, all I know is that they used to operate from CcHub.Incubators just don’t work, otherwise they would have produced more successful startups in Nigeria. Even Kenya and Ghana that have a stronger incubator scene have produced nothing of note.The reason I believe they do not work: Incubation attracts the wrong kind of founder. The type of founder who wants to be ‘taught’ how to build a startup, and who is willing to show up daily at the incubation center to be ‘incubated’, is someone that is far away from the grit and problem-solving ability necessary to build a startup that works.To build successful startups, the people who want to incubate have to focus on attracting the type of people who can build successful startups. The pitch that they will be ‘mentored’ is not attractive. One does not want mentorship, one wants information. The so-called mentorship where some guy comes and tells his life story does not help you in knowing how to manage your taxes.A successful startup group has to bring together smart people who can bond and exchange information, then get out of the way. There is far more value in talking to fellow founders than in anything else. The smarter the other founders around, the more knowledge one can get and the faster one can move.If incubator groups want to help, then when startups need information on particular topics (e.g marketing or HR), they should be able to access it and avoid making mistakes.To me, incubators that can never work are ones that select ‘teachable’ people, then bring in a bunch of ‘experts’ to show them how to do things. The incubator then forces the startups to pivot to particular things (that the founders may not be knowledgeable about). The incubator then makes the founder discuss every key decision with the incubator owners. I cannot imagine a scenario where this works.A working ‘incubator’ is one where they focus on finding the very best founders, giving them lee-way to figure things out, looks bi-weekly at growth metrics, has equal-partner discussions with the founders, and has people in place to show the founder specific technical things (e.g finance, hr, marketing etc). So more like an accelerator than an incubator.I’ve seen the scene first-hand for a while now. I’ve seen what is working and what is not. You can’t teach someone to become a founder, stop trying. When he/she is ready, he/she will be ready. Focus on finding the people that are ready now, and just need capital and some key knowledge to move things to the next level.Software developer from Ikot Ekpene, Nigeria.

“Yeah, I just stare at my desk; but it looks like I’m working. I do that for probably another hour after lunch, too. I’d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work.” — Peter Gibbons, Office SpaceFor whatever reason, explaining this to my high school friends gets two reactions: confusion or their head exploding.I’ll say it here in plain English —You don’t need to major in accounting, medicine, or engineering to secure a future — chances are, even your safe options won’t do you justice.It’s a new world out there, and if you’re anything like I was when I was 16, you’re missing out.If you’re not working on projects you care about, you’re risking something that’s greater than yourself. You risk working with people you don’t respect. You risk working for a company whose values are inconsistent with your own. You risk compromising what’s important for a paycheck. You risk doing something that fails to express — or even contradicts —who you are. And then, there’s the shittiest risk of all — the risk of not doing what you want to do, on the bet that you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later.I know, I know.

GO. GET. IT.

That’s a question I’ve wanted to ask hundreds of people over the last twenty years. I would’ve loved to have heard their stories to help me make better decisions when managing my own career. In the last several years, for the first time, many people have asked me that question. And, I’ve been answering it every time, often in person, even when it comes from someone I don’t know, because me five years ago would have done anything to meet me today. But, that approach isn’t scaling well. So, to help the many people who are figuring it out like I was, here’s the short version.But before I tell this story, I have to thank the people who came before me and built this country in which we prosper. One of them is my grandfather, who survived the Holocaust while saving lives, found his way to America, and then literally built parts of this country working construction to support his family. Because of that, I received a great education and could try out a few careers until I found a job that was challenging, fulfilling, and meaningful. I can’t overstate how grateful I am for the opportunities and happiness that I have. I don’t take a day for granted. And, I try to work hard, keep perspective, and give more than I get.And now back to the story…After working at some of the biggest companies in finance, consulting, and advertising, I went to law school and then followed the parade to a big law firm. I planned to work there for a couple of years, repay as much as possible of my $150,000+ in loans, then move on. My experience was better than I expected, so I stayed for longer than I thought I would. During my fifth year there, I decided it was time to transition into something that was more interesting and meaningful, something in a growing business, where I could learn more about the internet and technology, and feel like I’m building something and moving the world forward.Most of my professional experience was in the law, including employment law, so I first tried applying for mid to senior level jobs in law and human resources at startups in NYC. I didn’t really want to be in either of those departments, but I also didn’t want to start over. I figured I’d start there. I’d prove myself. Then, I’d transition.I wrote typical, forgettable cover letters. I attached my resume with good schools, grades, and jobs. An application that I was so sure would make me special. The kind of application I’ve now seen a thousand times.Dear Company, here is a narrative restatement of my resume. Attached please find my awesome resume in resume format. Please hire me. Sincerely, Jared CohenI got the response I deserved: almost none.While I felt like I was getting nowhere, I was actually making progress in a sense. The process of researching and applying had convinced me that I’d be happy and fit in well at a startup. So, I decided I was going to do whatever it took to get a job. I experimented with cover letters and resumes, making them more creative and less typical. And, I applied to almost every entry level job at any startup on either coast. If they had no jobs listed, I applied anyway. I figured I’d prove myself and work my way up.Eventually, I got one.I took an almost 90% pay cut, packed two suitcases, and moved from New York to San Francisco. As I sat in the back seat of the taxi to the airport that morning watching the sun rise, it became very real. I felt like I was watching someone else’s stupid decisions.The first month or so at the job I was reading documents and typing data into Google spreadsheets. But I quickly moved up in the company. I built and managed a data team of twenty people and joined the executive team.I also decided I was going to try coding. I told the engineers, who I had become friends with, that I wanted to learn and had always liked working with spreadsheets. After they stopped laughing, they directed me to Ruby and some resources.I dove in and quickly fell in love with it. I dedicated nearly every spare second to teaching myself about A year later, it was time to move on. I had learned so much. My resume had been transformed. I applied for product and engineering roles in NYC. I even got a couple without too much trouble. I was about to accept one when a friend told me Kickstarter was looking for a Director of Operations. I applied, interviewed, and got the job.My first couple of assignments were to figure out payments so we could expand internationally, and figure out what to do about our shrinking office space. While no one told me to, I also took out the garbage when it was full, killed mice when I could catch them, replaced the doorknob when it was broken, and plunged the toilet when it was clogged. As people began to see me less as the scary corporate weirdo, and more as someone who was sincere and helpful, I started doing so much more in so many areas. It was amazing.In the last three years, Kickstarter built a payments system, went international, bought a beat-up old pencil factory, built a building, and has become a smooth running, growing, profitable company.And, I’ve found a career that’s challenging, fulfilling, and meaningful. My transition is complete.If you have any feedback or questions about this post, please comment or Coming soon: the lessons I learned during this transition and how to do it more quickly and less painfully.TeachersPayTeachers, Formerly Kickstarter.

The first version of a product is months of assumptions based on your intuition for what you think it should look like. Unfortunately, there’s almost always a gap between what you’ve built and what users want, and the majority of product launches result in users signing up and never coming back. This is common, and now you’re faced with an uncertainty about how to advance.Of the startups I’ve helped launch, the most difficult task has always been to take an alpha product and iterate until it begins to find traction. Twitter, Pinterest, and hundreds of other successful startups had rough beginnings. The founders built success through trial and error. You’ve built something, but users aren’t signing up in droves. Now what?Software companies with millions of users and a mature product line have an easy time knowing what to build next — users are sending in hundreds of feature suggestions, data points are easily measured, A/B tests are conducted often, and the team slowly increments the product forward with minimal risk. Pre-product/market-fit startups have a more difficult task with little data to draw upon, and the situation is analogous to an unrelated industry that also deals with a field of unknowns: chemistry.Drug companies research cures for decades in search of answers and employ a framework most of us will find quite familiar: the Scientific Method. The Scientific Method is a framework for dealing with uncertainty and can be applied to both the startup exploration phase and new feature development. I’ve adapted this framework to startups and have aptly named it The Startup Method:Whether you’re a chemist in the lab or an entrepreneur building a product, utilizing a repeatable framework with a fixed process guides you to knowing what step to take next when you don’t know the answer.User stories can result in additions, subtractions, or modifications to the product. As I discussed in Sometimes when ordering a meal at a restaurant, I’ll wonder if a dish is any good. Asking the waiter if he recommends the ravioli, I might hear him say, “Of course. It’s my favorite on the menu!” A different approach would be to ask the waiter which of the three options I’m considering is the best, and his recommendation might change. It turns out he avoids the ravioli and instead prefers the salmon.When you’re asking users for feedback, it’s common to receive false positives because they often don’t know what they want, and they’re not involved in the actual work it would take to make the change. Presenting multiple user stories yields more accurate responses. Users have a chance to prioritize what matters to them most.It turns out your website wasn’t as slow as you thought it was and instead users would prefer a new feature. Gathering user input is crucial, but it’s only helpful if the feedback is accurate.I used to cringe when I would hear recommendations about gathering user feedback from prototypes, but software has improved leaps and bounds over low-fidelity options, such as Once a wireframe or prototype has been formed, it’s time to test it with people and gather feedback. Reaching out to your user base is the best way to gather feedback for user stories aimed at existing users. For new users, it’s a more difficult task. A common strategy is to “get out of the building” and engage in guerrilla user testing. I’ve always found approaching random people in coffee shops uncomfortable and bothersome, particularly if you’re outside of tech meccas like Silicon Valley or New York City where it’s uncommon.A more scalable method is to use a remote testing service, such as Deciding whether to implement a feature is the crux of this process. It’s much harder to decide against implementing an idea you’ve come up with because it often feels as if you’ve wasted your time and failed. There’s also a common misconception: unless you’re building, you aren’t making any progress. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Apple’s recent advertising campaign explains why: “There are 1000 no’s for every yes.”Another challenge is when you’re excited about a feature and you’ve received great feedback from users, but it might not be the right feature to implement During each phase of a startup, there is only With the golden age of design upon us, users have the highest of expectations when it comes to product launches. You’ll certainly hear complaints if you don’t have beautiful, retina-optimized graphics, an expensive demo video, and a polished, responsive website that supports Google Glass. However, iteration is the antithesis of perfection. It’s important to avoid such details until you’ve found a strong signal from users that you’re on the right track. Only when you start to see users coming back to the product should refinement, polish, and growth become priorities.During the exploration phase, keeping a small sample size is crucial for allowing quick development. Supporting the smallest viable user base encourages the freedom to make drastic changes on a regular basis, remove features, support only a few browsers, and deal with minimal customer support issues.Senior Product Manager at Weebly.

I’ve always been a man with many hats. Hacker, Hipster, Hustler — I’ve done it all. The following is the story of how I’m trying to validate an exciting idea I came up with my partner in crime — Skim is a content browser for adventures in your city. We curate activities for our users every weekend, so they can meet more often. Think of Skim asSo while Pritesh and I are hacking up our Now, if you’re a newbie growth hacker or just an idea-preneur sitting on the fence, I hope this blog helps you take the plunge towards floating your idea out there for validation. The Best Part — It doesn’t take much to do it! Here’s how I’m doing it — while being really cheap!It took me really not too much time to design and develop a cool signup website — A few days tops! This was partially because I am an Interaction Designer in my day job and have done Web-dev back in my college days.Onwards.So now that I had build my website, I needed some real photos to explain my idea. This is really important to gain trust with people visiting your ‘idea’ website by looking like a legit product.One look at the price tag on iStockPhotos and I was scampering away from there like Bilbo Baggins from Smaug in The Hobbit!How did I manage to be cheap here? Glad you ask.Here is a great resource by Dustin Senos on ‘Now that I had completed my shiny new HTML website it was time I found a reliable place I could host it for free.Enter Parse is by far the greatest backend service for all kinds of apps. Also, they have a really liberal ‘Free’ tier in their pricing plans. A million API requests a month!!? Talk about Freemium.So since we were already using Parse in our app’s MLP, I decided to give hosting our website on Parse a try. To my surprise, it worked like a charm. All I needed were a few terminal commands and I was already atHere is the But there was a problem (Yes, like always) — unless I paid for the pro account at $200 a month, my url would look like…Bummer!I couldn’t possibly go live with a URL, which screamed of my free loading on Parse! And, I could never afford to pay for a service that expensive! How would I get that cool custom domain then?Since I needed a domain name anyways I went over to GoDaddy, to grab mine. So finally our website was christened — getSkim.co and I shelled out But I still needed to hook up this domain name to my Parse website. And get rid of that ugly parseapp.com domain hanging on Skim’s tail for dear life!Here’s how I did it, and did it for free!There is a simple option that every domain registration service would provide with each domain they sell you. It’s called This trick is really simple and straightforward, and It comes with it’s own drawbacks.But these are drawbacks I can easily live with… for now.Now all Skim needed was an email engagement tool for my shiny red Call-to-Action button on the website. MailChimp fit the bill perfectly! Plus, they had a really good free tier of up to 2000 subscribers and 12k emails per month. Enough for creating my little mob of Skim enthusiasts!All I had to do was create an honest and personal copy for my emails, redesign some html on MailChimp’s design tool and setup a simple forwarding email to Skim’s Gmail account on GoDaddy. The one you get for free with each domain.Done.I’m also growth-hacking my early user mob registrations. I’ve realised how simple gamification techniques can be really powerful for signup conversions. More on this in the next one.Till then find me on Designer Reviewing cool startups and ideas every week!

In the last year, It’s clearly a developer’s market, yet startups aren’t improving their recruiting/interviewing tactics. Many of these tactics are a turn-off to the best talent and will cause them to reject your offer or to stop in the middle of the process or will cause you to erroneously mis-categorize candidates as unqualified. I’m not an expert in startup recruiting but I have been interviewed plenty and talked to enough developers to put together a list of things developers do and do not like to see. Some of these points will seem obvious but they only made the list if multiple people found it to be a recurring problem.Before you start the interview process, screen the candidate by talking to your network, checking out their Github, personal website, etc. Here’s how things should go once you’ve decided you’re interested in a developer.So, what do you think? Is there something I missed? Am I completely wrong? Previous 

If we’re friends, Facebook friends, follow each other on One of the things I absolutely love about 500 is the fact that they are unabashedly all about the underdog. And, frankly, I’m down with that. For one thing, I’m not your typical startup founder. I’m 43 years old, I’m female, I’m not technical, and oh yeah: I’m not a stereotypical startup hottie either. Well, unless you like a little (or a lot of) extra cushion. Not that there’s anything wrong with that!). So the fact that this organization—which is the real deal, I might add, having something north of $73M of invested/investable dollars—is so blatant in their Another thing I love about 500 is that in the course of building a shockingly contrarian, anti-Valley-bro brand and ecosystem, they have not only embraced but sought out female founders. 500 Startups has been in existence for only 4 years, but in that time they have Last but not least, I gotta say it. A lot of people make “that face” when they hear the name So it is with some degree of excitement that I announce that So what is it really like, being a female founder at 500 Startups? First and foremost, I want to say that I came into this experience with some firsthand knowledge of the 500 team, but by no means was I prepared for what I walked into. Before we got here, I thought I “got” the whole 500 startups thing…”Dave’s crazy, we’re going to yell Yes, Dave’s crazy. Yes, we talk about AARRR (a lot).But it was instantly and irrevocably obvious from the first moment that we stepped through the grey door that this is a FAMILY. You know the saying, it takes a village? Well, 500 has built a huge village, and it’s packed full of incredibly talented, amazing people who are so generous with their time and expertise that I actually occasionally have to shake myself to believe it. The 500 team isn’t just Dave, by the way: there are a huge number of awesome people who make this machine go, who are just as fantastic and add just as much value to the startups every single day. Some of them are the 500 team, many of them are the mentors, and of course the founders of previous #500Strong companies.Special shouts out to But what about all the other startups we’re tossed into the fire with?

Folks, we have a big problem. Women and girls everywhere are missing, underrepresented, and dropping out from technology fields. As a result, today’s tech — and increasingly today’s world — does not reflect the diversity of women’s experiences or ingenuity.It doesn’t help things that only 7% of all investor money goes to women-led startups. We need to change the statistics, the tech sector is missing out on startups and products that could be world-changing.One way that we can change the ratio is by actually funding women-led startups. We can make sure that when we’re investing in startups, they have women on their management teams. We can start calling for more women CEOs.

As both a startup person myself and the At the beginning of this year I launched a new However, in comparison to my husband Recently, however, he’s started to change the way he works. He has a new startup and has had a chance to create a new way of working and a different startup culture in his company. As I have been struggling at home to Last week he wrote about This is a huge change and a massive positive step away from the pattern of the past few years when he wouldn’t be home until 9pm or 10pm on a good day. And we are enjoying a lot more family time together at weekends too, which is a very wonderful thing. There is some definite away from the office time and to some extent an off-switch for his main work projects.But for the majority of the time the hacking, making, reading, planning, doing, creating continues once he’s home in the evenings and at the weekends. He still gets up in the middle of the night to make things. He’s rarely away from his laptop or phone. And he is often ‘in the zone’ and definitely not ‘in the moment’ of being at home. This is not a criticism (although, yes, sometimes it does of course drive me crazy) but it’s all part of the startup personality. The energy, drive, passion, belief that is all a part of what he does, and indeed what we both do, is really hard to turn off.If you have an idea (and there’s always an idea) then it’s very hard to just think “that’s a nice idea” and then go and watch a film or something and not actually do anything about it. I guess there are plenty of people that can do that but we can’t. In the past I worried that we’d run out of ideas. Part of startup life is accepting that lots of stuff won’t work out, things will fail and learning that this is ok because there is always the next thing. And, I’d sometimes think “what if there’s not a next thing?” What I’ve learnt is that new ideas, plans and things to come, and they come because we’re always thinking, playing, creating, doing. Always switched on.But is there a danger in all this being on stuff? Can you burn out? Aren’t you supposed to take a holiday? Rest? Turn off? Yes, there have been times for both of us when we’ve burnt out a bit. And I think as we get a bit older and wiser, we are learning when we need to slow down a bit, say no to a few things and take the pressure off. Stef’s new working hours are a definite step in the right direction of preventing burn out and looking after himself.I don’t think the startup ‘always on, go, go ,go’ thing is a bad thing if you learn to manage it. We have four little people that are brilliant at bringing balance into our lives. Our children are the best people at making us stop all this work stuff and help us to channel all this energy into family time. They help us to Bringing up children also regularly makes us think really hard about things; discipline, education, moral compass, and so many other big things. Being together as a family is a way that we can turn the startup switch off, while still using the things that drive our startup spirit. The energy, passion, ideas, creativity are all brilliant things for bringing up children.I think what I’m learning from thinking about startup life and startup people is that we can take time off and away from our work but that there is something in us that is always switched onto possibilities, ideas, connections, the startup thing.If we can understand and trust that then it frees us up to be able to stop work at 5.30pm, to take time off to be with our family at weekends and indeed, to do what I am currently doing and taking time out (well almost!) to be with our children while they are young.Knowing that time out can actually provide space to think bigger, clearer,to play, to experiment and fuel the startup stuff later (whenever that may be), is so empowering for people that can sometimes worry about stepping away from the laptop. Startup people, by definition, can’t turn off and it’s important to accept that this is how startup life is. But, it doesn’t have to be all consuming, Photographer, blogger, crafter, mother to four beautiful little children and a start-up wife.

Companies change. Products evolve. Approaches get thrown out the window. The centrifugal force alone of that kind of rapid development is enough to throw anyone off center. Throughout my experience, one guiding rule on team building in fast-moving companies has emerged: It can be tempting when you’re first growing to hire someone specifically to fill a gap in your company’s skillset. If you hire someone for skills alone, however, they may lose balance as the company grows, when those skills are no longer as central or get placed into a different context. Each time I have built a team, personal traits – not professional skills – have been what propelled the company forward.So, what traits matter? The answer is going to vary by company and founder, but I look for the following:Fit is arguably the most important of any qualification. At my former startup This kind of drive is different than traditional ambition. Ambitious people will succeed at any task laid before them. They will personally excel, quickly rising from manager to director to vice president. A scrappy person who is driven does not rely on titles or defined responsibilities. He or she will push the company forward even when no one’s looking. Driven people move through the responsibilities on their lists, but also keep a constant eye on how the company as a whole can do things smarter and better.Intelligence and experience are valuable, but a scrappy person who fits well on the team can learn fast. In a start-up, jobs are always changing. So when you think about intelligence and experience, make sure you are thinking about it in terms of a genuine hunger to learn and level of life-experience that enables the candidate to easily adapt and evolve.Discovering these traits in candidates may come down to a gut feeling for many, but some of it can be illuminated by carefully posed questions and by getting a candidate outside of the typical interview set-up. Whenever possible change the setting, meet candidates outside of the office, at events or out for coffee. Get them talking rather than answering. Find out what it is that makes them tick.—This post originally appeared on CEO at 

30 Mistakes Tech Startups Make….Again and AgainIn my experience of mentoring, investing in, fundraising for, working with and for tech startups (probably 200 or so in total), here are 30 mistakes that I see repeated all the time.While it’s famously hard to learn from other people’s experiences, it saves an awful lot of teeth gnashing if you can. It’s also just as difficult to figure out if any of these apply to you, which is why you should have a generous smattering of independent mentors or advisors to point out the truth (see Mistake 18).1. Not understanding the profound implications of exponential growth and what it will do to your company and marketI’m sure there are others that you can think of, but these were the first ones that sprung to mind in a quick brainstorm and they’re common enough that I see a pattern across many companies – even very successful ones.Maybe I could use these as chapter headings for my next book!Mobsesssed, blogger, Angel Investor, Advisor, Speaker, Singularitarian and Seeker of the New New.

Sad to see Cory Bookers startup Waywire pivoting to My previous role leading product at YouTube put me in position to see a lot of video startups. Additionally, most large developers hit our radar at some point via their API usage. Many of the video curation/discovery startups were based on two hypotheses:These are both absolutely true yet it doesnt matter - video discovery startups are flawed products and even worse businesses. Why? Because they dont fit into a consumers mental model. Theyre fine products - several are very well-designed - and Im sure many user studies provide answers like oh yes, I totally need this, but in reality theres no habit being formed. Heres why:Some believe that native ad models are the solution - that content owners and advertisers will pay to promote their content. YouTube does this via sponsored videos and indeed it does work but requires a scale of both users and operations that these startups can likely not reach.So what would I do? Probably create a great mobile app and a .99 per month subscription service to deliver a handful of curated YouTube videos to you each day. Highly thematic and where context is less important - hockey fights, vegan recipes, kid-friendly videos. It would be a niche business but one I think you could scale by getting folks to subscribe to multiple channels. But dont take venture capital. Just build it.Funding exciting startups via 

But getting real results with inbound can take time and many trials and errors.On the following diagram I’ve tried to sum up a “typical” Inbound Marketing journey that an early stage SaaS might experience. It’s the result of my experience with different SaaS startups, so I don’t pretend it’s universal nor that it covers every aspect of it. Please feel free to send your comments on Twitter (The diagram is structured the following way:You can download the When you first start with inbound marketing, chances are high that you’ll begin with very limited resources (people  money). This is why in most cases inbound marketing equals “a company blog” at that stage, with the founders as the content writers, eventually helped by an intern.There are two huge challenges at that point:Very often we tend to be too “self centered”: speaking about Hence the second stage: disappointment.You’ve put a lot of effort into writing several long form articles with nice pictures, but your traffic is not taking off. And it seems that people are not amazed by your content and not directly upvoting / RT’ing you when you post your article on Hacker News or Twitter. But you’re not dumb, You’ve done your job of reading lots of materials from founders who have Now it’s time to write some great pieces of content and to adapt them a bit to each channel / audience you’re targeting. And since people don’t seem to make the effort to directly upvote / share what you’ve written, a little Slack circle with some other startup friends, where you help each other, will be useful.And the magic happens! You finally manage to generate several thousands views and hundreds of Facebook or Twitter sharings. Congratulations!But soon reality hits you:What you finally realize is that being “hit” driven is actually a very hard to maintain strategy and that every time you’re sharing something you’re dependent upon external distribution channels. You have no traffic “safety net” and every time it’s fly or die.Again, you’re quite intelligent so you decide to stop this madness before you burn out and you decide to reboot your strategy.At that point it’s also very important to say that you’ve probably acquired much more knowledge about your customers, their needs, your industry etc. (because you didn’t spend your whole time writing articles, you’ve also built a product, interviewed customers, tried to sell it…). And, I will never insist on that enough, the knowledge you build from running your startup / selling your product must permeate your marketing effort.So now that you’re not progressing anymore with your content distribution it’s time for a strategy reboot, taking everything that you’ve learned into consideration:If you are well organised and if your narrative really clicks with your audience then it’s time to grow again.

ever.This morning I read a facebook post from a friend about how he has gotten to the point that he realized that his family mattered most to him.He had read a post by The past year or so has been amazing. The issues surrounding depression and entrepreneurship have slowly moved from the dark into the light. We hug more. We look at each other in the eye, and mean it when we ask each other how we are doing. It’s been amazing to be part of this transition.And now it’s time to take the next step.Everyone of us has been lied to. We have been told that the only way to succeed is to put work before everything.If we do that, then one day, we will be able to retire and have fun.Bullshit.By the time we are ready to retire, or hit that elusive exit that gives us F-U money, we are beaten down. Tired, and worst of all, we are strangers to our families and often either find ourselves alone or at the end of many failed relationships.Our lives are not a Field of Dreams where the simple act of building it is all that is needed.So what is the secret? What is the truth?Selfishness.Yup. Put yourself first. Before everything. Before work.Stop for a moment and think. It’s 20 years from now. Maybe 30. What do you want to be known for?

Some people want more money, some people want to be wanted, some people want a higher title, but everyone wants recognition for their work.Startups don’t work in the way that ordinary businesses do, so why would you think moving up the chain would be the same in a start up as in an ordinary business? (or what I like to call an “old-business.”)Millennials tend to have an inherent grasp on this, we have an urge to not hold back, to show what we do, to urge for change, to clean up the clutter and to move things forward.We also have a knack for handling things in-delicately.So here is how to get a raise and earn recognition without getting fired.“Intrapreneurship” is the act of behaving like an entrepreneur while working within a large organization.Owners, executives and managers have one direct goal — to improve the business.They want to see the bar go up, revenues rise and see pronounced profit increases.Find a way to give them that. Even if it’s not your role.Use your personal interests, your personal abilities, your unique assets to grow the business and make it more efficient.How do you do this?Startups don’t have time for “indispensable employees” the moment you keep secrets is the moment you might be eliminated. The way to really shine is to baffle with brilliance.Also to be a little bit more to-the-point Rand says —Provide value to your team, to your bosses, show that you know your role well enough that you can systematize everything you do and are capable of managing it on a broader scale. Guess what that does? That makes you look like less of a grunt and more of a operator.If you want your startup to scale, to grow, to make insurmountable leaps and bounds, you have to make yourself entirely redundant. Everyone at the company has to be redundant. Everyone has to be replaceable, everyone needs to be replicable. If every position is replicable, guess what? That’s scale. That means the company can grow, without pain, without friction. The company can become larger, take on more clientele and potentially reach that large level of success.You want to be a part of that level of success. You want to aspire to it.If you want to find out how to speak the language of your executives, bosses, managers or the like — it’s in revenue.If you can make the case that what you do will help increase revenue, it’s black and white.

Information is your route to higher value.If everyone is doing better work and you’re leading the charge, you’re moving forward.Facilitate self-belief in your peers. If you can be of more worth than you’re expected, so can they. Motivate the people around you to do better work, to share their thoughts, to make their roles more redundant.You won’t be the only one with cool ideas, inspire the people around you to share their thoughts, to be brand advocates, to write about their work which will ultimately result in inbound marketing for the company.Call out the elephants in the room. If something needs serious attention don’t be the one who stays quite while everyone twiddles their thumbs in anguish. Be the one who calls it out and tries to improve the situation.You will stand out, sometimes it’s hard to determine whether it’s the right one to call out or not — but if you do a worst-case-analysis, if calling it out won’t put you in serious risk of losing your job, or even if it will, do it. It shows you’re willing to take risks on your own accord to improve the business. That’s more than any employer could ask for.Assume the position you want to be in, without asking for it. Act from a standpoint of the position you would like to have, be that position and you will acquire it. If you’re a manager but you want to implement things on the ground level and you’re completely capable to, just do it. If you’re implementing things on the ground level and you want to manage, act more like a manager and show the higher-ups that you can and should be doing that job.The tough part is the push. If you really want to ensure some sort of fluctuation, whether positive or negative — ask your superior straight to their face for what you want (after you’ve shown proven value). This may move the bar in the wrong direction if handled improperly, but it should be done with confidence and a large amount of humility regardless.The subliminal push is what I would recommend. Do so much, lead from the back, provide immense value, let that value be known, don’t boast, be humble about it but be noticed. If after a long time no one is saying anything about your effort, it might be time for a manual push. Or maybe it’s time to put in more effort. You be the judge, you have to have the psychological grasp on the situation one way or another to make the right judgement call.By the way, famous people didn’t become famous by wanting to be famous.Famous people became famous for the things they did, the things they built and the actions they carried forth.The same goes for employees, businessmen, founders, tech gurus and the like. They got to where they are by improving something, building something and providing value.It’s also worth noting that by doing better work you feel better about yourself, your perception of your own self-worth increases and so does your ability to provide value in other aspects of your life. It’s really a cyclical thing. It feels good to provide value and that feeling begets more of the same activity.A few resources you might read to get an even better grasp on the subject I’ve added in the links below, so please give those a click!Co-founder  Consultant 

During childhood, my father had setup a dairy firm so he can earn a bit more money for giving better education and life to me and my sisters. He had a day job in a bank.When needed, I had also distributed milk by going on a cycle to various customers, including some of my classmate and friends house.Born  brought up in a Ruban (Rural Urban) city in Odisha.Always heard stories from my father on how people in my small town built successful businesses with little loan from bank.After an initial attempt to get into study medical and being unsuccessful, I did an engineering in Industrial  Production.Early in career, between 1998 to 2001, I travelled some 17 countries in Europe, USA, and South East Asia. I saw the world and it further influenced my passion towards entrepreneurship.Gave up a hugely double-paid salary ($ in Finland and Rs in India) and life in Helsinki, Finland to come back to Bangalore to work for a small startup.This is during the year 1999/2000 when most IT professional in India were moving to west i.e. USA.From Bangalore, we built some amazing products for USA market from India. I tasted my creative mind and was ready to start. But I needed some money. This time I relocated myself to London  then to work with a small startup there.Started a company in 2005 while living in London, went with a solution concept paper to University of Wales, Manchester University to solve their ‘higher education /study abroad’ programs to acquire students for various studies.Tasted first failure! Me  My co-founder couldn’t agree on investment and specifically my co-founder thought it is full of risk. We closed  we are still friends.Started another company in 2006, with 2 other co-founders, one in Bangalore, other one in USA. We struggled on selecting services vs. products and more specifically which product. We also took several months to establish a bare minimum team.We called off the startup after 5 months of starting up and no substantial progress.Started another startup in 2007, this time outsourced my product development to a team based in India. I had trained the team remotely from London using Skype and webcam. The company which was developing my product decided to let go several of team members. I was about to taste 3rd failure.I approached the founder, conveyed that I intend to take over the team (or few members) if he has no issues. Started the company in 2008, while I lived in London and remotely collaborated with my team.Bootstrapped from 2008 to 2011 by having a contracting job. Within 14 months of starting up, I ran out of money in 2009 Feb. My uncle gave a personal loan so I can pay salary to my associates/employees for a month.Again ran out of money in May 2010, a childhood friend and an engg classmate offered me money so that I could pay salary to my associates/employees for a month.My wife and my first son had come to India for my son’s birth day in 2011 and their return VISA was rejected as I had no money in my bank account in UK. As per UK law, I can’t maintain a family basic need.Relocated to India in Sept 2011, pitched my childhood friend and got his first few lakhs investment.But couldn’t take salary as company needed money badly. My wife,  son lived in Odisha; whereas I lived in Pune for 2 more years.Not much appreciation in family relative circle for giving up a great life, salary  career in UK.The remoteness in starting up shaped up excellent culture and collaboration.We hired people who had an attitude and desire to do good work. We never hired anybody just because of their great educational qualification.We had 100% open information sharing : We used Skype group conversation to share info/ chat, work  discuss, celebrate success/ express sadness, pretty much every communication was an open expression on Skype.We never worked in weekends for the sake of it. We encouraged team to write beautiful software that works in nights  we sleep peacefully.We encouraged team to stay ethical and not win any customer with false promises. If we miss, we own  rectify it.We used simple online tools  easy to follow process to enable remote collaboration.We used Skype group conversation to share info/ chat, work  discuss, celebrate success/ express sadness, pretty much every communication was an open expression on Skype.Collaboration tools for project management, document management, communications helped to bridge the gap among team and also among team and customers.We even encouraged/influenced team members to access Orkut, Facebook, Twitter, almost open access to any social communities. This helped us to source feedback/learn insights and we could even connect to Customer on this channels.For instance, we could win 100s of customer (between 2008 to 2011) just via Twitter.We have an open understanding in the company: Try, if you fail, there is no penalty. Rather, if you don’t try, you will loose lot of opportunity.Don’t have to have the mindset that things will always go wrong, but let’s celebrate it when it does go wrong.We started the company to solve ‘venue sourcing’ for events. We failed  pivoted to ‘Event Ticketing  registration’.We failed several times during the product development, many customer had to suffer with changes/issues. We ensured we win them back with better products.We grew to 600% but product name (it was called Ayojak earlier) couldn’t work across globe. We pivoted to a new brand “Explara”.We are now working to lead several markets in various countries. We may fail.As I operated remotely, and we had established a culture of ‘kill the distance’ among myself  team. We extended the same to our customers.The tone across the company was ( is) that we are passionate about reaching to our customers and delivering to their issue. So let’s kill the distance between us and the customer.When there are issues (support, product, communication), its not about who is right, the customer has to be heard.How will we expect if we were the customer? Make sure that we’re down to earth and tuned to life.Keeping ethical and customer focused. If customer calls, we call them back within few minutes.If you look at any part of the world it’s customer support that matters. The more customer focused you are the better world you’re building.Thank you,SantoshCEO  Co-founder 

When App.net became a thing last summer, everyone thought it was a Twitter clone. That’s a huge marketing problem because most people in the startup community still don’t understand that App.net is offering a development platform for social products, one that comes with a clear business model that foregoes advertising, an active community of users, and exciting implications for improved UX across the app ecosystem.I think the reason for this confusion is that Mixed Media Labs made a misstep last summer when they released The value of the App.net from a developer perspective is that it’s an out-of-the-box social network, platform, and API that allows developers to quickly bring their ideas to life. I think that if App.net is going to be successful, they need to sell this vision apart from Alpha, and make it clear that App.net is where startup founders should build their next world-changing product, whether it’s built on the web, on Android, or iOS.When pitching developers, App.net needs to focus on making it clear that they are offering a development platform for applications, providing much of the foundation required to build apps like Foursquare, Instagram, and Path. The built-in community also helps to decrease the barriers for rapid user adoption.I like to think of the App.net platform as Rails for Social, providing developers with a framework that offers built-in functionality thats foundational to most social apps: user profiles, following/followers, public and private messaging, content streams, sharing for video, audio, and images, geolocation, and more to come. Beyond that, there’s also an app directory that helps new products get picked up, as well as a way for developers to get paid without having to go the advertising route.App.net could win over more monthly and yearly subscribers if they could convince developers to build more awesome products. There are clear benefits to users as more and better applications are built on top of the platform:It’s also worth noting that while App.net was founded in part to create a sustainable business not dependent on advertising, that developers are free to monetize their App.net products as they see fit, advertising included.Building this kind of platform and offering this kind of service is a huge undertaking. I’m excited that App.net taking on this challenge and interested to see whether competitors will start popping up in the coming months.Designer.

I left my job as a Product Manager at Facebook this week. After announcing that I planned to leave to start a company, thirty people set up time to talk with me one-on-one. My announcement brought out the “secret entrepreneurs,”—people who I never would have expected to be entrepreneurial. These are people with dreams. I love hearing people’s entrepreneurial dreams. You can see a glow in someone when they are describing a dream. They ask: Why are you leaving? Do you not like it here? How did you gather the courage? How do you take the risk? I had the honor of seeing people mull over the same questions I’ve been challenged with myself.I’ve spent quite a bit of time thinking about what makes someone “ready to leave a job” and do a startup. After talking through these 30 one-on-one meetings, there seem to be three big questions you should ask yourself.A few years ago, I left a job before with about one year of cash in the bank. The first 6 months were awesome; the second half of the year was not. My cash was nearing zero and I operated on fear rather than excitement. It brought me into really short-term thinking (how can I start a profitable business in the next month?!) which didn’t serve me. I ended that time finding another job.My learning is that having a significant financial cushion is important. I think one year is a good amount of time to give something a try. If you don’t currently have a year’s worth of cash as a cushion, what do you need to do? Live more frugally? Work another 6 months? Get a raise?The Big companies are great places to quickly be exposed to lots of different skills. My experience at Facebook was exactly this. I learned from the best how to be organized and how to organize a team, how to map out complicated problems into the future, and how to manage people. These were all things I was notably shitty on in my last startup. If you are a serial entrepreneur, it is also a good time to reflect on mistakes you made last time. Having both started a company and worked in a larger one, this is how I see the experiences.Sure, there is a lot of “doing” while you’re working for a larger company. But the overarching purpose for me is about learning skills and processes. Startups are where you get to choose a problem you think needs to be solved, put yourself into it, and ride 100% with the risk and reward. This is when you do your life’s work. This is when to In every situation you will always be incrementally learning. I think the important question is: have you reached 80% of the learning where you are now? I believe you know the answer to this. Are you either excited or scared of how you spend your time at your job? If so, you are still on a steep part of the learning curve.I think this is actually the real reason why people don’t leave jobs? They will say stuff about financial risk or “my co-workers are so nice,” but I think it comes down to a core insecurity about their own ability to execute. This fear is real. From my experience, the biggest risk of “going out into the unknown” is our own psychology. The world is moving around you. Friends are making $$ at their various cushy jobs, Techcrunch tells you that everyone is getting funding except you… The only way I know how to deal with this insecurity is to live with it. A fear you can’t or won’t experience will run you.The alternative to “just leaving” is to get an idea, gather a team, and get into YC or another incubator. Sounds like a good plan. But what if you don’t get into YC? You can’t depend on an external source to tell you “This is time for you to leave your job and start your company.” If you really want to do it, you have to make it happen yourself.Indecision is also a decision, but even if staying at your job is the right short-term option, you’ll feel lost until you commit to that explicitly. The only failure mode here is to not have a plan. To make that plan, you have to ask yourself:Startups are hard, in hindsight, leaving your job will be the easiest step you took.Entrepreneur.

I write a lot about love and dating. Over the past year, I’ve had more conversations with my female peers in startups and entrepreneurship about these issues than any other topic. Very few young women in startups are in healthy relationships, but that doesn’t mean we don’t strive for them or thrive in them. For some reason, we have a hard time starting and building romantic relationships. I haven’t been able to work out the exact formula for why we have so much trouble but I am certain that it has a fair amount to do with men’s fears about who we are and what we do.The seven statements bolded below are reasons that we kick ass. They were compiled with the help of a group of girls, some of whom I am close friends with and others whom I have never met in person. Together, we picked out the things that we feel make us not only unique, but also strong and powerful women. Importantly, they are also traits that help us build relationships. Hopefully, they will make you at least consider dating a Girl in Startups.__________________Whether she is building a deck or editing code, she can spend all night working because If you date a Girl in Startups you have to appreciate that Consider dating a girl in startups, but if you do, know that she won’t automatically make you #1.

Today is Day One of our new series, “30 Days of Lean Startup”. We are starting with a very simple, but important question: The word “startup” often brings to mind an image of two people working in a garage in Silicon Valley. But there’s a more useful definition laid out by Eric Ries, who coined the term Lean Startup:In other words, in With that definition in mind, there are three areas in which a startup typically faces a very high degree of uncertainty — or risk:If you’re wondering which kind of risk you face, let me help you out: It’s customer risk. Nearly always, it’s the biggest question, because you simply don’t know the value, if any, your new product has for potential customers. When I say, “Nearly always,” I mean: this is so often the case, you should assume it’s true every time.The tricky part is that commonly, product risk looks more urgent. After all, if you’ve hit on an exciting new idea that you’re pursuing, you’re doing so because you believe other people will be interested in it, too. And if you assume the demand will exist, you’ll be tempted to make sure you can build the product before you offer it to people. But that’s a Note that when you think in terms of risk, rather than company history, it becomes clear that lots of existing organizations have startups within them. For instance, if you’re Gillette and you Incidentally, the biggest company we know of that’s systematically applying Lean Startup methods is GE. Specifically: Here are some talks at this year’s conference that you might be interested in:In this talk, Johanna Wellington who runs an internal startup, GE-Fuel Cells, will share The IRS isn’t known for quick internal change; it still uses many applications from the Kennedy administration.

If you ever want to be the center of controversy in a room packed with developers, declare that one programming language is better than another. Banners will be raised and battle cries will be heard from various fiefdoms pontificating:And so on. But the fact is, as the technical cofounder of a startup company, one of the earliest questions you will need to answer will be: What is the best programming language for my startup? To answer that question at a high level you can concentrate on three aspects related to programming stacks: the Characteristics of the Language, your Local Ecosystem and the Problem Domain you are solving.Many startup customers using Amazon Web Services (AWS) tell us the reason they choose AWS is because we are Microsoft’s .NET platform is heavily used in business applications running the Microsoft Windows operating system. For Linux users, there is a port providing a subset of features via the It’s worth noting that although some free tools and libraries are available for .NET, the ecosystem is based on a licensed software model. This means that when third party tools are required, somebody somewhere will need to pay for a license and that eventually will fall upon you. Additionally, if you plan to use Windows as your OS for .NET, that will add costs (in contrast to the free license for most flavors of Linux), although Microsoft has programs that can offset or help to defer them. At the end of the day, choosing .NET is likely to cost more than choosing an open source platform.Finally, many .NET programmers come from an enterprise background; developing internal systems and some may find adapting to the pace and the lifestyle of a start-up environment challenging.Java has been around since 1995 and is a core tool for creating enterprise applications since the advent of J2EE. The long commercial life and wide adoption of Java has created a robust ecosystem of documentation, libraries and frameworks many of which are aimed at e-commerce, security, and complex transactional architectures. There are experienced Java developers readily available regionally and globally both as contractors and full-time employees. The open source community embraced Java early on, creating an abundant free marketplace of Java solutions and tools.The original goal of Java was to “write once, run everywhere”, although there is some debate whether this was ever accomplished. Additional concern over licensing rights since the acquisition of Sun by Oracle has cast some doubt for the future of the language and given rise to the phrase “Java is dead, but the JVM lives on”. This has fuelled the adoption of languages like Scala that runs on top of the JVM and can still take advantage of third party libraries. Java can also be resource-intensive, requiring more memory for example, as compared to other language. Java is used for Android devices and should be considered if that platform is part of your rollout strategy.Python is an open source interpretive language that has been embraced by many in the scientific community for its ease of learning and large set of scientific libraries. Django is a Python framework created for online newspaper publishers and powers popular start-ups such as Pinterest, Instagram, and EventBrite. Django and Python together are mostly platform independent, although developers must still design programs specifically for independence in order to run on both Windows and Linux platforms. There has been a trend in the Python community to improve code quality by dictating “one right way” to write Python, which is documented in the One caution is that Python is notoriously difficult to scale across multiple cores on a single machine. This is due to the limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). However, it is very suited to applications that scale horizontally across stateless servers, making it a good solution for applications that take advantage of the cloud. Libraries such as Boto, IPython and Fabric also make it useful as an administrative scripting tool, allowing automation and infrastructure as code. This provides increased productivity for teams that have limited hands on keyboards.Ruby and particularly the web framework, Ruby on Rails, is also a popular interpreted language for start-ups. Ruby has some comprehensive training available online, both for beginners, with no coding experience, and experts in the field. Check out One valid concern is that Ruby does not scale up well on the server side for large numbers of requests to the application. One of the early popular languages for Internet applications and websites, PHP has a vast ecosystem of developers, frameworks and libraries. Major companies including the likes of Facebook, WordPress, Twitpic, Flickr and Imgur are part of the PHP alumni. Because of the age of PHP and its long history, the quality of PHP code has a great variance. PHP doesn’t have rules like compiled languages or strict standards as seen with Python, but rather guidelines available from the developer community. As a result, larger projects that do not have a strict structure can become difficult to read and maintain, a problem known as “Spaghetti Code.”The newest entry in this list of programming frameworks is Node.js. Node.js is an event driven language and, having grown from JavaScript, the only one in this list designed from the start to serve web requests by taking advantage of JavaScript on the server side. The non-blocking I/O produces high performance server-side applications. Programmers will find that their client-side JavaScript skills are portable to server-side development tasks. Leaders such as Yahoo and LinkedIn have implemented portions of their applications on Node.js.Because Node.js is newer, people with strong skills may be harder to find and more expensive to employ. Documentation and libraries are scarce, with additional challenges around the fact that projects tend to mix Node.js with other languages and frameworks to round out the feature set. However, this situation may improve as JavaScript developers’ transition into back-end architectures.All of the languages above can be put into two categories: Statically compiled and strongly typed on the one hand or dynamic and interpretive on the other. Older, traditional enterprise languages usually fit into the former group. Code created in this manner provides developers with compile-time errors rather than run time errors, ensuring safer, well-documented code with clean interfaces. However, applications using statically compiled code will take longer to build. This trade-off made sense when these languages were initially introduced. At that time compute power was difficult to obtain and costly. Today, however, the availability of cloud computing with AWS for instantly available, pay-as-you-go compute capacity has drastically changed the industry.Now, compute power is faster and cheaper, while Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are readily available to simplify development using interpretative languages and including support for sophisticated debugging and refactoring functionality. The advantages provided by compiled languages over dynamic languages have narrowed over the last few years, with dynamic languages proven to deliver high quality code and to be naturally suited to rapid development cycles. This is why many successful startups are gravitating towards the dynamic/interpretative side of the spectrum when choosing their development languages.Outsourcing is fine for a proof of concept or when you have a specific one-off skill you do not have in-house, but to be successful you will want skilled talent from your local ecosystem. Finding good teams, ramping up projects and extending your efforts to offshore takes time, instead if you invest in the expertise you’ll need in-house it will enable you to shorten development cycles and increase the agility of your start-up. The availability of a skilled workforce will vary by geography. Some areas, for example, have many PHP developers with little or no access to Node.js people. To better understand the popularity of the languages where you are located and therefore the ultimate cost of obtaining the skills you’ll need, check out Some languages are clearly more suitable for solving different problems, which can make the decision process more straightforward. For example, if you are integrating heavily with MS Office and other Windows applications, then you should consider .NET on your list of possible choices. If you are performing functions, such as forecasting weather patterns, Python might be a better option because of its precise math libraries and ability to scale well with Hadoop. If enterprise level security for a business-to-business application is critical; you will likely want to explore using Java. In any case, your evaluation will need to take into account the problems you need to address as well as your business case and type of customers.Good question! This article covered the three main decision points that can provide assistance in your decision-making process.AWS developers often tell us they use the three points above to come up with a short list, and then make their final selection by identifying which language will allow them to iterate the quickest. They feel that this is the most important aspect because the nature of start-ups is to fail fast and fail forward. Fast iterations enable you test ideas, determine your problem space and provide you with solutions as you propel towards MVP. Do not worry too much about scaling up today. If your startup is lucky enough to have similar issues to Twitter, determining how to scale Ruby to meet exploding user demand, you are well on the road to success.Joseph K.

So you have a startup and you just signed on with a lawyer that offers deferred payment for a certain amount of legal services until you raise a round. You think this is great, and you happily sign their legal service agreement specifying how they’ll charge you. You don’t have to worry about paying the bill until you’re a funded startup so you don’t pay much attention to it.A little bit of time passes and you haven’t used your lawyers too much, but it seems they’ve already hit their free services cap. How did that happen so fast? Now you’re having mini heart attacks each time you open their bills.I recently caught up with a lawyer friend who provides a service of reviewing legal bills. He totally opened my eyes and I felt that this information was vital to be shared with the rest of the startup community.Firstly, let’s go back to that services agreement you signed. If you think about it, if your lawyer isn’t giving you a services contract that benefits them, they’re probably not very good lawyers. It likely has all sorts of clauses in there for how they can take their pound of flesh. But that doesn’t mean you can’t push back and negotiate these terms. Just make sure they don’t charge you for negotiating the contract!Here are some things you should watch out for:I hope this list was helpful to you, and if it was please share it so others can benefit from this wisdom.

I Our startup office has many windows, so we head towards the heart of the building which happens to be the stairwell. Many other people are already there, others joining every second.Some kids that came to work with their parents (summer school vacation) are here as well and it is getting a bit crowded.We hear a distant Boom. Then another one. People stop talking. The building shakes a tiny bit. Not an Earthquake shake, more like a super sonic jet flew by and rattled the windows, except there are no windows around us, only a concrete office building stairway. The sirens stop wailing. 30 seconds pass.We notice a large group of people standing outside the main entrance and curiosity grabs hold. Walking outside we see about 10 people with their smartphones taking pictures of the sky (this is Israel and everyone has a high-end smartphone, for some value of everyone and some other value of high-end).

This is a very rough sketch of what happens next (technical mumbo jumbo, feel free to skip):Since I passed the tests EC2 images are automatically generated.I’ve heard continuous deployment equated to fixing an airplane mid flight.We do this about 5 times per day and practice makes perfect. Very cool.Beka just Skyped me. He received a “Most of the Israeli army is built on a big reserve. It allows people to live their lives and only calls upon them (usually with ample warning) when they are needed. This goes on until they are about 45. Not everyone likes doing reserve duty — in fact many people try to avoid it. These are not kids anymore. They are doctors and lawyers, students, teachers and nurses, putting on a uniform, leaving their families, risking their lives for weeks every year.But now things are different. They share their thoughts in infinite streams of social media posts, Facebook Twitter and WhatsApp being the most popular. As the rockets continue they are being called upon to protect their home and they are eager and willing. And they are showered with love and respect from their families, friends and fellow Israelis.It is 7:58am, 2 minutes before the 6th (?) ceasefire is scheduled to begin, and the sirens start their horrifying wailing. You would not believe how many everyday things sound like a rocket siren. Songs on the radio. Motorcycles accelerating. Sometimes we hear distant sirens from neighboring towns, but this time the volume is too loud and there is no question that they are heading towards my house. I was just about to leave home taking my 10 year old son to tennis camp, but we drop everything, I pick up the baby and we all head toward the safe-room. Every house in Israel has one, built like a mini-bunker, usually used as a normal room. The boys cover their ears. We just manage to shut the steel window shade when we hear the boom. It is the loudest we have heard in a while, and we have heard plenty. Several house / car alarms start wailing, but other than that there is a tensed silence. 3 or 4 minutes pass and I say “It’s over”.On the radio I hear a man crying. His daughter’s room has been hit while she was luckily away. He is one of 250,000 Israelis living in the villages next to Gaza — no Iron Dome, no early warning system. His life has been living hell for the past 15 years as mortar fire rained on them non-stop disrupting their life. And it has gotten worst since He describes teenage kids shitting their pants, whole families in psychological therapy, businesses lost, families destroyed.Do I believe in a better future?I do. I said before that I’m an optimist. I would not be an entrepreneur if I wasn’t. But we need leaders who are visionaries as well.Most Israelis I know viewed I have no idea how the Palestinians in Gaza feel. They do not have free press and speaking against the Hamas can cost you your life. They might all be pacifist hippies for all I know, but the fact is that Gaza did not become Singapore [citation needed]. But it can become a paradise. It really is possible.Imagine international industrial parks with access to the Mediterranean and to Europe. Image the countries of the world really helping the Palestinians, building infrastructure, establishing free trade zones, improving education, health, employment, giving the poor people of Gaza hope. Rebuilding Gaza with a future unclouded by war.Will happy Palestinians in Gaza stop Will Israel support promote and support peace? I think so. We already have peace with our 2 most important neighbors, There are no easy solutions. Super complex problems (challenges?) stand in our way. But just like a startup tackling huge technical obstacles, you need to hold on to your vision and start executing on it, one baby step at a time.James Altucher (I’m a fan) says he never hits Publish Barry and I have bootstrapped Evature for years while we were building the first prototype, so the company is already Agile, lean and mean.

Just recently I re-watched It repeatedly got awarded with 3 out of 3 Michelin stars and is known as the best place in the world to get sushi.I first stumbled upon the documentary a few months back when I believe as Product Managers we all can learn a lot from Jiro, especially when it comes to hard nuts to crack like hiring, quality assurance and leadership …We live in a world of ‘good enough’. People talk about diminishing returns, finding the sweet spot and We easily forget that in order to create something that truly stands out and delights customers it takes vision, passion and standards that are way beyond ‘standard’.Often you will have to set your own standards since ‘industry standard’ or being ‘better than the competition’ will cause you to aim way lower than you could.I feel this is the reason why sometimes whole industries get disrupted by people who are ‘outsiders’ that naively expected way more than any of the incumbents were used to deliver.Set your own standards and live by them. Push the boundaries. Lead by example.I’m not surprised that everyone I know is drawn to the companies that produce the best products. Who cares about companies that do mediocre work? I don’t even want to imagine how hard it must be for these companies to attract talent.If you carefully watch the interactions and incredibly tight feedback loops of his team you will find that every time someone points out what could have been done better it is acknowledged and immediately executed.

If a shortcoming is discovered you will hear a short I believe it is an art to separate your own ego from the work you are doing. This is related to something I found in the On the one hand you want to be passionate about what you are doing but on the other hand you don’t want to let your ego get in the way of a better solution. You don’t win by being right all the time, you win by identifying things that are great wherever they came from.If you apply for a job at Jiro’s sushi bar you know what you are getting yourself into.

They tightly work together with their suppliers to help them succeed. Jiro’s infinite passion about creating the perfect sushi is what drives all of the observations I made.

On the anniversary of our third year in operation, I wanted to take a moment to share insights into how Science has evolved into a network of growth companies. By leveraging a proven system of marketing and distribution technologies, we scale consumer goods, services and media brands.When we started Science, our vision was simple — build big companies by pairing operational all-stars with the most passionate entrepreneurs. Three years later, we’ve substantiated our formula of leveraging our network of companies across a spectrum of direct to consumer goods and services, with online growth and marketing companies to nurture an environment of experimentation and advancement.We created an internal technology platform and repeatable systems of practices, what we collectively refer to as our Growth Platform, that have driven consumer adoption, scaling businesses that we’ve bought, invested in and built under our own roof.Our theme of disruption continues to identify older industries where we can use technology to bring innovation to subpar consumer experiences. As a result of breathing new life into older industries, a particular focus on millennials has emerged. While our reach is broad because of our ability to market and grow companies across the most ubiquitous social destinations, at this point Science possesses the strongest portfolio of platforms and technologies enabling brands to reach millennials.Science has developed a new method of producing market leading companies, by building them internally and ensuring self-sustainability early on, as well as working closely with the venture community to generate the support needed to take companies to the next level.We close 2014 with Science having acquired, founded or invested in 18 portfolio companies generating over $150M in 2014 total gross revenue. These companies range from marketplaces, commerce brands, media brands, mobile applications, and influencer networks. Nearly a third of the portfolio pushed into profitability in Q4, and the remaining ended the year well capitalized with highly supportive investors and boards.We began 2015 with our first Hackathon in India, numerous new company launches and a big push into our mobile applications and investments. Up next, we have four companies we expect to be new breakouts in our portfolio: We wanted to share a look at how we’ve structured Science to ensure fertile ground for tomorrow’s leaders. Below are some highlights, many the result of the $170M raised to date for our portfolio companies and $40M for Science.Thank you for your continued support!Michael Jones  The Science Team- Tripled the size of our growth, marketing and finance teams in our Santa Monica headquarters, ending the year with roughly 150 people on staff across San Francisco, Los Angeles, India and Armenia offices.- Science’s Growth companies now globally reach over 500M monthly users (300M users on mobile and 300M users on desktop monthly).- - - - - - - - - - - - - - CEO Science, Former CEO Myspace, Angel Investor, Entrepreneur, Former CEO Userplane, Tsavo Media

I started my first company on October 2011. It was the same year of the revolution. We got into cycle zero of Flat6Labs, it was called zero because it is the experimental cycle, we were basically lab rats.We have done all the wrong things, and met all the wrong people. We didn’t focus on building something users wanted, we wasted so much time on the wrong things and by the time we realized, it was too late and we had to shut down the company.I have seen everything you are ranting about:I don’t get it when someone complains about how dysfunctional the “Egyptian Startups Ecosystem”. I understand what they are saying and sympathize with them. However, I see it is much easier to put myself in an illusion where all the circumstances are against me, than to move and try to make progress.If you write everything you don’t like about the “ecosystem”, you will find it doesn’t hurt you that much.The reason I am saying it doesn’t affect you is because of the same reason you don’t like it. It is dysfunctional.A dysfunctional system can largely be ignored, especially that we are in the era/industry where you don’t need someone’s permission to start your own business, attract users, and make money.The trap we fall into as founders is not being pragmatic enough to benefit from the working parts of the ecosystem, and ignore the rest. It is hard to ignore the bad, because everyone talks about it, and our brains like drama.After my company failed, I decided to be pragmatic, and ignore the bad. I decided:We can debate Egypt’s ability to generate breakthrough vertical innovations. I am on the side where I see it is not possible, because of our educational system, intellectual property rights, and the funding and support systems needed to create new inventions and IPs.On the other side, I believe there is a great opportunity to bring horizontal innovations here. We are a 94 million people nation where 60% are below 40 years old. Isn’t this a great opportunity?Amazon started in 1994, Facebook started in 2004, Uber in 2009.Things take time, and require long term commitment, resilience, and hard work.The growth of the Egyptian consumer tech market is inevitable. People who will start now will harvest the results of their efforts in the next 10 years. It won’t be easy, but that’s part of the challenge.Egyptian Software Product Manager @ Booking.comA Glimpse of Vibrant Egypt Startup Scene

But what story are they telling of the Countries that Europe consists of? I analysed every article that has been published by these three in 2014 (up to 5th December) in order to find Europe’s top startup Countries as depicted by Europe’s tech media.The analysis looked at every story where specific Countries or Startups in those Countries were the main focus of the article. So, for example: A scraper was used to pull the headlines, date and URL, however Country tags were not supplied, therefore this was done manually, through checking Crunchbase, the Startups website, the original article and through Google search. This was where the real time consuming work occurred!Overall, I counted 1309 Country specific stories across TechCrunch, The Next Web and tech.eu in 2014 up until the 5th December.It should be noted that TechCrunch’s output quanitity is far superior to the other two, accounting for 1039 of these, therefore the analysis results are HEAVILY reliant on TechCrunch, almost to the extent that the above is essentially an analysis of TechCrunch’s coverage. The Next Web ran 98 Country specific stories, while tech.eu ran 172.However, if you multiply the number of The Next Web’s and tech.eu’s stories to equal TechCrunch’s output, then the top four do actually remain unchanged.Breakdown of each individual media’s coverage in 2014.To dilute the effect of stories that were written due to the writers network (e.g. about startups launching or hitting milestones), I filtered out the stories that were specific only to funding being raised, or startups being acquired, in order to see if this painted a clearer picture of what is happening in Europe’s top Startup Countries.There is an almost endless amount of caveats on an analysis like this, but here are some of the more obvious ones:Are you surprised by how much/how little coverage your Country gets by the tech media?I also write features and analysis on Nordic Startups over at • Entrepreneur and blogger • Find me on Twitter

I wrote the medium article “How we did 15 startups in 21 months” on Jan 3rd 2014. Its June 23rd 2015 now. Its almost been a 1.5 years since then. I wanted to write an update for everyone.First half of 2014, we spent trying to build a business focused chatting application called BizChat. We developed simultanoeuly for iOS and Android — and launched it in the summer of 2014. We were counting on viral methods of SMS marketing (milder versions of what PATH did), but none of that seemed to work.After all was said and done, we were experiencing a higher virality rate over email invites, than SMS invites. Part of the issue is once you get someones address book, about 70% of the numbers are wasted due to formating issues (to add +1, or 001 or 0044 etc etc). Rules are different by country and its hard to figure this out programtically. Without a growth channel, there was no point in continuing this any further.This really sucked since we invested so much time and energy into creating high fidelity apps for both iOS and Android. App development is a whole other ball game vs. web development.While doing BizChat we got good at creating Node.js real time apps and connections. We decided to give chrome extensions a shot. We tried to build out high quality Chrome extensions focused on an enterprise use case.Email Cherry allowed you to see who opened your email in real time and notify you in under 1 second. We built out a pretty impressive backend on Node.js that handled millions of concurrent connections with extremely low latency. We even got 50K or so users. But then we discovered the ugly truth behind chrome extensions — no one freaking pays. Even for a business use case. Our upgrade rates ($19.99/mon) were under 0.30%. I think Yesware has built a really nice business around this use case, but they sell through a traditional sales force. We were trying to do the opposite, get people to adopt it organically and then upgrade. Seems like unless their company is paying, most professionals just don’t want to pay out of their own pockets.In trying to figure out how to monetize our own chrome extension, we figured, lots of other extensions must have this same issue. Lets try and build out an ad network that helps monetize this space.Turns out a lot of other people, over the last decade have been down this road. There are several (mostly Israeli) companies that do over $100M in revenue in the space. Heck they even have place in Tel Aviv called ‘Download Alley’ — named after all the downloadable software (aka-ad/spyware) companies based there. Its a fascinating, highly questionable space that makes cash flow like there is no tomorrow. Ali and I were facinated.We found lots of desktop based ad networks but no one had quite figured out how to do desktop to mobile ads. Mobile to mobile ad networks are a dime a dozen, but desktop to mobile — now there was a gold mine. We built technology, filed some patents, and were off to the races. The core of this was we figured how out to do 1 to 1 attribution for a install originating on the desktop (for a mobile app).We spent the next 3 months integrating our technology with all the major attribution providers in the space. Very painful to do 10+ custom integrations, but we did it and we did it fast. Then came along, getting advertisers on board. By Nov, we had over $15M in I/Os. We also did deals with many of the large publishers in the space to get the inventory.And then we launched — first few days were great. We were on track to deliver on our I/Os by the end of the year. Finally, Ali and I were like we got this… Finally. Heres our break. Final(fking)ly! After 3 years of experimentation, we finally found some thing that can scale.And then we had oh-fuck moment. Turns out, users, even though they had expressly opt’ed in and installed our chrome extension, did not realize / forgot that the app on their phone — came from their desktop. Most users have never installed an app on their phone using the Desktop google play store. They were confused and thought the app (they had expressly clicked to install) had installed itself.They started complaining — not a lot, only 20 or so, but some how Google took notice and decided they did not like our attribution model. It was based off matching the users google play email from desktop to mobile and decided to ban us and delisted one of the apps we were promoting from the app store.Losing out on our revenue is one thing, but having one of our friends apps get de-listed. Well…. That really broke us into pieces. Words can not really describe how hard that was. Mad respect to those guys for supporting us during this and standing by our side. You know who you are — thank you. We will never forget.We decided to exit the chrome extension space all together. Did we leave too soon, perhaps? Could we have made an alternate model work. Maybe. But dealing with google’s (or rather lack of) compliance team, just left a bad bad taste with us. We were 100% legit, trying to do the right thing, and yet no one (including people we know), at google would give us the time of the day. Ah well. Fuck this. Move on….Shutting it down, was a very hard, painful, public defeat.Sometime last year, we got this cutie. Benji. Rubbing his belly somehow makes every thing better :)After the ad-network, Ali and I were spent. We had hired a great team, (Aaron, Marilyn, Jared). Salman had been through hell and back with the technology and integrations with 30+ companies. We were all burnt out. We let the team go and decided to take 3 months off. No work. No stupid startups. No ideas. Just focus on ourselves. I pledged to surf daily. Ali wanted to bike. Trying to bring balance back in life.So all of that lasted 3 weeks. We came across Fanduel.com and thought, we should do this for eSports. We know eSports -we ran the #2 League of Legends team in North America. We got this. We promised ourselves 3 months off. But I guess we really can’t help ourselves.Problem was the League of Legends season was starting in 4 weeks. This business is very season dependent — if we had to launch, we had to do it in 4 weeks. So Ali cancelled his Hawaii trip, I ended up working on mine (surf+weather was shit anyways). In 2 weeks, Salman and I built the site. We launched on Jan 12th this year.This is me in Hawaii while we launched. Total FML mode.And then magic happened. Given our connections in the space, we were able to scale very quickly. So did the top line. Magic was all around. Finally product market fit. Finally…This was our last shot. We were running on fumes (few months of cash left). We decided to increase our marketing spend for us which brought us down to 2 months of cash. If this had not worked, we would have folded the company.And then the VCs came calling. We literally had our pick of the valley. Initially we decided, oh lets not raise too much. $3–5m would be fine. After 2 weeks of meetings, we ended up raising $12.2M from Seqouia. We met them for the first time on a Thursday, and signed on Tuesday the next week. They literally moved faster and were more decisive than any other VC i’ve seen. The term sheet was signed at 10:30pm at our office. We included a host of other folks in the round that we really liked (And if you’re thinking, yes, this is still the same company, same investors as Higear. We brought everyone onboard. No investor has ever lost money with us, and we’re very proud of that. Short term it means more dilution for us, but reputation is everything, and people tend to always remember such things. Always make investors whole (or better) no matter what.I’ve been around long enough to know it wasn’t really us. These things are based on hype cycles and we’re definately in a hype cycle right now. Right after we raised our $12M, our #2 competitior raised $4.2M off our tail wind. I don’t think our business deserved the valuation we got, and neither did theirs. Fanduel and Draftkings each have raised over $300M at this point. We just got lucky getting their tail wind + eSports is blowing up and everyone wants in.There are some serious issues with the model.Jury is out on how the DFS space will play out. We’re doing whatever we can on our part, not to get into the low margin high volume business. But lets see how it all plays out.So heres the scorecard for the last 1.5 years since I wrote the first article. Failed at another 3 startups — and finally got 1 to work. So total of 4 in 15 months.Vulcun is off to a great start. We’re at 30 employees now (up from 3, few months ago) — $12M in the bank and a booming top line. To the outside world it certainly must seem like overnight success. All in all, 19 startup attempts in the last 4 years. Probably more to come.Builder of things and ideas.

It’s common knowledge that startups move incredibly fast. In such an environment, asking for permission is not even an option.The best employees will just figure out what needs to be done and go ahead and do it. If you were hired in an early stage team you’re supposed to be smart and be able to figure out by yourself what has the highest priority or if someone else on your team needs help with something.You will not be able to effectively impact your company if you just sit down and pound through your to-do list without knowing what the rest of team is up-to.This might be the leadership team’s responsibility, but you still should try to get insights into what other departments are working on and how your work will help or block anybody else in the company.Obviously, as you’re expected to know what everyone else is working on, you’re also supposed to clearly let others know what you’re up to.Some people tend to only communicate updates on tasks and projects which they think will impact others, but it’s much more effective to give a (daily || bi-weekly || weekly) update about everything you’re doing.Never be afraid to ask for help. If you’re stuck on something and you know someone else can help it is You’ll undoubtedly have to do so oftentimes, so when you can, ask for help. You’ll get stuff done faster, learn faster, foster collaboration and build morale all at the same time.People sometimes hesitate to ask for help, worried what others might think. In reality, team members are happy to help and appreciate it when others ask for it.Startups are not an environment where you can under-promise and over-deliver.Whether you’re talking with customers, partners or your team, you should always over-promise and then work your ass off to over-deliver on those promises. Startups move fast and you often have to sell more than you really have. That leaves you with no choice other than doing whatever it takes to actually deliver.In my opinion, the #1 skill for a startup employee is the ability to prioritizeYou will always have a ton of stuff on your plate, probably more than you have time for, so it’s really essential that you’re able to effectively decide what needs to be done first and what can wait justCurate the details when needed or just get the 80% done when it makes sense.No matter your role, there are three things you should constantly be doing for your startup:If you’re in a high growth company, one of the biggest challenges it will face is definitely recruiting smart people.When you go to meetups, pubs, weekend BBQs, anywhere, always try to recruit. Tell your friends what positions your company is looking for and ask them if they know someone. If they don’t, incentivize them to ask their network anyways. Expanding your recruiting reach by even one degree will help immensely with your company’s recruiting efforts, which is one of the best things you can do.Even if you are an engineer, you should still be selling your company’s product all the time. Consumer product? Have your friends go to your website or download the app. Enterprise or B2B? Always mention what you and your company do when you meet new people, you’ll eventually meet someone who’ll become a customer.Bringing in customers for your company is one of the biggest joys, especially if you’re not in sales.This one goes without saying: as an early startup employee you’re expected to be proud of where you work and do all you can to make it succeed.Always talk about and market your company’s product. Post news on your social networks, wear your company’s swag, put a sticker on your laptop and give out stickers to your friends.Remember to have fun. You won’t be able to do all of the above if you’re unhappy or overly stressed and not looking forward to every work day.It’s a hell of a ride, it’s fun, it’s rewarding and it’s much easier than being a founder, so enjoy it and try to learn as much as possible.Co-founder 

Think about working at a startup.If you’re like me, you imagine a modern, interesting office space—probably in a hip San Francisco neighborhood—complete with nerf wars and a healthy supply of craft beer. Sure, the base salary may be lower than this fictitious company’s larger competitors, but the casual working environment, potential for wealth (through equity), and “fun” environment make it all worth it. Right?My company used to fit most of this stereotype… when it was founded, thirteen years ago. In fact, many of these features stuck around until about three years ago, when our success started transforming us into a larger, more “serious” organization.I had recently been promoted to a managerial role, and tasked with growing our services and methodologies to meet industry need, while still recruiting top engineering talent. Much like software, security engineers worth hiring know how much they’re worth—and they want the best perks they can get.We used to play Mario Kart for fifteen minutes about five times per day; we used to play volleyball on the beach for a whole afternoon once a week; we’d take long, luxurious lunches and no one cared when we we got into the office or when we left—our best work happened in the middle of the night, anyway. As a small organization, this work style fit us great. Except for one small detail.We weren’t happy.We loved the perks, but for a reason that was a mystery to us for an embarrassingly long time, there was a ubiquitous feeling of dissatisfaction. I’ll spare you the tedious process of realizing that our work was not fulfilling. The short version is that even though we had the culture we wanted, our business was not succeeding at the rate we had hoped and it was becoming difficult to resist the pull of higher compensation at a larger organization.Our solution was to buckle down and evolve into the successful business that we knew could become. Unfortunately, when you are pushing as hard as you can to be a success—making changes like changing our client base from small local banks to Fortune 100 behemoths—you can’t disappear for an afternoon to play volleyball any time the weather happens to be nice. You can’t tell an organization that’s paying you huge sums of money that their deliverable was delayed because we needed “just one more lap” in Mario Kart, or that we can’t make their 10:00am Eastern meeting time because most of the engineers aren’t in until 10 In making these adjustments, we probably went too far in the other direction. Attrition rates in engineering increased sharply, and it became obvious that we were taking the company culture too far from its roots—and from the type of organization we wanted to be part of. Little by little, we reintegrated our old “startup vibes,” each time carefully weighing the potential impact to both business and morale.The big stuff came first, and was easiest to implement: scheduled afternoons of beach volleyball, generally very early in the month (when we weren’t on “crunch time”); flexible working hours for engineers, as long as they were on call in case a client needed us urgently; all expenses paid trips to industry conferences.The difference is that we stopped thinking about the office as a playground, and started seeing it as a comfortable and relaxed place to work and conduct business. So many people forget that while, yes, you want to enjoy your job, that’s not I’m happy to say that since making these adjustments, a lot has changed for the better. My engineering team grew from three engineers at its smallest to about twenty. We’ve significantly lowered our attrition rate, and engineers seem to be much happier and more fulfilled—I know I am. We’ve also been named one of Outside Magazine’s “Best Places to Work” for the last several years in a row, which really underscores the success we’ve had scaling our culture.So, while there are no more Mario Kart tournaments at the office (and I The next time you’re lamenting your company’s lack of twice-weekly catered lunches, think about the culture, not the perks, that surrounds you.

I talked last time about what not to do when you have a startup idea. If you haven’t read that post, I recommend you Do you? I’m not going to lie, I think pretty much all of my ideas are great too. I need other people to come along and tell me I’m full of it and so do you. These first steps are all going to revolve around getting out and talking to people to figure out if your idea is solid. If it isn’t, you could end up wasting a huge amount of time.You’re not going to get particularly excited about this advice. The first thing anyone wants to do when they have a business idea is start hustling/coding, but those arent the best uses of your time. Tons of people waste money and time on something that no one wants, and can ruin their lives in the process.Watching this video is painful, but I recommend it to truly understand what I’m talking about:This is what happens when you don’t validate your idea first.Going out and talking about your idea with people is tough. No one likes being told their baby is ugly, but it’s better to find it out now than a year down the line. Validating means you can quickly go through a few ideas to find the best one, and then start building without worrying about the market existing when you’re doing.You most likely thought of an idea and not a problem. That’s fine, but now that you have that idea you need to figure out what problem it’s solving. If you think about it and realize that it’s not really solving a problem, then it’s probably not going to work out.Think about hover cars. Very cool idea, but they aren’t really solving a problem. We would still need some sort of road system, and unless they were flying they wouldn’t reduce traffic.Now, there are of course very successful startups that aren’t really solving a problem. Pinterest is my favorite example of this—it’s a pure consumption site that no one To validate that there’s a real problem, all you need to do is talk to people. Find people in your demographic, and ask them if theyve ever felt like this is a problem. If they respond “eh, kinda” then you might want to keep looking. But if they respond “YES, ugh, every day” then you’re probably on to something.Now you need to prove that the way you’re addressing the problem is the best way. This will likely change as you develop the product—you might find that certain features are unnecessary and others that you never thought of are crucial. But you need to make sure that the general idea is a good solution first.Think about it like this: youve identified that monitoring how long to steep tea for is a problem among tea drinkers. They hate their tea getting bitter, but also want it to be full-bodied. Your solutions could be:Maybe you thought of number 2 first, but people don’t like the idea of having to use their phone for it that much. Instead of scrapping the whole thing, try other solutions to the same problem and see if they get more interest. Tea drinkers might kill for a mug that automatically removes the tea bag when it’s ready (I know I would).You’ll know you have a winning solution when people will:It’s really easy to get a false positive in your interviews. If you’re not careful, people will straight up lie to you because they think that’s what you want to hear. There are ways you can prevent this though:Once you have proved that there is some weight to the problem and solution, now you can start building.But the policy of validating things as quickly as possible still holds. Don’t lock yourself away for a year while you hack together the perfect solution—you’ll hit the same problem as if you never validated your idea in the first place.Instead, you need to get to the next stage of feedback as soon as possible. This means building the most ghetto, basic version of the solution that you pitched to people before. In Lean Startup terms this is the “Minimum Viable Product” or MVP, and different people have different definitions but the one I like best is:This doesnt mean create something ugly and hacked together, but don’t kill yourself on getting to a perfect state either. This quote has been overused but just in case you haven’t seen it, it’s a good one to remember:So get to that state where you can give it to people and see how they use it as quickly as possible. If you ever find yourself thinking “well, I could give this to people, but I’d rather wait until we’d done A, B, and C…” then just give it to them now. They might tell you that you don’t need B and save you a lot of time.Thought you were done with interviews after the initial validation stage? Nope, it never ends. Every iteration on the MVP merits another round of interviews and user feedback, so keep building a list of people willing to try out the product and finding places where you can go bother new ones.You can even do this before your product is in a state to leave people with it. Take the early version that requires your help out and show it to people, see what they like, dislike, and would want to see added. You might discover things you never thought of and that can help you get to an MVP state much sooner.Make sure before you build in some additional feature that it’s something people really want in your product. A lot of great products are that way because of their simplicity and clarity. You don’t want to turn into a Microsoft Office product with a plethora of features that never get used.If you get to this point, you’re building something that people are enjoying and on your way to a great product. You’ll need to bring some other crazy people in to help, and maybe some money, but all of that is secondary to having this solid foundation for getting started. You’ll be head and shoulders above most people trying to startup these days.Marketing Sumo for SumoMe (we are dedicated to making it easy to share product ideas with the world.

Yesterday, Google bought Nest for $3.2B.Today, I spoke to a half dozen entrepreneurs that saw that as a sign that their companies had real potential to exit large (maybe not Nest large, but large nonetheless.)Those entrepreneurs are idiots. As are most of us.There is only a single indication of a potentially large exit — explosive growth.If your company’s growth is explosive, as defined as uncontrollable, server melting, holy shit I don’t know what we should do, hold on to your seats, because this is just insane growth, then maybe, just maybe, you will see a large exit (or maybe large funding round).But the likelihood your company is growing at that rate is nearly zero.So what are your choices?Quit. Yup. Just stop what you are doing right this minute. Think it through, pull out Excel and forecast the actual time (without the standard entrepreneurial optimistic factor) it will take you to get to $100mm in annual revenue. Longer than five years? You are not exploding. Quit.Or adjust your expectations. Stop burning money. Treat your current financing as the only money you will ever get. If your company doesn’t have a clear path to an inflection point or terminal velocity that will take it to $100mm, you will never get to the KABOOM exit.But what about your investors that said don’t worry about revenue? Cool. Take a moment to really explore the viability of this reality. You are not showing signs of explosive growth. Things are going to be potentially hard. Will they be there with a checkbook? If you are unsure, even in the slightest, assume they won’t, and build accordingly.(As an aside, you can be showing explosive growth in user numbers or any metric/KPI that is indicative of the ability to eventually push $100mm in annualized revenue. Take Twitter as an example. They didn’t care about revenue until they did. And then BOOM! they jumped in Uncle Scrooge’s money vault.)The greatest trait of an entrepreneur is also our biggest Achilles heel. Our hope and optimism. Yet, we suspend realism and pragmatism for that very same hope and optimism. You are not Nest or Twitter or Facebook or Snapchat or Uber or any other explosive growth company. Don’t be unrealistic with your actual potential and optimize for the success that your company is supposed to achieve.Remember it is ok to not exit Nest large, but it’s not ok to drive yourself into the ground trying to achieve something that will never happen.Supporting founders 

I guess this isn’t as much “how-to-guide” as it is a “how-I-did-it-guide”. I think In the spring of 2007 I graduated college with a great degree, no real plan of what I wanted to do with my life, and approximately $85,000 in student loan debt.Fast forward nearly 4 years later; I had found my way into a job working in sales and consulting at a global software company that was a leader in it’s space. At this point I had been with the company for nearly 3 years, I was making in the range of $100k a year, and was constantly one of the top performers. Problem is, I wasn’t happy.The company I worked for had about 700 employees at the time. I was a top performer, but still a mid sized fish in a big pond. I no longer wanted to be a little gear in a big machine. I didn’t even want to be a big gear in that machine. Instead, I wanted to build my own machine. At that time I had virtually no prior experience, couldn’t code, knew nothing of the startup ecosystem, and didn’t know a VC from a hole in my head. I wanted to build something of my own, and with no income, About 12 months before launching my company, I met Because I was unhappy (read: miserable) with my job, I self sabotaged. I used to show up late to work, take long lunch breaks, and dress as if everyday were casual Friday. Generally, I showed a lack of respect for the office culture and my superiors. Even though I wasn’t taking things seriously, I was still a top performer so the powers at be let most of it slide, until I had a rather public disagreement with a high ranking Director. Despite being a top performing consultant in May, because of this outburst I was told that if I didn’t hit my number in June I would be let go. So what did I do? I didn’t hit my numbers… why? Unemployment. That’s why. Unemployment + the savings I had would give me the runway to give this whole startup thing a try. Thank God for unemployment.If you’re in my situation, unless you’ve got that Mitt Romney style hookup and can go to Mommy and Daddy for cash, a revenue-less product is not what you should build.

Good luck preselling advertising space to companies based on the future traffic your social networking app is going to have.My cofounder is the stuff dreams are made of. He’s more machine than man. His picture belongs next to the word “Focus” in Wikipedia. In fall 2011 he entered us into every business plan competition we could find. We attended pitch competitions all over the country (thank you unemployment). We were shit on by most judges and told we’d never succeed. But all it took was one competition to change everything. Approximately 6 or 7 months after “leaving” our jobs we won a national business plan competition sponsored by MillerCoors and were awarded a $25,000 grant. Oh yea, and one of the judges liked us so much that he invested $50,000 in our business. Now we’re cooking.When you’re living on a a little more than a 1/10th of what you’re accustomed to making life can get hard. It can get real hard. It can’t be all work and no play, so you need a some work life balance or you’ll lose your mind. My cofounder and I had to find interesting ways to entertain ourselves. We started attending every networking event we could. Not just because it’s good to make new friends/connections, but also because networking events almost always offer free booze and appetizers. Boom. No spending money on dinner tonight. Craigslist is always a source of interesting entertainment (get your mind out of the gutter). We once found an opening to attend the filming of Minuto Para Ganar (Fox’s spanish version of Minute To Win It). We didn’t speak spanish but that didn’t matter because it was something interesting to do and they even paid us $100 bucks for sitting in the audience. Double bonus.We’ve been at this for a little over 2 years now. We’re now a team of 6 full time and we’re cash flow positive.

We’ve been nominated for Startup of The Year by the Wall Street Journal and gotten more press than I can count, including making the cover of Crain’s Magazine.

I’m still not making a fraction of what I used to make but the fact of the matter is I’m happier than I’ve ever been. We’ve busted our asses over the last 2 years and I can tell you that we’re proof that hard work pays off. Most people told us we would fail, but we’re still here.

Flickr is the first big company I can remember with funky spelling. But they were just the tip of the iceberg. Countless startups have joined them in this trend. There are a few variations of the funky spelling startup name:This is where it all started. We all know of Flickr. The unorthodox spelling catches our attention and makes it easy to remember. There have been plenty others to follow the trend. Most notably:Don’t want to drop a vowel? No problem. How about add an extra letter somewhere?You can even add a random letter to the front of your name too: eBay, iCloud, oDesk, etc.And by “Super Cool”, I mean “Super no-one-will remember it”. I know you think youre super clever, but most people wont remember your .it, .us, or .ly extension. A few notable exceptions to the rule:If none of the above techniques work for you, just spell it completely different than anyone would expect:The problem with all of this is that it’s screwing up how I spell things.

Everyone has things that they love doing as part of their work. Whether it’s talking to people, selling over the phone, composing spreadsheets or creating beautiful presentations everyone has their thing.Conversely everyone has things that they loath which form part of their work. One of the most interesting things that I hear people say when they find out that I am an entrepreneur is that I must get to do all of the things that I love to do. That’s kind of true but not the whole picture. In fact it’s probably the first frame of the trailer that is the movie of what might one day be my life.The truth is this:We do it this way in the hope that one day the business we build will grow to allow us to do the things we hate for increasingly smaller periods of time and the things we love for longer and longer periods of time.For me, one of the things I hate is deep etching product shots. I absolutely hate the soul-destroying and repetitive nature of this work. I hate it almost as much as I hate washing the dishes after a meal (which must be the worst possible activity in a day).The interesting by-product of startups forcing entrepreneurs to do the things they potentially hate is that the entrepreneur learns a host of very interesting and diverse skills whether they want them or not.For me? You guessed it. I can deep etch product shots. I don’t Doing things that you aren’t fond of can help in a variety of ways.When I talk to people who are employed and receive a stable salary every month I’m always stunned at the level of complaining that takes place. They hate their boss, they hate their commute, they hate answer the phone, they hate talking to customers, they hate the product, they hate meetings, coffee, tea, milk, the toilets and basically anything else that they encounter is fair game to hate. But in truth, none of those are material. They are just things that in passing they dislike a little.At the opposite end of the scale, I very rarely hear employed people gush about how much they love what they do, or even sometimes just like what they do. Sure, there are ups and downs all over the show, but on the whole most entrepreneurs I know are grateful for the experiences they have on a daily basis. Entrepreneurs do not mindlessly pass through days hoping that the next will go faster than the last. Entrepreneurs relish every second they have to work on their baby.There probably isn’t a more appropriate analogy for building a business than raising a child. I’ve personally never raised a child but I know some people who have and from what I can see, they two things are pretty damn close.For the first few years parents do all sorts of things that they hate: Clean up vomit and shit like it’s no big deal, lose a lot of sleep, suffer from intense highs and lows, very rarely know exactly what the baby needs or wants and when things go wrong it can take a long time and a lot of pain to recover.Now lets analyse an entrepreneurs first few years in business: Clean up a lot of shit like it’s no big deal, lose a lot of sleep, suffer from intense highs and lows, very rarely know exactly what the business needs or wants and when things go wrong it can take a long time and a lot of pain to recover.You get my point .Building businesses is filled with a lot of shit and wading through it can often be overwhelming and feel never ending. But then just as you think you’re about to break your baby says its first words or takes its first step and all the pain you felt two years before disappears.More often than not it’s impossible to do one without the other. That’s what it feels like to run a startup.Founder of What founders go through building businesses

“How can this company return 100x on my investment?”Answer that question and you will have an unlimited amount of investors for all time, because investors are playing for Golden Tickets (almost universally).Let me run you through some examples.[ Click to Tweet (can edit before sending): MY BLOGGING COMPANYWeblogs, Inc., my second company, created Engadget, Autoblog, and 80 other blogs when we sold it to AOL for $30m — 18 months after we started it.When Mark Cuban invested $300,000 for 15% of the business we had a $2,000,000 valuation. Now, Mark never asked how this business would make him 100x on his money, but in my mind I had a very specific answer for how this business *could* grow fast.Now, we had  $100,000 in total revenue when we sold, but he still did ~15x his money in just over a year — not too shabby!MY HUMAN-POWERED SEARCH ENGINEI had a crazy idea back in the day that humans could build search results just like the Wikipedia built an encyclopedia (Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia had a similar idea around the same time).At the time I was hot, the Wikipedia was hot, and I pitched this idea to the best investors in the world. At the time it was clear that search was $100b market so my idea was, “If we get 1% of that market it’s a billion dollar company!” In truth, today, you would be worth a LOT more than that.Investing in Mahalo at $10m or $100m made a lot of sense and we got a lot of amazing investors. We did get to 15m uniques and $10m run rate on AdSense — but we missed the window to sell before the big Google SEO correction (called Panda). Hard lessons learned, but we’re still alive: I’ve built How do you model this for your startup in plain English, and that’s credible? Follow these steps. Important to note, not every angel or investor is looking for 100x. Some are looking for 50x or 25x, or to learn and have fun. Know your investor, ask them, “What type of returns are you optimizing for?”For me, I look at every deal and say, “Does this have a chance to go 100x?” If it doesn’t then I’m out. Not because I need to make 100x on every deal, but because hitting 100x on ONE DEAL pays for lot of startups flaming out! Also, why would I invest in something that has a best case of a 10x return when I could invest in something with a best case of a 50, 100, or 1,000x return? You swing for the fences in this angel game I’ve learned.First, it helps if you start with a reasonable valuation. If you are trying to answer the 100x on your money question and you’re starting at $2m it’s a lot easier than $10m. I know this, because I turned down a number of startups in the past year because I said, “You know, I can see this business growing to a $250m business, but that would require $5–10m in profits (25–50x on earnings). In order to make 100x on it the business would need to be valued at $2.5m right now.”Later stage investors are “cash on cash” investors. They look at putting $100m into Twitter in a late stage and “only getting 10x” as a huge $900m victory — as they should. We are talking about early stage investors in this piece. For later stage, drop a zero from 100x!Second, have a plan for how much your customers will pay proved out. You only need to have one person tell you, “I would pay $25,000 per month for this product” to get the conversation going. One startup I invested in recently came to me having landed a handful of six figure deals per year just six months after I invested. I immediately developed a plan with them of how we will now sell that performance — six figures per month in recurring revenue — to our next round of investors so *they* can see a 50x+ return on investment.This is obvious stuff, but being able to identify how many people need your product, and what it will cost to get them on board, really helps. If you’re doing a news application (like I am with Inside.com) it’s a hard, hard task. “Ummm…everyone in the world with a smartphone or web browser is a potential customer, and you can acquire App installs for $1–5 after you lose customers who have downloaded your App and no longer remember or care about you.” This is easy in enterprise or products, which is why so many founders rushed in to enterprise over the past couple of years.Explaining to an investor that you’re going to make $1m in San Francisco for your food delivery service (think Sprig, Postmates), before moving out to 19 more cities in the USA and 20 cities internationally, is super credible: same product, same playbook, new market.However, saying you are going to go from a search engine to a mobile operating system and self-driving cars, like Google has done, is NOT credible. Wall Street has had/is having a hard time believing that Google can execute exceptional products in a large number of verticals — and that’s Google! Google … with unlimited cash, brain power, and a 1B+ user base!I like to do this in a sentence and NOT with a huge spreadsheet. Great founders can walk up to the white board and do the simple math and explain their strategy.Now, it’s not reasonable to point to other folks who exited and say, “We’ll get some percentage of what WhatsApp got from Facebook” — but that doesn’t stop founders from using that moment in time as a proof point.Optimizing around the possible return of your investors shows you understand their key issue: getting a return so that they can keep angel investing (or are able to raise another fund).Feedback welcome in the comments!best @I angel invest in awesome startups... and try to build them myself.

Each spring, I visit art schools in the northeast and give presentations about When Link is lost or needs some direction, he seeks out townspeople or merchants who provide valuable information and help him make sense of the world. Sometimes, they even point him toward someone or something else to support his mission. Link talks with the Old Man in the cave who tells him to visit a merchant under a waterfall. Then he treks all the way across Hyrule to get the next piece of helpful (and sometimes crucial) information. In the early days, I talked with people who knew more about Link is only as strong as as the tools he has to work with. Early on, he is given the Wooden Sword and that transforms him from a boy into a warrior. Throughout his adventure, Link acquires tools and skills such as the Bow, Stepladder, Raft, Magical Key,Silver Arrow, and Book of Magic — they enable him to navigate more freely, see in the dark, kill bigger enemies, take more damage, etc. These items are a company’s employees. It was impossible for me to have every skill needed to start a company and produce projects, so the first thing I did was expand my “tools” by finding a tech co-founder, hiring an animation director, and working with people who had different and more specialized skills than I did. Even a few years in we’re still expanding our arsenal — just last week we hired a HR Specialist. By upgrading the team with new expertise, it enables CloudKid to be more efficient, adaptable and intelligent. Most importantly, we can fight bigger enemies.Link travels around Hyrule battling enemies, solving puzzles, exploring dungeons, and defeating guardian monsters, but his mission revolves around one thing — saving Princess Zelda. In order to do that, he must complete the Triforce of Wisdom by collecting all eight pieces to be powerful enough to defeat Ganon. Princess Zelda is a company’s vision and each dungeon/guardian monster that you defeat (and piece of Triforce earned) is a launched product, a new feature, or a completed client project. Early on, projects such as Throughout his adventure, Link needs items such as arrows, bombs, potions, and food for survival, but he also needs Rupees to purchase them. While Rupees are abundant throughout Hyrule, it takes hard work to earn them — Link must put his own butt on the line and slay lots of baddies! If Link has ample Rupees, he can stock up on items that will come in handy during long dungeon missions, but if he doesn’t, his inventory will be depleted and survival will not be easy. While it is possible to prevail without money, having it undoubtedly provides an advantage. By having cash to invest in everything from product features to employees to computers/software to office space to insurance, companies are able to attain their goals more efficiently. We are fortunate to have loyal clients who have enabled us to build a studio and awesome team, but it comes at a cost. At our size we need a constant flow of projects (and cash) to keep the lights on and people employed. Sometimes this endeavor becomes all-consuming. One must be careful because the pursuit of cash can take your eye off the mission, but without it, the road will always be more difficult.Hyrule is a dangerous place, so it’s only natural that Link runs into nasty critters who slow him down. These obstacles are everywhere and Link must face them head on in order to survive, but it’s also inevitable that he goes unscathed. From simple nuances such as the Link’s adventure begins when he decides to rescue Princess Zelda. Humble but brave, he puts himself in harm’s way to save Hyrule and make his world a better place — he’s the ultimate “good guy” and hero. Businesses and entrepreneurs also need heart and humility. With an endless and dizzying stream of new gadgets, games, apps, sites, features, and videos launched daily, it’s more important than ever to provide something meaningful beyond your latest product and contribute to the greater good. This might include fostering a supportive work environment for employees, regularly contributing to open source projects, taking part in local community service, or building technology that reverses climate change.

Christmas messages, despite all the best intentions, have never been distinguished by their depth. And with each year, as our connections grow and our attention withers, the temptation increases to quickly dash off notes that are ever more about us, ever less about the amazing people we want to reconnect with, check in on, and thank.Such was my shabby excuse for avoiding end of year messages, resorting instead to an inadequate sprinkling of hellos and thank yous across the seasons.Until, that is, a surprising Christmas Eve experiment last year.In an end-of-year catchup with Alex Lovell-Troy, my friend and technical co-founder, I shared my frustration about so unreliably saying thank you for generous acts that matter so much.Over the year, the kind introductions made for me — better than any gift — had solved my biggest problems, sparked the best ideas and created numerous rich professional and social relationships.Of course, I follow up initially on an introduction with whoever made it. But by the time the connection has blossomed, often months or years later, I usually forget to mention what happened to the very person who made it possible.I like to think I pay it forward. But I realised, then, I definitely did not share it back.Exploring how important introductions had been for me, I also wondered if any of the introductions I’d made had been similarly helpful. And, if not, how I could do better.Both fascinated by the challenge of how to create more meaningful, impactful connections, we devised an experiment to look more deeply into what happens because of our introductions.We put together two simple Google docs. A spreadsheet showing who had introduced me to whom — and what had happened. And a form, asking if introductions I had made had been helpful, and how I could do better.Next, setting aside the afternoon of Christmas Eve — we had become pretty intrigued — I dived into three email accounts. Searching about 7,000 emails for “Intro”, “Introduction”, “” etc, I plotted the outcomes of connections in the spreadsheet.Threads began to emerge. Many wonderful.A to B, who had introduced me to Archbishop Tutu, who had been delighted by and very supportive of the work of prisoners in South Africa I am writing about.C to D, who had invited me to spend an unforgettable day with the Dalai Lama, discussing secular ethics.E to F, who had put me in touch with the Other introductions had led to investment, collaborations and much invaluable advice. Sometimes the intros themselves, outcomes aside, were just cool. One friend had introduced me to Biz Stone. Though Biz never replied, I was so touched by the introduction, I included this in the intro map.After three hours, I had logged about 60 of the most important or interesting intros made for me over the last couple of years, focusing on those for which I could share great stories. There were many more good intros which were harder to measure. These I left out, along with those made by extremely private people, as I was using real names.It was exhausting. But I felt pretty lucky, and profoundly grateful.Everything I had been able to achieve in recent years had been built on others’ openness generosity with their connections.Then came the second surprising treat.I composed an email, including a link to the magical Google spreadsheet, to about 150 people. Each person I had either received a great intro from, or made an intro for. I explained that I simply wanted to thank them for what they’d done for me, and find out how I could do more for them through intros or otherwise.I sent this email, with the subject “How you’ve helped me”, mid afternoon on Christmas Eve. I expected to hear little, if anything, until the New Year.By dinnertime, I had more than 30 replies. By Boxing Day more than 70. Over the next few weeks nearly everyone I’d shared it with wrote back.Had I announced I had won the lottery and was splitting it amongst my friends, I don’t think I would have more received more — or more enthusiastic — replies.Everyone loved reading the map of consequences. Many friends said, had they known how their intros helped and flourished, they would have made more intros for me, and — most intriguingly — more intros for Many of those I’d introduced also shared wonderful stories about what had come of my intros. (And, indeed, I found myself wanting to make more helpful intros for them.) They also said they enjoyed telling me; they’d just needed a prompt.A couple of people even said they were going to start logging details on intros they’d made and received in a similar Google doc.So Alex and I built I asked a brilliant friend Since we built our alpha, we’ve learned a great deal from our fantastic super-connector users. But introductions are delicate creatures. We’ve got a lot more to learn.We think it’s a great problem to solve.Connectors hold the keys, through their introductions, to incredible value, locked up in networks. They are like the computers whirring away at cracking codes to release bitcoins into the world.The difference with intros is the value unlocked helps not only the connector, but so many others too — and often those working on the most important problems.If you doubt why this matters, I can’t recommend highly enough Entrepreneur  author.

A good public relations (PR) agency is worth their weight in gold. If your startup has one of those on payroll, they It is not just press releases and pitch calls, anymore (sorry, in-house college educated PR specialist who counts on their one press hit per quarter to keep their salaries and health benefits). Public relations is about context, these days. It’s a continual conversation, not a press mention.Over the last two months, we went from this (screencap at left) to completely halting our execution. It was against the policy of our PR firm to double their efforts. We had to end what had been working so well for us. Instead, we paid a tremendous amount of money per month to cede efforts to a PR agency. PR hits fell from 1-2 mentions per week, in year one, to For startups like ours, PR isn’t about notoriety or ego. It is sheer mathematics:Our sorrows aside, there were some amazing lessons to be learned.The most important?

Easily a “shit no one ever says” statement as I have never met a single startup founder who But it still happens and my heart bleeds that we still have to watch significant companies in our technology space get caught up in Now, there are a few things that are absolutely true in this recent case of So what can we all learn from this incident that can help all of us grow a bit more wiser when it comes to creating a professional environment that is productive, encouraging, and diverse as we all want it to be?Perhaps I should first start by sharing why I really care about this and to answer that question I will simply post a few pictures of the loves of my life:I have two beautiful girls who mean the world to me and like every parent I hope and pray that they grow up in a world that is A future that is bright and full of promise and opportunity; one that affords an open door at every turn based on merit, skill, interest and passion instead of the color of their skin, their sexual preference, their cultural and socioeconomic history, or the fact that they are women at all.I am an idealist (as most entrepreneurs are) and I hope that I can be a part of a generation, And that’s where it loops back and that’s where I think I can honestly land with all of this noisy mess that’s happening around us in the tech world: Regardless of how it all really went down the beginning (and ending) find their start with the very leaders who first began the venture in the first place. They are the keepers of the culture, the founders of the way that the employees treat each other and also the gatekeepers in the early stages to finding, attracting, and hiring the very best talent that aligns with the culture and the skills necessary for growth.The This is why it pains me to think that other startup leaders may have forgotten their charge, their responsibility to their growing teams and have relegated these things to middle-managers or have possibly turned a blind-eye to the hiring process allowing them to cite something to the effect of plausible deniability.I want my two girls to follow their own path towards success and if that means joining the technology world (I’m So, again, it starts with me and the companies that I create, that I lead, and I, like many of my colleagues and friends have never once thought: “I’m sorry for GitHub, for Julie, and for everyone else who has been directly impacted by this very real and very broken relationship. I do not blame either party nor can I possibly judge either of them since I simply do not (and will never) have enough information to make an objective decision.The part that I can play is making sure that I advocate an egalitarian environment through my actions, thoughts, and deeds through the leadership roles that I have been entrusted with.And, on occasion, writing frankly about it so that I can encourage others to do the same.[This post was originally published on my personal blog: People 

Life is made of chapters and “Since I was very young I always liked to build things. I think I was 6 when I went with my grandfather to the train factory he managed. Despite all the big trains and electricty stuff (which I loved), what really impressed me was his passion and how other people respected him. It was that day that, without even being aware, I decided to become an entrepreneur and build something to make him proud.In September 2013 I quit my job on a top startup in Lisbon, In theory, I was on a good position to start a company: I was familiar with the Lean Startup methodology, having won the first Lean Startup Machine 2012 in Lisbon; had worked in a startup before (UniPlaces) and was a good software engineer. All these factors made me think that I would not make some mistakes first time founders do. Without even realizing, I was underestimating the challenges that were in front of me. How could I possibly have thought about this? What was I thinking? Looking back this was probably the biggest mistake I made.When we started Wazza, my co-founder was still doing his thesis. I understood how important finishing it was for him, so I gave him time to end it. Due to this, we didn’t work together physically most of the time. I thought I could handle most of work but I was not prepared for an unexpected “guest” — loneliness. I had already experienced it during my master thesis at some point but this time it was a lot more intense. The early days of starting a company are complete chaos and full of doubt. I was lucky to be in Startup Lisboa, a top incubator in Lisbon where I could chat with fellow founders but it was not the same thing. Countless times I felt lost and with no idea were to go next, what to try or not. It was like sailing on the sea on a fishing boat, during a storm, without a compass. Got the picture?When starting a company it is crucial for founders to work side by side every day. When creating something new, you will feel and be lonely most of the time. Don’t underestimate it like I did.In May 2014, we got accepted in After almost losing my life in that accident I started to look at things differently. Suddenly, I started looking for a purpose in everything I did and the same applied to my startup. The problem was: I couldn’t see our purpose, our mission. All great companies have a clear mission that they want to see in this world. Think about PayPal, Facebook, Apple, SpaceX, Skype for example. Each and everyone had a big clear mission in order to change a part of this world and they did it. A company without a mission is like a boat without a compass. I realized this after a one week trip on San Francisco and Silicon Valley. It was another sign that we weren’t going the right way.Nothing was bad though! In September 2014 we got the news that we had won the Vienna Startup award. This award was a project of Pioneers and Vienna Business Agency where they selected two startups from all over the world to come to Vienna and expand their business. We were excited of course, winning is always good! On the months before going to Vienna, I realized we were struggling to sell our payment analytics product to the customer segment we had identified (mobile app developers). Due to this, we agreed that Vienna would be the live or die. In other words, either we get traction and start closing customer or we close the company.In Vienna we got outstanding support from the Pioneers and Vienna Business Agency. They helped us by opening doors to a new bigger customer segment (payment providers and banks), making introductions to key contacts and giving us relevant feedback and suggestions. Between hundreds of emails and countless meetings I began to see that there was no positive evolution: no one was jumping at us and saying “I need that, I’m going to buy it!”. The time for a decision was coming: continue or close.After coming back to Lisbon I was clear to me that we hadn’t accomplished our objectives. I had to put my passion and emotion aside and see things in a very objective and analytical way. It was the end of line for Wazza. We had a good product but no clear evidence that things would be better in the future. The way was right in front of us: close the company. Like all big choices in life this was a hard one to make, due to all the history and work I’ve put into it. However, sometimes you need to leave your emotions aside and have the humility and courage to do what is necessary. It hurts but it makes you stronger than you could possibly imagine. True winners are not the ones who never fall but those who fall and rise, again and again.Founding Wazza was a great experience. I met so many brilliant people, learned so much, in so many different areas that, in spite of the company not achieving the success I had hoped, I won more than I lost. I want to thank everyone that helped me along this path.For now, I am taking a little break to rest, refocus and think about what I’m going to do next. I’ve fallen this time, but I will rise again wiser and stronger.Tech Entrepreneur | Founder of Wazza.io | Ex Software Eng 

In the early days, a startup’s values and culture — the As new people join the team, the essence will transfer by osmosis. It’s in the air. The essence will be picked up through the sheer amount of time a small team will spend working on tough things together, and will evolve as new people contribute their own ideas and styles.As the team grows larger and as things move faster, you can no longer rely on your values being passively picked up by others.This is the problem we faced at In this post we’ll talk about:At We started to feel the pain of At this stage, these issues were starting to impact our performance.But if we left it unchecked? Our work would become less fun and less meaningful. We wouldn’t be able to attract and retain great people. We wouldn’t be able to build a great company.We needed to get everyone back to our roots and capture the core essence of what made Kayako, Kayako. ASAP.We’ve all seen company values before. But what makes some company values effective, and others not? Why do some company values turn into a religion, but some end up as little more than wall decoration?We spent some time researching and talking through this question with others. We found that some of the best and most effective company values had the following traits:Values should be lived and breathed in the literal sense.We picked up a nice anecdote from the book We found that some of the best company values were great levellers in this respect. Google’s “Don’t be evil” value is felt deeply by its employees, who use it to check their moral compass when making decisions, and who are empowered to call others out — no matter what their pay grade (prepare to be called out using your own values.)Values should act as a touchstone that helps everyone keep a check on whether they are doing the Without getting too tactical at this stage, another thing we noticed was that the best weaponizable values were written in a way that they could slot into day to day vocabulary, like in the Google anecdote above, or like our favorite example from the This ability to use the values verbatim increases the likelihood that they would feature on the ground, in conversations and in slide decks.These are really powerful forces. Without a strong set of values to build your company culture on, these competing forces will start to chip at your company culture.Startups will go really tough times — it’s almost a statistical certainty. When reading Ben Horowitz’s book What makes values strong? We generally found this links back to 1There isn’t much point in documenting the kind of things good people will default to doing anyway. However, there are some exceptions: Google didn’t really think anyone would be evil, but acknowledged the forces of running a huge business and maximizing profit may start to compromise instinctive good values, so while “Don’t be evil” may not necessarily be motivational, it was there to head off potentially distracting forces in the future.We followed a With a few founding members and a new senior hire, we kicked off an exercise to paint a picture of where we would like to be in the next 1–5 years.To capture our company values, we then asked ourselves this: Or in other words, what does a high performance culture look like to Kayako?We ended up with a long list of opposites: the positive traits that would help us fulfil our vision and achieve a high performance culture, as well as the antonym of those traits — the things that would hold us back.Our thinking was that we would assess this world of traits, and draw from it a set of To make sure we were being representative of the whole company, we invited a cross-section of the team (~20 people in total) to prioritize the all the traits that they felt were either most Surely, this would give us a fully representative Not even close.Acumen, ownership, embracing change, curiosity, clarity, transparency, courage and passion.Meh. Shrug.We couldn’t We managed to create a set of flat, lifeless and generic values. But how, with so much of We identified three missteps:These were obvious missteps in hindsight — we had set ourselves up for failure. Time to rethink.This time, we did the opposite of a committee approach. We gave one person ownership of capturing our values. This was a leadership problem and needed leadership, not a committee.Rather than getting These are the questions we looked to answer:We came up with lots of answers. Whatever came to mind when specifically answering these questions (ideally with plenty of colorful adjectives), we jotted down in a This process took about three weeks; enough time for enough scenarios and milestones to come up and go by, enough time to reflect and unpick things. I’m sure that if we were a smaller team, we could have accomplished this much more quickly.These answers became our working collateral. The full universe of traits, behaviours and adjectives which we would now funnel and distil into our core values.We iterated on these answers, reducing the various phrases into better, more concise phrases. With each iteration, we kept asking why: If the answer to This process needs This really is a process of staring at a bunch of phrases and adjectives for a while, until a lightbulb lights up.We continued to iterate, simplify and refine the language we captured in our Hackpad. Shuffling things around, bucketing different phrases and traits together, etc.We invited some select people to comment directly on the Hackpad with their interpretation of them after reading these early drafts. This was a very different approach to what we tried originally — we were getting feedback, but we were not forming committee. We continued this process until we got a consistent interpretation, which matched our original aim with the values.We continued this process until the values clicked with all of us.Here is what we came up with.For each value, we chose not just a short memorable sentence or word, but also language describing how those values might be played out in real life.We were inspired to use this ‘real life’ documentation of values style by the beautifully simple The first thing we did was prepare a slide deck, and not just because that is what the cool kids do. We needed to deliver these to the company and they needed to be delivered to everyone who joined Kayako.It is critical to have editorial control over how the values were documented, paced and presented (to an extent). There needs to be a sense of occasion to them, if we are in agreement that the values are one of the most important institutions in your company.The next thing we did was dedicate a company all-hands to these values.Step by step, we took the company through the mental journey we had been through to capture these. The observations that we made, the lightbulbs that went off, the ideas we threw away and the ideas that made it in, and why.We took everyone through how we were already demonstrating these values today, and where we had work to do.For us, the process was just as important as the output. We wanted to take everyone on the same journey (just with a few shortcuts which we discovered along the way).Results so far? It is too early to tell. We know that everyone is excited, we are on the same page and that’s enough to get going with.We don’t anticipate the fundamentals of our values changing much over time, but we are not freezing them.There’s a reason why we put a For us at Kayako, there is catch-up and a bit of a course correction to do. We can’t sprinkle values like pixie dust and say We would like to start capturing more of the Kayako culture and We’ll also be looking at how we can incorporate values into our recognitions system. 7geese, a goals and feedback management tool, has an interesting take on We are also exploring ways of really weaving in these values to our everyday surroundings. We really like the idea of creating some artwork to capture some of the values, like Facebook does. We don’t want to spoil them, though. There is a fine line between powerful and cheesy.The most important thing we have to do, though, will be letting our values dictate how we we hire, promote and let go. There is no better communication or embedding of values — everything else discussed in this section is just micro-optimization by comparison.We cannot give enough credit to the following companies, authors and speakers that inspired us with their own cultures, values and advice.Co-founder Stories about life, culture and working at Kayako.

Thoughts on the “Belgian Startup Manifesto”Let me first address the naming issue. I believe that calling it “As a technical person, I’m Most startups have a terrible culture, hostile against minorities and affected by what is known as the It’s not all good or all bad but startups are coming with their own set of problems and those need to be addressed. Sadly, a lot of theStartups are disrupting industries, little doubt about that (and there is more to come). Meaning millions more jobs will be lost worldwide because of these disruptions.What we notice is that startups are the But how are the disruptors treating us? Our relationship with Google is pretty close to the medieval feudal system. They provide us a service and in exchange we give them our data. The “digital knights” are in control, the vassals must abide by the dictated law (terms of services), do they really have a choice to enter that contract? Not really.The “digital knights” are currently disrupting the old world with no mercy, in the a very crusader-ish way. Cutting on millions of job world wide. The old world reacts by the worst possible way, banning the disruptors.There appears to be a pattern that holds for most industries.Think about it, whether it’s the music industry, taxi industry, banking industry… Now don’t get me wrong, Neither do I want to live in a world where we have to prevent disruptions from happening. They are going to happen and that’s ultimately a good thing. But what we need to do is adapt the legal framework along with it. If it’s taking 1000x less time to perform a specific amount of work, we can’t expect to have the entire population being active. A lot of jobs are going to be disrupted by robots or machine learning software, what we need are more engineers, designers, digital philosophers… to help us adapt to this new industry.The unconditional basic income, a better digital education, reforming taxation… are things to put on the table if we’re going to discuss how we can collectively benefit from disrupting the established companies.Crowdfunding is a great example of funding a company driven by consumer demand. By bringing back the user in the picture, entrepreneurs will be more incentized to satisfy him, rather than an investor.Open Whisper Systems, a collective of open-source developers I contribute to, has been experimenting with ideas like BitHub allows us to fund free and open-source software to which anyone can contribute and be funded by it, driven by bounties and market demand.Privacy to the people, transparency and accountability for public institutions is what we need to achieve. Governmental institutions should be There are so many areas where we could automate and disrupt governments the way we’ve been disrupting a lot of private industries. Yet, a crucial part is missing; how do we handle authentication? Governments should provide an “Identity API” for governmental and third-party services. We have the technology to build This authentication scheme is necessary if we’re going to bring our democracies online. Blockchain-backed authentication schemes are and will probably still be vulnerable to We can’t build any substantial web-driven innovation without Net Neutrality. If we’re not building for a free and open Internet, we’re stopping the disruption cycle and leaving uncontested monopoles flourish.If we’re going to live in a Free society, we better have more open-source software. Academia is a beautiful world. But sadly, the research done with public funding isn’t transmitted well enough to the industry (or sometimes not even useful).When I came out of high school, it striked me how restricted belgian parents were towards the educational choices of their kids. How many times have I not been told that attending “Solvay Business School” or going to Law school were the best option and seeing so many clueless end of high school students going into those studies just because it was believed to be “the good thing to do”. That’s not how you prepare high schoolers for the digital economy. Science and arts education is terribly underrated in Belgium, that’s really unfortunate. We don’t have enough engineers, neither do we have enough talented designers.Over the last few years, I’ve been repeatedly reporting vulnerabilities in information systems of both the private and public sector. It’s You might ask what this has to do with startups? Well, it turns out that the reasons most of our critical infrastructure is vulnerable is because government contractors belong to the old world. They failed to stay up to date with developments.Silicon Valley’s brogrammer mentality is solving a lot of issues for young white male communities, but there are so many more challenges to solve if we’re more inclusive.Writing a manifesto to facilitate innovation and entrepreneurship in Belgium? Hell yeah! But we can do something better than just cloning Surveillance Valley’s model that can’t really work anywhere else. Belgium has potential, tons of potential investors, brilliant cryptographers, designers, developers … but we need to coordinate all of this and make it frictionless to get started.Security Researcher

A friend of mine is learning to code. The other day he asked me…and as we discussed, I realized the answer wasn’t what he expected.In fact I think there are pretty significant differences between successfully applying to a startup and applying to a larger tech company — and most people applying to startups do it wrong.The audience for your startup job application is very different than that of a larger tech company. Large companies have recruiting teams and scalable hiring processes in place. At a startup, all hiring decisions are made by the founders, meaning it’s likely your application will be read by them first.This is definitely true at Sendwithus; all job applications go directly to me and my cofounder. We discuss internally and decide between us who to interview.The other key difference is in what startups are looking for in early employees. It’s often the case that culture fit and passion hold more weight than say, education or past work experience.I don’t mean “culture fit” in the typical sense of “we all drink craft beer and go hiking”. I mean real culture fit, where the team is passionate about what the company is doing and excited to work together. Founders will scan job applications searching for hints that you’ll be a great addition to the team.This can manifest itself in many ways. Does the applicant know what the company does? Do they understand the problems we’re trying to solve? Can they ship code and/or “get shit done”? These are some of the things we ask ourselves when reviewing applications.Applicants who haven’t made the effort to understand the company or demonstrate their passion are easy to identify and discard.With that in mind, here are some things I look for in great applications.Getting back to the original question, here’s the answer I gave my friend:Send a short email addressed to one or all founders by name. Explain why you want to work for them and be honest. Know what the company does and be excited about joining the team.Provide links to projects you’ve worked on and are proud of. They’re going to google you, make sure they see the great stuff first. If you don’t have anything to show, start working on something and show them your progress.Examples:Ask directly for a meeting or interview. You’re not going to get the job without meeting the team, so you need to suggest that as a next step.Provide some times in the next few days you’re available. Offer to meet them at their office, or on neutral grounds (coffee shop) close to their office.Ultimately, it’s about making it easy for the founders to make a decision. The easier it is for them to interview you and the harder it is for them to ignore how great you are, the more likely you are to get the job.cofounder @ sendwithus

We have been supporting founders and startups since 2012. First on a local level, by organizing startup events for our city of Rotterdam (the Netherlands) and eventually we got to cross borders. Somehow we skipped the national level, the Netherlands isn’t that big, and we didn’t like the competitive vibe it had at the time. Since 2013 we have been flying across Europe to do our workshops and events, and we noticed that we were privileged. We had the opportunity to see what was happening in the #startup scene, but most founders we met had no clue.Somewhere in the past year it hit me. The one thing we can help founders with, that is more scalable than the workshops and events we did, was connecting them. Connecting them and guiding them into coaching each other.Me and At the same time, we experimented with a method to keep our organisation in touch with each other. Since I am the chairman and the only person full time working on our efforts, we have a lot of volunteers from across the Netherlands and some from abroad. Slack became the tool to keep in touch, and we quickly added people who where building the startup community abroad. Even though those people weren’t a part of our team, we loved the fact that it would allow us to stay in touch in a non-obtrusive way. We had a Facebook group before, but we noticed a lot less activity there. After some research we soon realized that people see Facebook as a distraction to their work and therefore attempt to steer clear, whereas teams were already working on Slack.One day at the Rotterdam Startup Port (our small incubator/co-working space) we had a talk about how we were using Slack, and that a lot of communities use it, even though it is created for companies. I remember telling the rest I was very impressed with the way Pieter Levels created Nomad List (through collaborations with his target audience and an excel sheet) and his You see, what Raymond didn’t tell me was that Slack Chats was #1 on Product hunt, and it would remain there the entire day.I received close to three hundred emails in the following days requesting access. After dozens of replies, I started to sent people an application form made with We decided to curate who got access very early on, and eventually invited about 200 of the 300 emails we got that week. Around 150 founders actually joined #startup.Of all those new community members, a couple DM’ed me saying we should definitely post #startup to PH. I wasn’t so sure, but the idea struck a cord and I talked to some other founders about it. ‘If you have a decent landing page’, they said. So I made one, and got a domain: I shared the URL with some more peers in a DM on #startup, one of them was It felt good. Not because of PH, HN or Reddit and Betalist. But because we had found something, together with the community, that resonates with other founders. Because the community put in effort, made smart decisions, all without management. The community actually creates itself as it grows by the day and more amazing founders join. I’m just the monkey doing a dance and sending out invites.I didn’t expect us to reach #1 on Hacker News. But when we did we hoped to stay there for when the US would finally wake up, we didn’t. The worst part? We learned that if there are more comments on a post than there are up-votes, you lose that precious position. What was I doing? Replying to every single question that arose, naturally. Again, I didn’t even expect us to be there, but it sure hit me like a hammer when someone told me I was solely responsible when we ended up on page six.However, since this all started out as some experiment, an MVP if you will, we still had a blast. So how about those stats?In short we hit 11,012 uniques on that Typeform to date. From which we received 1,467 applications and a total of €1510,- (at 10,- each this boils down to roughly 10% of all applications choosing to contribute for an expedited review of their application). Also notice that almost everyone is on a PC or laptop, personally I resent some of the websites being re-made for tablets. I don’t see the majority of people do online banking or ordering groceries from their iPad. Have a look at The spike on Stripe’s dashboard is so big you can’t even see the payments made before the madness started.Between 10am and 12pm (GMT +1, NL) we were on the #1 postion on HN. This made the ‘America wakes up’ spike you usually directly see unnoticeable.But when we select all sessions from the states, you can definitely see its impact. For reference, when our time was 12pm, we just had the HN spike and it was 6am in NYC, and still 3am in the valley. From that point on however the traffic grew to almost the HN spike until 12am our time.And that is because most of the traffic came from the states.A specific state to be exact.We feel we validated the need, and that founders will pay for this service, and now, they will have to. We’re shutting down the option to provide a motivation and we will continue to research how we can best support founders in building more successful startups.While we appreciate the fact that so many applied and wrote often great motivations, most of the motivations were too generic. There are still too many left to screen. So no more. You either donate the small contribution, or get someone on the inside to vouch for you if you don’t have a credit card or can’t afford the contribution.Our time isn’t best filled with screening applicants, it is best filled with finding new opportunities to support founders, and executing on them.If you’re wondering if I’m going on a nice vacation soon or buying a new laptop, I say both! But not from the donations we have received. The funds will go to the Chairman Startup Foundation | Founded the SF Experience  An essential collection for the hustler, doer and dreamer in all of us.

In the past 5 years, I have been Chief Technical Officer of two startups — one, GoCar has been acquired and one, Solved, has been discontinued — and helped many others as a technical advisor. What characterizes startups is that they have to ship a lot of results with limited resources. As CTO, your daily job is to lead the technical team, set the goals and take the right technical decisions. You are in a constant tradeoff of immediate speed VS long-term productivity.In this article, I want to share 5 rules I follow in order to make my choices. So far, they enabled me to keep shipping while avoiding to pile up “technical debt”.The goal of any startup is to build a solution which will bring value to its customers. There are chances that your business co-founder will spend most of his/her time talking to them and understanding their needs. On this basis, your co-founder will set the priorities and report what customers’ problems are. Your role will be to find out and build an outstanding product that provides a solution to them.As a technical person, it is easy to get excited by a new technological challenge or a new service that looks promising. When it occurs to me, I ask myself this simple question: “What is the business outcome of what I am doing”. This way, I always know if I am working on the right priority or not.At Solved, we even dedicated a weekly meeting with my business co-founder, Thomas, where we were reviewing the features to ensure they match the business priorities. At any moment, I and any member of my dev team could say why we were working on any feature.In order to ensure I did a good job, I was asking myself: how will it delight our users? how will it help our startup to make money? or help our operations team? If you can also answer these questions for your own project, there are chances you are on the right track.In its early days, your startup’s main challenge is to find the product-market fit. That means that your product embryo might evolve in many different directions and it has to evolve fast. As you don’t know how long it will take to get traction, you have to balance short-term benefits as well as productivity in the long run.At the code level, I found out that the best way to do that is to organize my code in small, reusable modules that I can assemble like Lego bricks. It enables to quickly change the business logic and the flows of the app. In order to maintain a clean codebase, I never hesitate to throw away features that are not needed anymore.As an illustration, here our Trello Board at Solved, my previous startup:At the organization level, I put in place simple processes so that everybody knows what are the priorities and who is working on what. Most of the time a simple There has never been so many tools in a developer’s toolbox. You can choose to externalize most of your dev stacks or to develop every single tool yourself.At the beginning of your project, one of your main challenges will be to choose your stack. New tools and technologies have probably emerged since your last project. Should you choose a stack you already know or try a new one?I never underestimate this phase since it will influence the whole life of my startup. I’ve seen too many CTOs struggling because they chose the most “trending” tools without realizing what are the technical implications. It is not because everybody is using a tool that this tool will fit to one’s particular case. For every tool I consider, I do my best to understand what are the pros and the cons. If I only see pros, it is often a sign that I have not dug enough.For instance, I hear many developers thrilled by the power of MongoDB. So much that they use it in all their projects without realizing that it lacks of some SQL DB features they might need (think of the work required to maintain many-to-many relationships in Mongo). After a year spent coding, they are not taking advantages of Mongo and start struggling because they do not find the features required by their project. If they had taken the time to understand the pros and cons of each solution, they would have chosen the right DBMS from day one.In order to make the right choices, I take time to understand what are the specificities of my project and what tool will answer the best to these ones. I especially like to discuss with other people who have tried these tools.When it comes to hiring, you might be tempted to start with interns or junior developers since they are easier to recruit and are more affordable than senior programmers. However, with inexperienced recruits, you will end up spending more time training them than actually shipping code. Never forget your goal: being fast and flexible.I have experienced that hiring senior developers bring way more value to startups. Since I do not have to train them, I have more time for my own responsibilities. Moreover, they bring their own knowledge, their own tools and can help the team to take better decisions.I even try to hire developers that are better than me in domains I consider key for the startup. Since I do not know everything on every subject, I am delighted to delegate responsibilities to members of my team. However, I ensure to understand what they are doing so that I still have the big picture and can coordinate the team.At my previous startup, I had shortlisted two candidates who fitted to the team I wanted to create: one junior and a more senior (read 1 year vs 5 years experience). Choosing Never forget that the whole team is looking at you. You set the standards and best practices. Whatever you do or don’t do, your teammates will follow you.In order to ensure everybody speaks the same voice, I set up code policies and style guides at the very beginning of the project. I strongly believe in peer code reviews. It Here is an example of a typical pull-request at Solved:Finally, I’ve found very important to do things before delegating them. If I do not know what I am asking to my teammates, it is very difficult to discuss their choices and put the reflexion further. Even if I do not do the things as well as they would (that’s why I hired them), doing it by myself in the first place give me fine grasp of the challenges they are tackling.Learn how to attract your first customer in two days!Bi-monthly stories about code, tech and shared experiences.

I’m building a startup to help investors, acquirers, and service providers etc. connect with startups to do deals. Funding, MA, customer acquisition — these aren’t new things, but before Startups benefit from understanding that they have been tracked for some time in spreadsheets and CRMs. Judgement is being passed constantly, as your company is compared against others as a viable investment, acquisition, customer, and vendor. So why not take control of that perception by managing the signals you are sending?If you’ve ever announced funding for your company, you are probably familiar with the inflow of unsolicited outreach — some of which you want, and some that just feels like spam.A funding event that garners media coverage gets a lot of traffic because it presents business opportunities. Many startups naively believe all those website visitors and signups are potentials customers, and some are, but your startup is interesting to many others:Your funding isn’t just interesting for that day, the timing and participants also matter. Investors who like follow certain angels put you on a list of prospects, taking note of the date so they can contact you in 6-12 months to get a sense of traction since the announcement, and your timeline for taking more capital. Afterall, most startups raise money in predictable 18 month cycles — if they don’t they’re either a) profitable b) dead.Your competitors are also taking note, and if they’re interested in coming after you legally this is often when they’ll first consider it. You’ve raised money, and your existence is a threat. They’ll also take note of who invested (don’t talk to them!) and who you announce as customers (poach them!)In between funding events it can be a bit more challenging to figure out which companies are growing, but adding new employees is a good proxy. A spike in hiring, or even just a steady stream of new folks, can signal:Additionally, investors/acquirers/providers are often paying attention to who specifically is joining the company and how they are connected. Did you just land the person who used to run all of support for AirBNB? Did you poach the guy who did sales for Amazon Web Services and closed the most deals in their first year? Did you use a widely respected corporate recruiter who is known to service a select group of VC’s portfolio companies (and you haven’t announced that Sequoia backed you yet)?Discount them if you like, but whether your company gets mentioned regularly on Twitter and (to a lesser extent now that Pages for business has become crap) Facebook is very important to investors, especially in the early stages. Organic mentions of a company, whether positive or negative, signal that people at least care that you exist.Think this doesn’t matter for non-consumer products? Think again. People don’t tend to mention “boring” business tools on their personal social media accounts unless they’re pretty passionate about them (for example Understanding where a startup gets their traffic, a combination of advertising driving visitors and organic intent, is crucial to grasping the customer acquisition costs of a startup.To some extent companies can buy something that looks a lot like traction, but an addiction to paid traffic or paid placement in the iTunes app store is a huge problem if it doesn’t work — eventually these companies run out of the ability to pay for these things, and investors have become much more savvy. Startups in the past might have been able to convince acquirers and potential employees to respect these numbers, but with the tools being provided today they are beginning to see through this.Any single metric can be gamed, for awhile anyway, with slight mis-directions that eventually fall apart or devolve to bald faced lies.But if you “game” several of these metrics at the same time by improving them every single week, your startup just might be doing well.CEO  Cofounder of Exploring the world of high growth Internet companies, one story at a time.

Καλησπέρα, είμαι ο Νίκος και είμαι entrepreneur απο την εποχή που τα startups λεγόντουσαν απλά web sites, τουλάχιστον στον δικό μου κόσμο. Μιά μέρα διαπίστωσα πως υπάρχουν και άλλοι 6–7 στην πόλη μου που ασχολούνται με τα ίδια πράγματα και ήταν κάτι σαν πολιτισμικό σόκ.Fast forward μερικά χρόνια και μία κρίση μετά πηγαίνω σε startup events και βλέπω 400 άτομα που ασχολούνται με την περιβόητη επιχειρηματικότητα και καινοτομία. Βγάζοντας ένα μεγάλο ποσοστό αυτών που είτε δεν έχουν μπεί ακόμα στον κόπο να επιχειρήσουν ή έχουν τους δικούς τους σκοπούς, ή απλά κόβουν κίνηση, γενικώς είμαι αρκετά αισιόδοξος γιατί πλέον ως entrepreneur μπορείς να έχεις βοήθεια απο fellow founders όπως λένε και στο valley.Παρόλο που το οικοσύστημα μεγαλώνει με ρυθμούς πολύ καλύτερους απο ότι θα φανταζόμουν πρίν 6 χρόνια, μέσα σε όλη αυτή την παραφωνία του startup buzz έχω διακρίνει μία αρκετά μεγάλη μερίδα ανθρώπων που χαρακτηρίζουν απόλυτα την έννοια του νεοέλληνα: δηλαδή του τυπά που θεωρεί οτι ο κόσμος του χρωστάει και πίσω απο όλα υπάρχει μία συνωμοσία.Εσύ που ξέρεις ποιός είσαι, άκου λίγο. Όταν δεν υπήρχαν funds το πρόβλημά σου ήταν οτι δεν έβρισκες funding. Φυσικά και τότε υπήρχαν χρήματα (σε άλλες χώρες) για αυτούς που είχαν να προσφέρουν κάτι ουσιαστικά καινούριο (==καινοτομία) Μετά ήρθαν τα funds και τώρα το πρόβλημα είναι πως αυτοί δίνουν μόνο στους “δικούς τους”. Ενδιάμεσα σε αυτά τα προβλήματα είναι το οτι τίποτα δεν γίνεται σωστά στην Ελλάδα, η κυβέρνηση δεν βοηθάει, ο κόσμος είναι χαζός που δεν αγοράζει την φανταστική σου υπηρεσία που πουλάνε άλλα 10.000 μαγαζιά, κοκ.Απο την άλλη αν είσαι ερωτευμένος με αυτό που κάνεις και κολλάς στο ότι δεν έχεις τις κατάλληλες διασυνδέσεις, μάντεψε τί θα κάνεις: ΔΙΑΣΥΝΔΕΣΕΙΣΑν ο Γάτος τρέχει το incrediblue με κλεμμένα λεφτά ή το taxibeat μεταφέρει ναρκωτικά για να βγάλει τα έξοδα του αυτό δεν έχει καμία σχέση με τους δικούς σου στόχους.Οποιος θέλει να είναι επιχειρηματίας το μόνο που χρειάζεται είναι να επιχειρεί αδιάλειπτα μέχρι να ικανοποιήσει την περιέργεια ή οποιοδήποτε άλλο κίνητρο έχει για να το κάνει. Τα υπόλοιπα είναι απλά φυσικό επακόλουθο. Σε έναν κόσμο που υπάρχουν τύποι που Όπως λέει και ο σοφός λαός όσα δεν φτάνει η αλεπού τα κάνει κρεμαστάρια. Για τους υπόλοιπους δεν νομίζω να υπήρχε ποτέ καλύτερος καιρός για να ξεκινήσεις κάτι.Αυτά τα λίγα, now let’s get back to workfounder of 

I’m part of a small group of startup PMs that meets up every 1-2 months to share, debate, encourage, rant, laugh, cry; and one direction our conversation often steers is the tools that startup PM’s should use to optimize their jobs and their organizations’ product development processes (in the absence of big company internal resources and pre-existing processes). While there are tons of helpful tools available on the market (Asana/Jira/Trello, Optimizely, Mixpanel, etc), there’s also a lot of Google-doc, wiki, excel, ppt, and internal tools going on.So I thought it’d be fun to share a few helpful tools but also to dream a bit about what things could look like in 5 years’ time.Honorable Mention: #optimizely, #kahuna, #searchman, #appannie.Thoughts?

This week I decided to share a side project that I’ve been working on for over a year, prototype and all. It’s always nerve-wracking to share something you’ve worked so hard on. But in this case, I’m risking more than just the scrutiny of my peers.That’s because I have yet to find a developer to start building it. I’m not the most connected person in the world of startups and mobile development, and finding the right person has been a challenge. In an uber competitive space where every advantage could make or break your product, I know revealing anything before the home stretch comes with serious risk.So why would I do such a thing? Well, I truly believe what I’m working on can make the lives of others better. There have been too many times where I could have used this to spend more time with those who matter to me. There are too many people who can live better lives by using it.I’m more afraid of it never existing than someone stealing my idea. I’ve poured my heart and soul into this project for over a year. Wouldn’t it be a shame if nothing ever came of it?Simply put, the cost of it never existing is too high.Product designer who’s more not stupid than smart. Advocate for giving a damn. 

I was struck this morning by a post from Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky. In Every communication we as investors have with entrepreneurs is an opportunity to impress professionalism, thoughtfulness, value add, and respect for their hard work. We are privileged to partner with companies that are building the world of tomorrow. I know most of us behave that way, but a healthy reminder never hurt.It’s our responsibility to give clear feedback to entrepreneurs on why we make the decisions we do. Not every opportunity is investable. In fact, fewer than 1% of the deals ever are. Thoughts or comments? Ping me on Investing in tech companies 

Over the last few years, I’ve been grappling with a completely different problem from anything I’ve dealt with before:My background is all startup. And, when I say startup, I mean three, five, or eight people, not 200 — that’s a fully functioning business in my mind. I sold my last one to salesforce.com, which is from where I’m drawing my experiences.One thing I always hear in big companies is: How are you going to scale that? In fact, it’s an obsession. The reality, however, is that “scale” is often the last problem you have, especially in a large company.You need to build scale. It doesn’t just happen.What do I mean by scale? Rather than working with the marketing team to make some materials for you, make them yourself. Rather than trying to find ways to train the professional services teams on something that hasn’t yet been released, release it yourself and work the rest out later. Rather than worrying about training the global sales team, work with a small team and get busy working with customers. That may sound irresponsible, but it’s actually the right thing to do.I see so many initiatives fail because no one really wants to get down and dirty to make things happen. They want the organization to adapt to their way of thinking — jumping in with both feet. It is incredibly challenging to build enough consensus to “train your company” to listen to you and trust that you have the right idea.If you want it to work, make it work, and leverage the organization to fill in as it grows. That’s where you get scale. You have an organization at your disposal to grow the idea, with a lot of professional people. Leverage that on-demand.If it doesn’t grow, they were right. If it does, they’ll make it right.The trick, and one I’m slowly mastering, is keeping enough people on your side to support you — a team below and beside. “Executive air cover” above is also critical.Which leads me to…Everything is a shade of grey when you have as diverse a customer base as most large companies do. Every market is the next big thing, every idea is the next big idea, everyone is full of ideas for right ways and wrong ways of doing things.The trouble with big companies is that everyone has a different perspective — and very few people come from the same one. Clearly, different perspectives can be a strength, but too many creates division. Also, you may be wrong given yours. Remember, your company is doing a lot more than you can comprehend holistically.However, the ideas I’ve seen succeed are always based on strong and well-understood customer references. This is by far your biggest trump card — in meetings, in discussions, in validation. Not stats, not research, not opinions, but customers.If you can show customer interest, that is the most powerful answer.But this is no cake walk…I’ve never heard of anyone successfully creating and launching an idea fueled by the power of consensus. Lots of people are going to hate your idea, hate that you’re leading it, and hate that it’s ruining the work they’re doing. No matter what you’re doing, you’re going to be stepping on someone else in the process. Get over it.However, remember that growing a company is a team sport. You will never be successful if you don’t have people above, below, and beside you that want you to succeed. As a result, make sure you’re not “running around with sharp sticks” and creating an all-around blood bath. Be positive, be respectful, but be clear and focused with your intentions.Everyone likes clarity and purpose. Make sure you’re providing it.And that’s where the next observation comes in…Iterating and developing an idea with others can often be perceived as “flip-flopping.” That is to say: You’re uncertain in your position on the right answer. In most startups I’ve worked for or run, transparency is key, and iterating and refining is the name of the game.You need to work to a long game (which could be years), “triangulate” to get a depth of understanding, share ideas with a small group of trusted colleagues, and then start the relentless campaign to win.Do not change your position.Whether you know it or not, people will start to come on board, or not, with what you’re saying. If you change the story, you’ll lose trust as people will no longer understand what your position is. Remember, they’re not paying nearly as much attention to this as you, so you need to keep things simple, clear, and constant. Even if you see problems arise in your approach, maintain the lock on your target and just keep going.But move fast. Once you start pushing, you need decisions to be made quickly to show momentum and endorsement.Especially as…Don’t assume that people are listening to anything you’re saying. Many decisions are made simply because people like and trust you. Others will agree with you simply because they don’t have an opinion; others because they just want you to shut up and go away. What you can be sure of is: Very few, if anyone, really cares.They’re going to get paid regardless of your success or failure. The one thing that does motivate decisions is their career (and yours too, by the way, or why else would you be doing this? Really, I mean, dig deep now… If you really cared, you’d do it as an actual startup). Make sure you’re respectful of their career.There’s another side to this. If you, like me, tend to get passionate about things (or put more accurately, stubborn), be careful. If you push too hard, you’ll end up alienating others from you and being seen as someone who “doesn’t play well with others.” I’ve noticed people generally won’t push back, even when they completely disagree with what you’re saying. They don’t push back, because they don’t care, but they’re doing you damage.One thing you can be certain of, however, is that everyone likes a clear vision and mission. Clarity and purpose are your most valuable alignment tool.Which makes me think of one more important alignment tool…I came into this education via an acquisition. Acquisitions are a great way to create a focal point and gravitational force around which your idea can grow. I think people often don’t realize this. They think that acquisitions are purely to fill a skills gap or accelerate a product. The reality is that many acquisitions simply give the company something to focus on.Buying a company creates a nucleation site for your vision. If you’re a beer drinker like me, that’s the place in your glass where the bubbles grow and create the fizz.Dad, entrepreneur, ☁ platform geek, guitar player, can play well with others, executive

There are more than four rules, of course. I don’t know how many there are in total. But I do know these four are important. They are what I would tell myself if I could go back five years.And so,Dear younger Paul,This wasn’t an easy lesson to learn. Before founding Learndot (“Matygo” at the time), I was a Computer Science student at UBC. The school had standardized on the Blackboard Learning Management System and, like most students, I hated it. It was buggy, slow, and looked like it was designed by same team as Windows ME. In my third year I got a job as a TA and made a life-changing discovery: Instructors were just as frustrated with Blackboard as students.This was life-changing because it’s what gave me the idea to build an alternative. It wasn’t a grand vision. I wasn’t thinking about raising money or marketing or “business development” or any of that (I knew nothing about those anyway at the time). But I did want to make my life a bit easier and since I was decent at web programming, thought I’d take a stab at building something. So I recruited my childhood friend Joe and we got to work. Nine months later, we launched version one. It wouldn’t load in IE, was brutally slow in Firefox, and crashed mobile browsers.But we kept iterating and soon we fixed the major compatibility issues, improved performance, and added mobile apps. In two semesters we went from piloting with 200 students to serving over 10,000 students across Canada. No sales, no marketing, just two friends solving a problem they knew intimately. In retrospect, it’s crazy to think that two students built a product in nine months that beat out a billion-dollar company’s flagship solution. But software is like that. We understood our users because we Unfortunately, we got this right by accident. We hadn’t actually learnt the rule yet. That would change as soon as we stopped dogfooding and started waffling instead. The first problem was inevitable — Joe and I graduated. Short of starting a PhD, we had few options to maintain our personal use case. The next crisis came only a few months after graduation. We joined an accelerator and faced the reality that our product was supposed to be a business if we were going to raise money. It’s a long story, but suffice it to say that our attempts to monetize our University LMS were entirely unproductive. So we started pivoting.What followed were turbulent years of indecision and false starts. We finally found our way out of the forest by focusing on something we needed ourselves, customer education for SaaS companies. We were, after all, a SaaS company.When you’re building a product, empathy is your compass and passion is your engine. Empathy is how accurately you feel what users feel. Passion is how badly you need to see your solution in the world. Both grow in direct proportion with how closely you connect to your product, so it’s pretty clear that there’s a simple method to nurture both: build for yourself.Tech progresses in macro waves and as each wave rumbles in, a new generation of winners are launched.Note that none of these companies would have succeeded had they been born earlier than they were. Uber would have failed in 2001, Facebook in 1992, and Apple in 1970. Each wave opens up previously hidden opportunities for solutions to old problems. And even if you aren’t destined to be a mega-winner, getting in front of the next tsunami gives you a huge advantage. Your platform’s growth is your growth. A rising tide may lift all boats, but your boat has to be in the right ocean.So how do you ride the wave while building for yourself? Be selective and perceptive. Then, when the right one comes, you will know.After years of building personal gizmos, when Woz heard about the MOS 6502 processor he knew he could build the personal computer he always wanted. Jeff Bezos, a bookworm, realized in 1994 that the internet would allow for stores with 100x more inventory than brick-and-mortars, so he built himself a better bookstore. Zuckerberg, a young web programmer, started developing thefacebook to help him and his college friends connect online just as the Web was becoming truly mainstream and the dot-com hype had worn off.So what could be your wave? Here are a few big trends I’m watching (today in February 2015).The human condition doesn’t change much. Great products solve problems that have existed for eons. They find latent human need. Your grandparents’ grandparents should have an analogy for what your product does.A few examples:To put it it simply: if a problem is big enough to be worth solving, there’s already a solution for it. This is true for both business and consumer products.If this sounds obvious, try this: Next time you find yourself at a startup event, plastic glass of wine in your hand, listening to elevator pitches, see if you (or better yet, the founder) can make a grandparents’ grandparents analogy for what the product does. It’s really hard for most pitches but surprisingly easy for great ones.— Daniel Burnham, Chicago Architect, 1907Three questions:We know the answers, of course. NASA put a man on the moon, the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit, and a selfie-taking rover on Mars. Google X is working to coat the entire planet with internet, embed computers in contact lenses, and is leading the development of self-driving cars. The head of Google X, Astro Teller’s title is literally “Captain of Moonshots”.Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s vision for SpaceX is “to make the human race an interplanetary species”. Which is crazy, yet not as crazy as the fact that they might actually do it. As an entrepreneur, you are always selling your vision. You sell it to the investors, to potential employees, to your customers, and to yourself. Your job is to get hearts pounding and imaginations whirling. No one wants to be part of little plans. There’s no magic in them. So don’t make them.One more time, with feelingThe truth is I really am writing this for myself. These lessons kept reaffirming themselves through punishment, so I thought it might be prudent to document them. My experience for the past few years was startup-land, but I suspect they’ll apply just as well to Product Management and probably a lot of other situations in life as well. Here’s hoping they might bring you some good too. When ambitious products get built that solve basic problems with our most advanced technology, everybody wins.Feel free to reach out if I can be helpful.

About two months ago we started a service called When we launched it I read two interesting posts which inspired me to share our own experiences. A post from Ryan Hoover about how his team managed to Over the last two months we started to add more and more users and lately reached the 10,000 users mark on journi. If this wasn’t enough to celebrate, Apple reached out for a featuring. This made me reflect about what we did to get there and build our first crowd to get journi off the ground.The service was called miavia (which is Italian and stands for “my way”) attracted 800 users on the creator side in 10 months. We tried a lot to get more users, but miavia wouldn’t get off the ground. We couldn’t really nail the creator’s side to get more content.Looking more carefully into how people were using miavia we saw that our users were mainly documenting their own trips and only sharing them with friends and family instead of publishing it on our marketplace to earn something. So we decided to pivot and concentrate on the issue of journaling or actually capturing whole trips in a more automatic way.We quickly tested the idea with a few users and the positive feedback was overwhelming. So we decided to start building journi.The decision to focus only on this particular problem, instead of figuring out two sides of a marketplace also made it possible to focus on a specific niche. The target user was super clear for us now. The early prototype was not fully functional. We added the features step by step and tested each of them separately so we could figure out whether it was worth to integrate it. This was an ongoing process for almost 3 months. It also helped us understand what their issues were, what they needed and how we could communicate our solution in the most effective way.With our test users we really created a family environment. They felt super important and honored to help us. In fact they got really excited about the new product and were feeling like a part of it.To make this last test as effective as possible we made a game out of it. Each test user who would find an issue that could be replicated earned one Schnaps, served at our launch party. This game totally paid off and made us find every tiny bug.By then we also started to communicate the upcoming changes to our existing miavia users. We wanted them to be the first to know about what’s coming. We addressed each of our users with a personal email explaining why we are doing this and what’s going to happen with the user accounts and the content. In two other emails we reminded them that the launch is coming closer and that miavia will be taken down. As a little extra we revealed parts of journi to give them a feel of what it will offer and how they will benefit from the new service. Finally we managed to turn almost all miavia users into journi users.In the middle of June we were ready to launch and bring journi in the Apple App Store. By then our test users, the miavia users and all the others who had heard about journi were already super excited and curious.The night before the launch a group of people (don’t know who) managed to tag our logo and URL with chalk spray on streets and walkways all around the city. It seemed to work pretty well as we heard people talking on the streets and posting pictures on Facebook and Twitter.In the early morning of the launch day we sent out an email notification to our test users and miavia users presenting the final app. We kindly asked them for a rating on the App Store and to share journi with their friends. By the end of the week we got 40 five star ratings in the App Store.Everyone started the day with targeting their own social media channels.With a nice email we also managed to get featured on all the info screens in the public transport system in Vienna. And after the first week we got our first 1,000 users.Then it was time for us to move to San Francisco because we managed to get selected for the Plug and Play Tech Center accelerator program. The program is run together with the Austrian Trade Commission. It gave us the ability to get closer to the US market and connect with the local startup scene to pitch and learn.Analyzing the first results, we quickly realized that the referrals didn’t seem to work as we expected. It was to hard for users to invite friends. Fixing that became our number one priority on the design and development side.So Carina started to engage our users on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and our blog with topcis including feature presentations, team news, travel quotes or user featurings etc.At the beginning we covered all channels and tried to figure out what are the most important ones for us to communicate to and eventually also acquire new users. Now we mainly concentrate on Facebook, Twitter and our Blog.Another important way of building our community and showing respect to our early users was personal emails. Whenever we got a feedback mail one of our team members would answer within 24 hours.Wherever we could we offered a feedback channel. At the end of each email users receive from us, we remind them that they can contact us by just hitting reply. In the settings of the app we put a large feedback button and also in some particular events we actively ask for feedback in the app.In addition to that we actively reached out to very active users for featuring their public trips or if we saw that we got an email complaint, we asked why this happened and if there were any issues.Beside that, the team members regularly went to startup and travel events like couchsurfing, pub crawls, expat meetups, etc. to be in touch with the local travel scene.In Europe, when I ask startup folks, how they gonna grow, they often seem to be chilled. They refer to social media campaigns, viral videos, ads, or the one guy they are going to hire, who knows everything about marketing and will take care of growth. The majority of Europeans are excellent engineers but they are really bad in selling and distributing things.Nailing the product is one thing, building it for the user is another, but bringing it to the user is a totally different thing.People have to understand that there is nothing like the one single growth engine. Successful companies apply a selected mix of them or different ones at different growth stages.Ian Hogarth, a YC alumni and co-founder of Songkick recently talked about the main techniques a startup could use to grow: The only thing I was missing, or maybe he put that under the paid section is “(incentives for) referrals”. Airbnb is a good example for a startup that applied all of these techniques.Ian also mentioned that Growth doesn’t necessarily happen when you focus on growth only, startups also have to provide a good product and in order to survive, they need to find a way how to make money.Thomas Schranz a friend from another Austrian Startup blossom.io and one of our early test users introduced us to Product Hunt in May and offered to feature journi once we are ready. So reached out to Thomas again and we agreed that he posts on Wednesday early in the morning PST, as this seemed to be the perfect time to attract lots of people. I also prepared a first comment to share some more insights with the users.Our launch on PH was amazing. journi was upvoted best product of the day. Not only did we get a lot of feedback, we got 1,000 sign-ups within 3 days. With the featuring we also got a lot of additional coverage in smaller blogs and as one of the ten best weekly products we were covered in the PH weekly newsletter again.To test the changes in the app we had to get new people into the funnel and start our growth engines again. In order to grow faster we combined multiple growth engines:1) Do another launch. This time on Hacker News. We managed to be on the front page of Hacker News for about 4 hours and on the Show HN section for about 2 days. Hacker News didn’t bring as many new users as Product Hunt, yet they seemed to be more active from what we saw in analytics.2) Bianca also published her design work for journi on 3) This was also the first time we actively reached out to various blogs and got a lot of media coverage in Austria (e.g. derstandard, horizont, futurezone) and in the travel scene (e.g. skift and tnooz).4) Last but not least we started to post in various Facebook Groups (Exchanges Students, Au pairs, Backpacker Groups, Travel and Work, etc.). This turned out to be a total success. We added hundreds of users each day. The key here was definitely the wording, which was very personal. We also included our email addresses for feedback or in case anybody just wanted to say “hi”.Also the changes that we made in the app finally had an impact on user growth. The referrals increased by over 120% per week.To do the first one right, we would have to build the app perfectly for the user AND for Apple. So this was always something Bianca carefully considered when designing the app.And I actively reached out to Apple the first time in June shortly before we launched, inviting some Apple guys to Testflight to try the app. Out of 10 emails only one guy responded and showed some interest. But in the end he never tried the app.With the second version being ready I send him another email. I told him about our progress and that we would be happy about feedback on our iOS8 features.Surprisingly I quickly got a response and he connected me with the guys in charge for the App Store in Europe. They really liked the app and were curious about our upcoming plans for the next release in September and what iOS8 features the app is going to support.We quickly outlined our road map and answered their questions, including some screenshots for the next release. After two weeks we received the one official email that we were hoping for: An email from Apple App Store, concerning a featuring of journi in the App Store.Soon we are going to launch our third version, which will apparently be featured on the App Store bringing thousands of new users.We haven’t yet reached our tipping point. There’s still a windy road ahead. Some smart and skeptical entrepreneurs shared their concerns:While we don’t have a clear answer to all these questions, we do know why we started journi: We saw that people who travel don’t want to share everything on Facebook, they don’t want to be online all the time, they don’t want to have all the troubles that come with running a blog.They want that remembering and sharing is as simple as taking a picture and feels so beautiful and valuable like a photo book. People are willing to pay for a service like this.And we do know that we have had an amazing launch so far and we do know how to grow it further. Over the last 2 months, the service attracted about 10,000 users. And the run has not yet stopped. We keep adding new ones and see users being super engaged, using the app in so many new ways we would have never thought about. And with every moment created on journi they seem to love it more.Yet, it is interesting to see that journi is also polarizing and standing out of the crowded market. journi makes people interested and they talk about it. And we hope it will go on like that, as some of the greatest products of our time were born this way.journi has definitely captured the attention of the early adopters in the travel scene, but we believe there is even a bigger opportunity there. The time has come to use modern technology that helps us in creating and managing travel data more efficiently. And our vision is to build these products and services with the goal of creating a better travel experience for billions of travelers.Co-founder and CEO of Journi – a social travel journal that makes sharing and remembering travel experiences effortless.

Entrepreneurs are always looking for opportunities for building platforms that will disrupt the current way of how industries do business. One such trend that has clearly caught up among the entrepreneurs is executing ideas described as “Uber for X or AirBnB for Y”.There should not be any negative connotation associated with these terms. You are attempting an Offline-online integration in a niche vertical and removing inefficiencies in the existing value chain. These analogies help you to describe the value proposition and high level model in a simplistic manner without having to write 100 lines of explanation. Why these are becoming such hot trends is because all the tech (ubiquitous smartphones and connected technology) and non-tech pieces (changing consumer behaviour and more flexible employment patterns) have fallen in place enabling the revolution.Before I list the startups working on Uber for X/On-Demand platforms -List of StartupsPowering On Demand AppsUber for X is the phenomena wherein a platform aggregates/generates demand on mobile devices which is then fulfilled by offline service providers. Also known as an On Demand Service, these platforms employ a full cycle approach to provide end to end convenience to the customer.

Storytelling is the defining skill of successful entrepreneurs. Some people think that technical brilliance, deep-seated passion, or unambiguous hustle are the most important founder traits. All of these certainly help. But the top 1% of founders distinguish themselves by their ability to weave a good tale.There’s a very mundane reason for this. At the fuzzy front end of building a new company, most of what the CEO does on a daily basis is tell stories. Founders must lure investors to write them checks, convince friends and colleagues to join up, inspire their team to perform in the face of adversity, attract customers who have better things to do, and collaborate with partners whose goals may very well be divergent. That’s a prolific amount of storytelling even for an author like myself.If storytelling is so important, why do most founders suck at it? Crappy stories hamstring otherwise stellar startups all the time. Companies flounder in shallows. Missed opportunities pile up like debris after a hurricane. The good news is that improving your story might not take a lot of effort but could yield surprising results.Remember that high school teacher that made advanced algebra the most exciting item on the menu? Or the other teacher that somehow made World War II incredibly boring? Enthusiasm is contagious. Be yourself. Tell the truth. If you believe in what you’re doing then all you have to do is make yourself vulnerable and others will catch the bug. Let your passion peek through your professionalism.Storytelling is a craft. Just like product development, you have to improve your story through practice, feedback, and iteration. What points does your audience engage with the most? Give them more of what they want. What moments light a spark in their eyes? Double down. When do they start to nod off? Cut! Pixar has axed multiple films late in their development because they simply weren’t up to snuff. You wouldn’t release a product that sucked. Bring that same level of quality control to the stories you share.A demo is sexier than a description. A customer testimonial is more powerful than marketing material. Traction metrics are more convincing than projections. A solid lead investor is better than a group of “soft-circled” followers. Don’t fall into the trap of framing your startup Drop the boring bits. Founders often spend a lot of time talking about their product. This makes perfect sense. They spend most of their time building that product and are deeply engaged with the technical details. The problem is that their audience usually doesn’t care that much about the product itself. They have other questions that need answering. What’s the overall market opportunity? Does the team have the right people to win? What’s the unfair advantage? If someone yawns during your pitch, skip to the next plot twist before you lose them forever.While you’re at it, skip the acronyms and buzzwords too. They’re a crutch that can easily alienate your audience. If your story doesn’t make common sense, you’ve got bigger problems.Nothing is more transparent than someone overselling themselves. The only way to guarantee that you’ll sever the connection with your audience is by erecting a facade yourself. Don’t boast. Share what you are already accomplishing. Instead of saying “we’re in conversations with 17 new customers”, say “we closed 2 new customers this month.” Authenticity trumps bluster every time. Anyone you want to work with should know who you really are. Every product you release, every blog post you publish, every pitch you deliver, should be a gift.Founders tend to focus their story on the solution their startup posits and the utopian vision they will realize if successful. But that’s boring. What if Star Wars started after the Rebels had defeated the Empire? Or if the Hunger Games began once Katniss Everdeen had overthrown the Capitol? Or if Harry Potter had already ousted Lord Voldemort before the first book began?Good stories focus on the act of overcoming incredible obstacles. The hurdles are the interesting part, not the medal ceremony. Think about the last time you watched the Olympics.What does this mean for founders? Focus on why the world is broken, not how you’re going to fix it. Articulate all the angles of the problem you’re attacking. How does it impact people emotionally, financially? How does it make their lives miserable? Why is it so hard to deal with? The better you illustrate their pain, the more the tension builds. Your solution is the punch line, don’t steal its thunder.Know your audience. Why are they taking this meeting with you? What drives them? Who inspires them? What would delight them? Customers, talent, press, team, and partners all care about different things. Reflect on what their goals and priorities are. Figure out what the perfect gift would be for them. Make their days.Many early stage founders devote a lot of mindshare to pitching investors, so let’s take them as an example. What motivates early stage investor decision-making? Most people think it’s projected returns, differentiated technology, or a particularly clever idea. Nope.What actually drives investors to write checks? Fear of missing out. Early stage investors spend all day listening to pitches by entrepreneurs. But how do you pick the needle from the haystack? How do you know you’re not passing on the next Google/Facebook/Twitter? That question loiters in the psychological shadows of every coffee meeting. A seed investor’s worst nightmare is missing out on the hottest deals, especially because such a minuscule percentage of deals return almost all the profits.Entrepreneurs can play on those precise heartstrings. How can you make an investor feel like they’re about to miss the boat? Demonstrate all the progress you’ve made and how the train is leaving the station already. Share how much competition you’ve built around the deal, how many other respected investors want in. Illustrate how you will be wildly successful even without their check. The easiest way to raise money is to not need it.What themes should you touch on? Investors measure the success of their portfolios based on Internal Rate of Return or IRR. But IRR also fills in for the traits they look for in startups: Inevitable, Relentless, Resourceful. Founders with these qualities can’t help but find success, even if it’s unplanned. When you’re pitching investors, make sure your story highlights examples of how your startup lives out those themes.Stories are human things. They help us make sense of complex problems. They orient us in the never-ending whirlpool of personal experience. They allow us to communicate and form our own identities. They bring us to tears and inspire us to transcendent action.Entrepreneurs must master storytelling to find success. Good companies are people-driven just as good books are character-driven. And there’s this weird thing about people, they’re story-driven.Eliot is the author of bestselling tech startup thriller I write books and build technology businesses. Author of The Uncommon Series.

Something I’ve Gradually over the last four months of working on my latest venture, it has become apparent that the values I had in mind for it have now become a core part of the startup, and not only within the culture of the small two person team but also expressed by the many users who spread the word of the product.For my startup, I believe having a “point of view” means that you can build a much stronger position in the market, and you can more easily get others on board to help you grow through word of mouth. It can really differentiate you from other products in the market, especially if you are in a market which has “norms” and your values are different from those norms.Another great thing about having a point of view is that it can really help you with your A third reason you might have a point of view is that it can reduce the risk from competitors. It is up to you as a startup to differentiate yourself and create a more compelling offering. The great part is that your offering also includes the message around the product. The point of view you adopt can truly affect whether people will choose you over someone else. If you can express the point of view in a way in which others are convinced to share the same point of view, then competitors not only need a stronger product offering but also need to show users that they have a better point of view.It is easy to read the 37signals quote above and assume that having a point of view is all about forcing your opinions on your users or audience. I’ve found that doing almost the opposite is the best way to get people on your side and spreading your point of view on your behalf. My thinking with this comes from the great I’ve been lucky to have a great co-founder who has not only adopted the point of view I tried to instill in my latest startup but has also taken it further and done some fantastic marketing in a way which has created a community of people who are not only spreading the word of our service but also spreading the point of view we have taken.Do you have a point of view for your startup? I’d love to hear your thoughts on this topic.Founder/CEO  at 

On July 23rd, 2014, I left my job to work full time on my startup, called There is rarely a Nonetheless, I was unreasonably, unstoppably determined to build my own business again, and my wife and family supported me. I had done it once before a few years back, and had a successful outcome. There was nothing stopping me from doing it again.I knew we may go many months without income, so the first step was to reduce our cash burn rate. The lower we could get this, the better. With some very aggressive cost cutting, we were able to get our monthly expenditures down from around $9,000 to $4,500. We cancelled gym memberships. We bought a boat load of spaghetti. I posted my beautiful car on Our biggest cost, by far, was the cost of our breathtakingly beautiful apartment in San Diego, CA. Including base rent and utilities, we were coming in at just around $2,700. We felt guilty that we were spending so much on rent when times were tight, but we certainly didn’t want to pack up and move. We had only relocated here 9 months prior. Plus, we absolutely loved our place!My wife and I had an in-depth conversation about moving back to Monterey, where her parents have a condo that we could stay in for free. (They are extraordinarily generous and insisted.) This could eliminate that $2,700 monthly commitment, and further reduce our burn. This was definitely not the desired solution, but we figured it was the smart thing to do. Sara and I were saddened for the impending change, but optimistic it would be for the better.Then, it dawned on us. Our apartment should not be looked at as a financial So, we surveyed the market and concluded a price point of $299 per night was reasonable. We sat back and crossed our fingers.Shortly after, a request came in for July 23 — 26. We were already going to be in Seattle for July 25 — 27, so this meant free money! Woohoo! We had to lengthen our trip by 2 nights, but it still ended up being a net gain to buy brand new flights, fly in to Seattle earlier than originally planned, and get another couple of nights at the hotel in Seattle. Boom. $773 in our pockets.Just a few days later, we got a request for August 2–8. It would be $2,079 in income. Wow! Nearly 80% of our rent covered by just one week. We headed home from Seattle, relaxed for a few days, and then cleaned up the place and headed up north for a week.While we were staying in Monterey, we got another request for August 13 — 22. This would yield even more cash: $2,308. Because of the quick turnaround time, it didn’t seem fair to trek the baby nearly 1,000 miles round trip down to San Diego and back, so Sara and baby stayed up north while I headed down solo to prep the place for our next guests.As a write this, we are on standby for our next reservation. If we can keep doing this for another few months, it should give us enough runway to allow my startup to generate cash or raise a seed round of funding.There are three things that are making this work:1) My amazing, patient wife.Not only does she manage the listing and communication with the guests, but she coordinates the logistics of moving our family across the state on a semi regular basis. She’s a new mom, and wants nothing more than to nest and have a house to call a home. In the month we’ve been doing this, she’s been gone from her home more than 3 weeks. This is a hard thing for her to do, and I’m incredibly grateful for this.2) We provide an insane amount of value.We take great pride in going above and beyond with our place. I mean, people are paying $300 / night. That’s a lot of dough! We should be providing them with $1,000 worth of value, no exceptions. By default, we generally include a bottle of wine or champagne, and some snacks and treats. We’ve been known to include Starbucks gift cards, popcorn, and chocolate. Even a massage at nearby Massage Envy is on the gift list! We don’t take it lightly that our guests’ bookings are making a massively positive impact on our livelihood, and the least we can do is give them a place worth remembering.3) We have an alternative place to stay for free.We are, of course, displaced during our guests’ stays, and we have to find somewhere to go. If we didn’t have a place to go, we would have to plunk out cash for a hotel, which would seriously erode our profits. So, we head up to our family’s extra condo in Northern California. However, for shorter stays, it doesn’t make sense to head up north, so we’ll find deal on a local hotel. This reduces our net income substantially, but sometimes it’s worth it to have our staycation paid for! For some of my friends that are also renting out on airbnb, they stay with their boyfriend/girlfriend in order to make it work.Since we started, it looks like we’ve actually brought in more money than we spent. Anything to kill that burn rate! Now, if we can figure out how to keep this going. We are even turning up the heat a bit. We’ve transformed our 2nd bedroom from my office to a spare bedroom. This will be more appealing, since people are often looking for the extra space that a hotel can’t provide. Plus, Thank you airbnb, and thank you to our wonderful past and future guests. If I’ve convinced you to give it a try, I wrote the book on

Have you read Back to the point, design. Design is quite a hurdle that can’t be easily jumped. Beginning from the founder’s or cofounders’ perspective which can be really tough. There can be a great idea and a great developer, but without design, not to say UX, that great idea won’t take off. You would be missing that key lego piece that holds everything together. There is a need to have a designer in your startup. Knowing about colors and using an image editor won’t make the cut. Really. I’m color blind and it isn’t helping at all. I haven’t launched because there isn’t someone that can take that job that 1) I trust 2) shares the vision. Well, there’s a coder missing too but I think that finding a capable coder isn’t as hard as finding a designer that is already thinking in the next iteration of your product, even though you haven’t launched just yet.I can’t say that all startups have these 3 pillars (business, code and design) under the hood. What I can say is that an idea without the other 2 will never take off. Perhaps sourcing the coding off-shore works but sourcing a vision is not that simple. The designer has to be trusted or at least has had rapid iterations with a broad knowledge of user-oriented design and user experience best practices. I believe that a nice design and an excellent UX can throw an excellent business idea any time.Design is not just a beautiful logo and hip typography. Design goes far beyond that and it is your job to understand that before going any further with development (if already started). Design can dictate whether developers should just code what was said to them or be part of the whole idea and build with a team of designer’s guidance.Do you feel this way? Do you believe it is really necessary to have design since day 1?Operations Manager 

Lessons learned from one month as a digital nomadThere’s a term that gets thrown around a lot lately that made me cringe a little every time I heard it. “Digital nomad”… Now more than ever it’s easier to just pack your bags and choose a destination to work. But what about startups? What if you’re building a dream together as a team? Members can’t just pack-up and work in a foreign country leaving everything behind, can they?This is exactly what my coworker Because we couldn’t just start a conversation with the person across the desk, it created the need for different processes. Having part of the team on a different continent forced us to use our communication tools to the fullest. Whether it was posting a link in Slack, creating a task in Asana or liking a comment in Quip, our communication flow became more streamlined and transparent. It may seem counterintuitive, but having periods of remote working can open the lines of communication.This is important for any role but it’s People will use your product in different ways and at different times. Having employees spread out among several timezones is a benefit when problems arise. This is particularly helpful if you have an international product and customer service is a big focus of your startup (as it should always be). Admittedly, we only have 2 developers and both of us were in Chiang Mai, so any technical issues on off times could have been difficult to deal with… But luckily nothing major came up during our stay. I still see this as an advantage for most startups out there though. ;)This last point is invaluable both to a startup and the individual. I worked in Korea for 5 years then came back to Toronto in 2012. Since coming back, working on my own startup and then joining Tab, I realized I had never taken a real vacation! I’ve gone away on road trips and weekend getaways, but I really needed to get away for a while. The result was that I was more relaxed, productive and creative than I’ve felt in a long while. My list of ideas and backlog of things to learn grew rapidly over the month and I couldn’t be any happier about it.Of course, keeping everybody synced up would be rough without the right tools. Here’s some of the major ones we use at Tab and how they help us work better.The hub through which all our communication flows. And I do mean everything. I’ve loved Slack from the start and it’s a product that’s gotten better and better since launching. Whether it be for private 1 on 1 chats or a little team debate on product features, it’s the best tool out there for team chat. That’s not even getting into the Keeps everyone informed and on the same track. I follow all the projects that are relevant to me or I’m interested in so that I can wakeup and check my Asana inbox to see what’s going on. New restaurant signups, internal dashboard requests or even fundraising progress. Asana can be more than just a project management tool and bring higher levels of transparency. I found myself ‘liking’ tasks and comments much more frequently than before to let everybody know that I dig what I see!I’ll admit, I wasn’t sold on Quip at first. I thought it had a slick mobile interface with great notification and commenting tools. The problem for me was we already used Dropbox for storage and Google Drive for a variety of docs and spreadsheets. I argued that keeping documents consolidated into one place was simpler and hence better. My thoughts changed however once we were working remotely and the immense value of Quip came to light.While Slack allows us real-time communication and Asana keeps us organized, Quip makes collaboration a breeze. I can see how our sales playbook is evolving, comment on product requirements and ‘like’ what other people have said. Just as in Asana, a ‘like’ provides strong feedback with the click of a button.Yes, remote working is not without its drawbacks.At 5 people, Tab is a small team even for a startup. Our long term product roadmap is constantly changing and needs frequent updating. This is the nature of an early stage startup and requires constant communication with the entire team. Working remotely in different timezones makes it tough to keep everyone on the same page but is not impossible. Steer everyone at all times towards that One of the intangibles. Do anything fun on the weekend? What did you think of Birdman? Where should we go out for lunch? Let’s go out for a drink! A team that eats together stays together afterall. Yes we communicated daily through chat and calls, but it’s not quite the same. It’s why even a 100% remote company like Another hard one to measure but cannot be underestimated. This was highlighted in Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg’s book Downside… not wanting to go back home.Talk with the team and make sure everybody sees the benefits. Set guidelines on how you’ll keep the lines of communication open and clear. Chat with your team often and hop on calls whenever needed because miscommunications can quickly cause rifts and set backs.To know more about remote working, read about In the end, I’d suggest either throwing darts at a map or head on over to iOS Engineer Home of remote workers and digital nomads around the world with tips, interviews, and stories to help you be more productive.

Startups are the future of our economy. They empower people to work on things that they are passionate about. They empower people to innovate, to create the tools and services that we will use tomorrow. Yet, today, it’s still too hard to create and grow a startup in Belgium.It is imperative that we work together with industry partners and policymakers to create and foster a healthy environment for startups to thrive in Belgium for many years to come.With a Belgian Startup Manifesto, we can make our voices heard loud and clear, as the Belgian government prepares to established a ‘Digital Agenda’ action plan for the coming years. Now is our chance to communicate our needs and wishes as a community.The goal is to come up with 5 to 10 concrete propositions that will help Belgium’s policymakers create and support a favorable environment for startup founders, early employees, investors and relevant service providers.We want to invite everyone in the Belgian startup ecosystem to contribute to the Belgian Startup Manifesto, in order to make sure it represents the interests of the entire community as good as possible.Until the end of February, please share your stories and propositions for a more favorable startup environment in Belgium using the hashtag #BEStartupManifesto.Tell us what it was like to create your startup in Belgium, or why did you leave if you ended up creating it elsewhere. Tell us what it is like to be one of the first employees of a startup. Tell us what it was like to be an investor in a startup. And if you have any recommendations on how the ecosystem in Belgium should evolve, please share those as well.Early March, we will review all contributions in a small committee including After the review, we will publish a digest and iterate on the final version of the Belgian Startup Manifesto that we will share with everyone to get as many signatures as possible behind it.Together, we can help shape the future of our economy and create new opportunities for everyone who want to start something.– Karen (P.S: Other European countries have already started working on their own startup manifesto, including the The one stop shop for #Belgian Tech #entrepreneurship.

The Beatles’ debut album, “Please Please Me,” comprising 14 songs recorded in a whirlwind 10-hour session, just celebrated its 50th birthday.That milestone is responsible for a recent bout of nostalgia for the Fab Four, and certainly theirs is a musical legacy that doesn’t look any less powerful the further we’re separated from it by time.I would also argue the Beatles’ narrative arc can be mined for insight not directly related to music — even the startup community, in my opinion, can find some things here to chew on.Here, in fact, are five lessons I think startup founders can take away from the story of one of the greatest rock ‘n’ roll bands of all time.This concept sounds almost asinine, but if it were a piece of knowledge as automatically acquired as you’d expect, there wouldn’t have been, for example, a presentation at SXSW this year on what happens “when bad names happen to good startups.” I realize there’s an art to naming, but if my first question after seeing your venture’s name is how to pronounce it — and then that’s followed by, “Well, what does it mean?” — the focus isn’t on the right thing.The Beatles went through their own list of duds. Johnny and the Moondogs. The Quarry Men. The Silver Beetles. Finally, thankfully, just the Beatles. The “beat” in the name speaks to the whimsy and cheekiness of the mop-topped foursome, as well as to the backbeat being a key element of the early rock sound. The name implies everything the boys are about. A good name is its own explanation.With the possible exception of lead guitarist George Harrison, none of the Beatles was technically proficient or anything close to a virtuoso.Paul McCartney can’t read a single note on a piece of sheet music, even though he’s composed complicated, beautiful music in recent years. John had a little college under his belt, but none of the Beatles had college degrees. And they came from Liverpool, a kind of gritty port town that didn’t tend to produce sons and daughters flecked with the stardust of future celebrity. But because of the music they produced, the whole was greater than the individual parts.So question everything, and don’t buy into someone else’s version of what success looks like. Vision is important, and it’s about doing things like growing your hair longer than everybody else, writing your own songs because you don’t want to play only the same American covers everybody else is playing, shaking your head when you hit a high note, and leaving people with a melody they’re still whistling tomorrow.John and Paul were the songwriting nucleus of the Beatles. Their talents complemented each other’s, and being together forced them to do greater work than they’d have been capable of individually. Same for the rest of the group. They eschewed formula. Pick any album and Ringo’s drumming is liable to sound different from one song to the next, and that’s because he and the band were constantly rifling through the proverbial closet at Abbey Road Studios looking for new things to bang on. When John was feeling nostalgic, he wrote a little song about a park near where he grew up called “Strawberry Fields Forever.” That spurred Paul to write about a neighborhood from his youth in a song called “Penny Lane.” When Paul sang the chorus of “Getting Better” – “It’s getting better all the time” – John immediately follows with, “… it can’t get no worse.” You can’t see around every corner. Find a great partner, and push them as much as they push you.The average fan might not know, but the Beatles themselvesThe Beatles’ misses extended beyond Apple and into the realm of movies. Just because you’re good in front of the camera doesn’t mean you also belong behind the camera, and the third movie starring the Beatles in the 1960s, after “A Hard Day’s Night” and “Help,” was “Magical Mystery Tour.” It was conceived and directed by the Beatles, and it was a cinematic mess and critical flop. There was no plot. It looked like a home movie, it was indulgent, and one of the few things it had going for it — besides great music — was the colorful visuals that would have popped on the screen if the BBC hadn’t broadcasted it in black-and-white. Focus on doing a few things and making them great.The Beatles dissolved at the end of the 60s in the equivalent of a messy, acrimonious divorce. John and his wife, Yoko, decamped to New York, where John pursued an uneven solo career. Paul hid away on his expansive property in the U.K. with his American wife, Linda, who convinced him that, yes, it’s a shame your best friends in the world with whom you reached the pinnacle of success have fallen out with you, and yes, it sucks you no longer have the job you’ve had for more than a decade — but why not “reinvent yourself?”One of Linda’s pregnancies around that time caused her a health scare, and as Paul was waiting for good news he had a vision of angel wings. Linda and the baby turned out ok, so Paul put together a new band and named it Wings. He picked up right where he left off with the Beatles. Of course his new band was in a different league, but its success was not insignificant. They cranked out chart-toppers and put on international tours. There was life after the Beatles, and there’s life after your own failures, endings, and collapses. Reinventing yourself is a matter of remembering what you fell in love with in the first place, and getting back out on the road to do that thing again.Contributor to publications including Fast Company, Forbes, tech blogs and lots more.

One year ago I joined There’s a tonne of stuff I’ve learnt, like how to photoshop your boss into a The very first thing that was apparent to me on day one was the abundance of talent and So what do I do as a Product Designer? Here at Hailo, because we’re a small design team it’s quite simply At first it was a little overwhelming, but there are excellent design processes on the web that I find to be absolutely invaluable especially for fast-paced and small team environment like Hailo. I always aim to incorporate these into my workflow:As designers we can fall into the trap of designing solutions towards the end of the product development cycle “We need a new menu for this feature”. At Hailo we usually start with “Let’s understand more about x” which then leads to discovery type questions “Why do you use this?”. Often, we think we discover a problem in the product then dive into solutions, but constantly asking yourself Why are you even bothering to work on this? What problem are you solving? I’ve been forcing myself to get into the habit of always asking these questions. To achieve this, I write down everything I can before starting any design so I can begin to frame the problem better and communicate it with others.That really stuck with me and is especially true at Hailo. One of the most important processes we have is Coming from a background where I hadn’t done much usability studies or customer interviews, and then having it on almost every piece of work became a revelation. No longer are your designs pixels that only you and your colleagues see. We prototype and invite our customers or drivers to There’s a real skill in interviewing and probing customers with past experiences and memories to uncover insights. I’ve learnt many interview skills, but my favourite one is:We believe conducting field research is a great way to get an even better understanding of our customers and drivers behaviours, influences and motivations.Despite a small team, investing in research provided a solid foundation for my designs and as a product designer, I can’t live without it. After all, learn early and learn often.SaffProduct Designer

I do lots of hand drawings and I can whip up fun logos, icons or layout an entire app using Sketch, its really powerful (good bye Adobe PS)If you need to find a good designer, check out For my design process I use a white board in the garage (my office), pens, paper then I go right into pixels to polish the design. From this point if any motion needs to be thought out, depending on time I will A) Animate my designs in Adobe Animate, or B) find examples of ones we like and can push further in code. Check Try Squarespace.com, they have a landing page template you can customize, and integrate mailchimp (one click), analytics, add custom domain..etc for $8/mth.Free Art, Backgrounds..ect You can also try I am sure their are tons of other options but don’t waste too much time on this step, you just need a professional looking website for people to signup for beta on.You can set up Google Analytics or if you’re mobile only you can set up Set up your free Get a terms and conditions page to protect your startup Try I highly recommend checking this Medium post by @rrhover Become a Send out your Mailchimp email blast to all your signups, this will drive them to your product.

Two weeks ago, at Boost VC, we decided to go “Full Bitcoin” and a lot of applications are funneling in the doors! This prompted a lot of different people to ask what types of Bitcoin companies we are looking for. The answer to this falls into four buckets:Bitcoin has been an awesome “Toy” for 5 years and during that time, we have the technology stretched to its limits. Bitcoin is overly complicated, it is hard to use, and the security can use an update. These problems in bitcoin are opportunities for companies in the space to solve. This is where the “Repair Mode” bucket falls into place: We want to back any companies that are fixing the holes in the technology of Bitcoin. Some good examples of this are BlockCypher and HashRabbit, bother companies who have already been through Boost. BlockCypher, makes it easy to plug and play and build a Bitcoin company, this helps the usability. HashRabbit builds the software for the bitcoin miners, thus helping the security of the software in bitcoin. There are a lot of opportunities in this category:On the second Bucket, we are looking for companies that are solving a true need in the world. A lot of people are discussing the Bitcoin end game, but in order to get to the “World Domination” end game, Bitcoin needs a use case. When thinking about what use cases will add more value than the current monetary system, I think about what Bitcoin does better that cash, and the answers are:These 3 things, Bitcoin does better than cash TODAY. It makes it cheaper do do cross-boarder transactions, it makes it possible to do micro-transactions without any middle man taking a cut, and in most countries, they do not have the stability that the United States has in our banking system, and Bitcoin is a leapfrogging technology for those countries as a store of value.Boost has seen a trend moving in the direction of the block chain. A lot of investors have begun to say, “I’m much more interested in the block chain than bitcoin”, however they are all under the same bracket in our book. The incentives of the miners in the bitcoin ecosystem is dependent on bitcoin, but as long as the incentives work, the block chain is by far the most powerful part of the technology. We have begun to see some incredible ideas pop up in the block chain direction.We are also interested in anything that we have yet to think of. Be creative, find real problems and solve them. We are really excited about supporting the next generation of bitcoin companies! Running Stories and teachings from the Boost VC team.

I was experimenting with growing a startup.Time was scarce and I cared about using it I knew I built something useful. It was simply a matter of connecting with the I wanted to hire some people to help with sales… but I didn’t want to read through wordy resumes.I asked people to If they were great questions, I answered, and then awaited for another set of 10.If not, I politely thanked the person for taking time to ask questions.Ok, I confess… there was another piece of the story I left out.I didn’t say how to contact me or the name of the startup.The results? The conversion ratio between who saw the ad and how many questions I received was about 100 to 1. Out of every 100 people who saw the ad, 1 person responded.The questions I received were all over the map. Usually it was a mix of personal questions and startup-related questions.5 reasons:Simple: And time for a startup is the most valuable asset.I could share the position with friends and through social networks, too, to help with quality.And this strategy helps me find people who are resourceful, creative, and ok with a new way of doing things… all things that I value in my team culture.Here’s the process I used:LinkedIn should be filled. I should be able to find everything I need very easily online.If someone isn’t up-to-par on social, they’re probably not a good match for a tech startup.If someone has everything hidden due to privacy settings, then they’re probably not a good match for a startup where we need to be Startups are a unique breed.They are a game of momentum.Teams need to move quick.People need to be ok with making mistakes for the sake of Time matters because startups have a limited runway.They are not stable entities. They are not proven.Leaders are limited by their level of awareness.Because of this, everything should be seen as an opportunity to raise your awareness.Being an effective CEO is about mastering your psychology.What you cannot see in yourself you cannot accurately see in others.It’s about reducing friction and captivating people to help you execute on your vision.Do you value creative execution in your startup?

The title of “BizOps teams are generally an internal-facing group and broadly aim to create more value for the company and to improve the profitability of the business. Tech startups are already familiar with the role of Product Managers — people who drive product development by setting feature priorities and collaborating with a team of engineers and designers to ship these features. By the same token, shouldn’t other areas of your business have designated “managers” as well?BizOps teams have a “get shit done” mentality and are often tasked with translating business goals (strategy) into tactical operations (execution). For example:While BizOps responsibilities are similar across companies, BizOps teams can be structured in different ways. For some, the BizOps team is like Seal Team 6 — internal consultants deployed for specific and shorter-term projects. Because they act as a neutral third party, BizOps teams in this structure don’t interact closely with other business units regularly.More commonly, BizOps teams are flat structures that are horizontally tied to other functional groups, such as:For early-stage startups, BizOps allows for a flexible, dynamic, scrappy team to work on a multitude of different types of business problems that otherwise may not fall anywhere else in the company (eg. starting a new office, doing sales hiring, owning the company financial model, etc.) As the company grows, BizOps can prioritize key issues (e.g., growth, monetization) and help balance strategy with execution. And for larger and more mature startups, BizOps provides a cross-functional layer of communication, structure, and organization across the greater company.Depending on the stage of your startup, here are examples of a few inflection points where a BizOps team may make sense:There are many approaches to BizOps, and it’s really up to founders and CEOs to decide how to utilize BizOps most effectively for their company.

A few months ago I came home from work exhausted and mentally drained.As a CEO of a After I walked into the kitchen, my wife So, I shut up.After I got quiet, she gave me a funny grin.The kind of grin she uses whenever she makes an expensive purchase or has news that she knows might get me worked up.I gave her a funny, questioning look and raised my eyebrows — “What?” I asked.“Soooooo….” she began, as she reached for the pregnancy test…. “I’m pregnant!” as she shot me a probing smile.I can’t exactly remember how I reacted, but it was something along the lines of excitement, anxiety, fear, joy, worry, relief and surprise all rolled into one.I wasn’t ready for that particular news. I don’t think you can be.At that moment, I felt a feeling rush across me in a giant wave.It was a feeling of responsibility.It was the feeling of I was 34 years old, and my time as a grown child had run out.I was now having a child.My Inner Voice (we’ll just call him And I knew Hugo was right.Hugo knew this moment was coming and had been nervous about it.Hugo continued: Again, I knew Hugo was right.Hugo added: I didn’t know how this change would happen, but I knew I needed to change.So, I gave my wife a big smile, a kiss and a hug, and tried to absorb the news.But deep down, I knew I had lots to process.As head of a startup that had raised $8.8 million dollars from investors, I already had an enormous amount of responsibility on my plate.Now I would soon have a child added to the long list of ‘things I’m responsible for.’Hugo assured me: Still, I was scared shitless.I was scared I’d be a bad father.I was scared that I’d let down my wife.I was scared that I wouldn’t be simultaneously a good father AND a good CEO.And you know what? It’s a few months later, and But I’m an entrepreneur, and fear of failure is something I’m very accustomed to.Fear of failure drives me to do what I do every single day.So, in attempt to work through all my fears, doubts and uncertainty, I’ve decided to simply write about my feelings.Writing is therapeutic for me.So the forthcoming collection of posts will reflect my attempt to come to terms with starting up a human life while balancing my responsibilities as a startup CEO.I hope you enjoy.CEO  Co-Founder of On starting up another human life while running a startup company. 

Entrepreneurs dream of running their own online businesses for weeks, months and sometimes Once you’ve secured your first handful of customers, it’s tempting to sit back and depend on them to spread the word—watch the users flood in, but if only it was that simple. There’s a whole iterative process to building a tribe around your product in order to keep the ship above water. Sure, if your product really solves a problem users may attract users, but in such early stages it’s essential to think about the Invest time and effort into working out these 5 and your startup marketing efforts will be a breeze.If you don’t know your target audience and understand their needs, all your marketing and business efforts are subject to fail.Define who your ideal customer is. What do they do for a living? How do they spend their free time? What type of sites would they be found searching through? What tone of voice do they use? The more you know about your ideal customer the better geared up you’ll be when working out how to attract them. It’s hard work learning about the behaviours of people but by drawing up personas you’ll set off on the right track.Creating personas should be priority on your list from the word go (that’s ‘go’ Essential for startup teams.Marketing legend We built a handy little tool called Your purpose in business is the Businesses with a higher purpose have a real resilience to them. They have a reason for being that sets them apart from money-hungry corporations with a hollow existence that no one really cares about. To begin building a solid community around your business, you’ve got to learn what makes people tick. Having a clear purpose engages your audience in a more emotive way (something that corporates struggle to do, so set yourself apart) and if you have their support, they’ll rally around your cause spreading the word far and wide, becoming a super-fan before you’ve even launched ;)One example of this is through our work at The Happy Startup School. We’re not just passionate about But we’re not alone. There’s a whole movement of purpose driven companies paving the path for the future of business (Patagonia, Buffer, Nixon McInnes, Propellernet, Delivering Happiness, Innocent, Moo etc.)Take Zappos for instance, they’re an international online store who sell shoes. Their purpose isn’t to sell shoes. It’s to make people happy.Zappos have millions of super-fans across the world that are loyal to their brand for the incredible customer service they’re guaranteed on every purchase, and when postal problems do arise, customers speaking to such happy employees has a knock on effect. Their purpose as a business, to make people happy, has been the driving force for the success of their outreach.Don’t get left behind. Purpose-driven companies are the future. Communicate your reason for being from day 1.As a lone rider entrepreneur, juggling the whole parade of social media accounts that come with brand building, alongside the mountain of other things on your to-do list probably falls as low priority. But it’s just as important to start engaging with customers through social channels and at events in your industry, as it is to build a great product.I don’t think it’s ever too early to kick off the social media bandwagon for your startup, when you could use social media as a channel for I loved one of our client’s approaches, I recently read the noted Surely in the early stages of building a community around your business, it’s a lot like asking people to make friends with your brand? No?So, as if you were meeting people and making friends face-to-face, Carnegie advises to:It’s important to make time for everyone in your industry on social media. Reply to every tweet you receive. Follow and chat to key people in your field. Share great content (either your own posts or stuff that’s already out there) and if you’re just starting out, don’t let low levels of interaction get you down. Look for discussions you can join in on and get excited to start building an online community in the industry you’re passionate about.It’s important to get a sound-footing into social channels and make connections at events as early as possible so you can later make strategic partnerships for a killer marketing plan.This next point is closely linked with defining your vision and purpose for your business. Making people feel like they are part of change generally precedes working out what that change is; the reason your startup exists.Ask yourself this, what change do you want to see in the world? How can your business work towards this and make an impact?I recently joined the Spook folks at one of the most inspiring events I’ve ever attended. A conference called MeaningConf based here in Brighton, a whole day of speakers all with the common goal to re-design business for the 21st century. Rick Falkvinge, founder of the Swedish Pirate Party was the first speaker of the day sharing the story of how one man with an idea for change became the fastest growing political party with just €50,000.Rick shared how he created a massive community on a shoestring budget, by adopting a ‘swarm’ strategy — where thousands of people come together to make one specific change (he elaborates in his book Rick taught us that people This means placing customers at the heart of every process in business. People love sites that are a joy to use, they prefer visiting blogs that are a joy to read. It’s design that determines whether a visitor stays or leaves a site you’ve directed them to. It’s never been more important for marketeers and startups to take a people-centred approach to building products and writing/designing for emotion.If you invest in great design right from the start, you’ll be ahead of so many other entrepreneurs who put technology before their customers. Well designed products and services can bring a huge competitive advantage to business, giving a leg up to all your marketing efforts before you’re full steam ahead. I strongly urge you to read a recent article by Laurence (founder and designer at Chief Happiness Officer 

Storytelling has emerged as one of the biggest business marketing trends of 2015. The word is so ubiquitous, it’s in danger of being relegated to the status of business buzzword (right up there with synergy and disrupt).But the art of storytelling is anything but a trend. It’s as old as, well… history. Stories are our way of finding common ground, offering solutions to problems, or gaining a deeper understanding of the world.To explain why compelling stories matter so much — to businesses, as well as society at large — the Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center sat down with Michael Margolis, Founder and CEO of Story is the most basic unit of communication and how we find what we share in common with each other. I need to know your story before I can trust you with mine. These days, there are so many demands for our attention 24–7. Everyone’s saying, “Look at me! Be a part of what I’m doing.” We’re all trying to figure out, “Do I belong in that story? Is this relevant to me?“It’s actually very simple. The question is, “Do you really give a sh@% about this, or are you just trying to sell me something?” That’s the ultimate question in everybody’s mind when they’re presented with a message. We ask ourselves, “Do you care about my world and making it better, or are you just treating me like a sales funnel of aggregate data?”When you’re learning how to tell a better business story, presence trumps performance. It’s not about finding those perfect words that can help you dominate the marketplace. It’s about being confident in and connected to what you do, why it matters, and why it’s a gift that makes a real difference in people’s lives. There’s nothing wrong with selling — we’re all selling something. But how much do you really believe in what you’re offering? This reveals some part of your own humanity.I’m not into a formulaic 1–2–3, perfect fill-in-the-blank MadLib type story. People are disillusioned and turned off by that. When you’re an entrepreneur or innovator, the nature of what you’re doing is disruptive. It challenges people’s current understanding of the world — it’s a confrontational story. So how do you tell and frame your story in a way that doesn’t put people on the defensive? We teach a specific storytelling structure and approach to addresses just that.They’re not connecting. And usually when we’re not connecting with others, we’re not connecting with ourselves.We bring the wisdom of The Lean Startup into our storytelling methodology. Because the question is, “How do you bring integrity to the process of speculation?” By definition, as an entrepreneur, you’re making something out of nothing. It’s a speculative act — you’re still laying down the train tracks. How do you establish context and create enough reality so that people are willing to go on your journey with you? So they can deal with the uncertainty of being part of a story that’s still a work in progress?That’s the fine balance that every entrepreneur has to bring to any audience. If you go too far into “make-believe,” you lose people. And if you go too far into over-rationalization, everybody’s bored to death.One place to start is the origin story. Ask yourself: Where did this idea come from? Why are you doing this beyond your own self-interest? How is what you’re doing now connected to or informed by anything you’ve done before? What’s going to convey to people that you have natural authority, the right to tell this story, even though you’re doing something that’s never been done before?You need to know this not just for your audience, but also for yourself. If you don’t believe in your story, how can you expect somebody else to? When we hear someone with a sense of conviction, that’s the undeniable story — you believe in that person. They have the “it” factor. It’s in their bones. Of course, we all have a story in us.Looking to become a better communicator and business storyteller?

When what you’re doing is validated by new signups, social endorsement, enthusiasm, press and massive interest, it’s incredible. You begin to truly believe what you’ve been telling yourself — that this is going to be a wild success. It’s almost surreal when it’s happening. You feel unstoppable to some degree.You get unsolicited emails from people you’ve never met, just to say how great your product is. You get people offering their talents to you at no cost, just so they can be involved. Investors start to cold contact you (which is a contradiction to the warm intro they normally require). Press begins to snowball, and one piece leads to another.You become wanted and desired. You get requested to speak at venues, your feedback is valued. Your network size increases exponentially.It’s all overwhelming and extremely exciting.Then there’s the other side of the coin.Traction is addicting, but not necessarily in a good way. Press attention is like crack (so I’d imagine). The high is short-lived and as soon as it wears off you want more. You start to fabricate and lie, just to get it.With more users comes more responsibility. Shit gets real so-to-speak. You begin to feel the pressure of needing to execute flawlessly in order to not disappoint a soul. You spend an immense amount of time communicating with your advocates, which takes your focus off of executing flawlessly.The haterade cooler gets dumped over your head. This stings at first, but eventually you begin to see how an opposing opinion benefits you. In the beginning, it takes every ounce of you not to fall into the trap of tearing these fools apart. As it continues, your skin starts to thicken and it becomes somewhat of an expected norm. However, no matter how thick of a shell you have, it always hurts.You begin to feel extremely nervous about missing a window. You don’t know where that window is or how long it will be there, but you know it exists. You want to capitalize with the perfect revenue approach and capture as much of it while the getting is good. Every day that goes by without revenue is a missed opportunity. The stress mounts and nothing you do is fast enough.You start to over-analyze every word you speak and every decision you make. The stakes seem too high to make any stupid errors. When you do make a mistake, it feels devastating.Eventually, the excitement fades and reality sets in. You’re not immortal and people have short attention spans. You wish the honeymoon would continue, but that’s not how the startup world works. You realize that you need to build a sustainable business, not a hype machine.Post originally appeared in Co-founder/CEO - Wahooly. Im into cool ideas. AngelPad Alum.

Startup Istanbul ‘un benim için iki büyük anlamı vardı, birincisi startups.watch olarak stand açtık. İkincisi ise o kadar yazılarını okuduğumuz Steve Blank’i canlı olarak gördük.Bir diğer değindiği konu girişimlerin bir din gibi olduğu idi. Etrafınıza size inanan müritler topluyorsunuz ve onlarla beraber bir yolda ilerliyorsunuz. Yoksa kimse girişimcilerin neden 7x24 çalıştığını açıklayamaz.Son olarak da devletin görevinin “make it easy to start a business” olduğunu söylemesiydi. Bunu söylerken kendi vatandaşlarınız için değil, tüm civar ülkeler için de bunu yapın dedi. Yani “bir İran’lı, Suriye’li, Pakistan’lı da gelsin Türkiye’de iş kursun” dedi. Buna kesinlikle katılıyorum. Önemli olan girişimcinin hangi ülkeden olduğu değil, nerede istihdam yarattığı ve nerede vergi ödediği :) Devletin biraz para vermesini sakıncalı bulmuyorum gerçi, dozajı iyi ayarlamak önemli. Çok verirse uyuşturucu etkisi yapabilir. Bunu şuna benzetebiliriz. Türkiye’de 2–3 yaşında bir çocuk yere düştüğünde ebeveynlerin çoğu hemen elinden tutar, kaldırır, çoğu Kuzey Avrupa ülkesinde ise çocuğun kendi kendine kalkması beklenir (en azından Finlandiya ve Almanya’da bu şekilde bir kaç örnek gördüm). Bu biraz da hayatın her noktasında “biraz destekten ne çıkar” diyen bir millet olmamızla alakalı sanırım. Hafif destek iyidir :)“Collectively smarter” diye bir not almışım ama şimdi neyi kastettiğini hatırlayamadım. Hatırlayan varsa buraya not düşebilir.Bir tek eleştirim marka konusunda. Konumlandırma eksiği olduğunu düşünüyorum. eTohum, Startup Istanbul, Startup Turkey marka olarak birbirini tamamlamıyor. Ben olsam “Startup Istanbul by eTohum” gibi yapardım ve eTohum’u marka olarak parlatırdım.Genel olarak Startup Istanbul’a 100 üzerinden 95 verdim diyebilirim (100 vermeyim ki seneye daha iyisini yapmaya çalışsınlar :)Tüm ekibe tebrikler, MENA bölgesinin bence çekim merkezi oldular. Steve Blank ile de çıtayı biraz daha yükselttiler. Seneye kim gelir bilmiyorum ama en az Steve Blank gibi biri gelir diye tahmin ediyorum, çünkü beklenti yükseldi artık :)Ben yine de Neyse çok yazdım, siz de buraya kadar okuduysanız çok okudunuz, hadi işinizin başına!Co-Founder of dakick.com (acquired by Turkcell) ; Author of “Dijital Girişimcilik Rehberi”  “Silikon Vadisi ve Girişimcilik”  “Dijital Girişimcilik 101”

Danielle Morrill is kicking ass. At 29 years old, she has built one company, dismantled it and built one more. She tweets on the daily with Marc Andreessen and Dave McClure. With a unique ear for social commentary, she is an expert at engaging with the startup community on a personal level. How did she do it?GROWTH MARKETING.The following are some insights taken from her success:Danielle has lambasted start ups that believe the engineering team is more important than anyone else.In response to a tweet that originated with Steve Blank — “Why are sales and marketing invited to the launch party? It’s engineering who should be celebrating,” — Danielle argued that this mindset is particularly dangerous for early stage companies.In a post titled When she was first invited to join Twilio, one of the first things she told the recruiter was that she would only become their marketing director if the department was never treated as less than engineering.You have to treat the team as a cohesive whole.It has to be their startup rather than just a company they work for.In a post titled To get your product in front of as many potential customers as possible, you need to do something new. Anything that Twilio, Referly and Mattermark used to gain traction has already been done and commoditised. Growth Hackers often use tried and true tactics (if they work,why wouldn’t you?). But trying new things and finding an unfair advantage is what separates the good hackers from the great ones.

Régulièrement, un nouvel ami qui veut monter sa boite m’appelle pour avoir « quelques conseils ».Non pas que je sois le roi de l’entrepreneuriat, mais je suis passé par une bonne partie des étapes de ce parcours du combattant et j’ai donc pu goûter aux délices suivants : cours d’entrepreneuriats en école de commerce, apprentissage du code, création d’une startup, passage en incubateur, levée de fonds auprès de business angels, subvention publique, CIR, pivot, recrutement de dev, travail avec des agences, des freelances, des stagiaires, contrôle fiscal…Les joies de l’entrepreneuriat quoi ☺Puisque les milliards d’articles qui existent déjà sur le sujet ne semblent pas empêcher mes amis de me poser des questions et qu’une bonne partie des conseils que je peux donner se recoupent, autant les lister une bonne fois pour toute.Si vous avez des remarques / questions supplémentaires qui vous viennent en tête, n’hésitez pas !Et l’un des moyens de corriger ce biais, au moins partiellement, c’est de mieux Le but n’est pas de devenir un “maître” de l’entrepreneuriat, au contraire.

Your company is in a good place. People love what you’re building; you’ve got an active customer base that’s helping spread the word. You’re ready to dominate and you’ve got the Series A cash to do it. In startup-speak, you’ve demonstrated product market fit, viral coefficients are greater than one, and now you’re ready to launch new markets on your path to disrupt the industry. Go big, but go smart.In this three-part series on Going Global, I’ll cover:2. 3. Part I starts now.Think of each city where you don’t yet operate as an untapped revenue source full of eager people who need your product. There’s also what I refer to as To determine the upsides and risks, here’s what you need to consider:Ready to dig in? Let’s go!No doubt market size matters. In urban areas there’s high population density and a concentration of media, so word travels quicker and often further. This provides a fertile launch bed for startups looking to grow their ranks and gain brand awareness.For these reasons, many companies looking to expand opt for top tier metros like NYC, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. The downside is that there’s so much noise in these cities that even your best efforts can seem like a drop in the bucket.For companies that are already established in one of these areas, it can be beneficial to go to underserved areas first, rather than compete for mind share in the big three. I’ve found that cities such as Seattle, Austin, and Miami provide substantial opportunity and serve as good testing grounds. It’s also often easier to develop relationships with press and potential partners, making it easier to dominate the market.Establish if there’s a sufficient target customer base using free tools on the web. Wolfram Alpha is an excellent resource for high-level Ramping new cities is only sustainable with support from the local community. For this reason, it’s most important look to your users; markets with the highest organic growth show that there’s a culture fit and that you’re speaking to a real need. Don’t just take it from me! This was the advice Paul Graham gave the Airbnb founders during our “trough of sorrow” phase.If there’s not significant presence in any one area, take advantage of personal networks in cities which you’ve previously lived. Remember how your first evangelists were you and your team’s friends and family? Same principle applies to new markets: get those who already love to your support you. Leveraging these networks can provide a strong initial user base.Facebook Open Graph and your LinkedIn contacts are a great place to start. Introduce your company and ask if there’s anyone in the space with whom they’d recommend speaking. Remember to be respectful of your contact’s time and relationships; include a ⌘C ⌘V description of your project and your reason for wanting to connect.Zero in on who’s using your product and find out if there’s a similar segment in the prospective market. If you’ve conducted a persona study you’ve got a head start. Here we want to answer more location-specific questions.If you don’t yet have sophisticated data, slice and dice with Facebook Open Graph:Look for patterns and take note of the following: Are members/users/customers (mucs) within a certain demographic? Are they of the same sociographic? Your initial target segment in new markets should be of this ilk. Where do they go online and offline for information? Do they live in urban or rural areas? What are their favorite pastimes? There’s a good chance you’ll find future mucs in these places.For many businesses, expanding your territory will mean capturing that of others. Some companies dial up scare tactics and go where the competition is, while others establish presence in the industry center to build awareness.Time for a targeted S.W.O.T. analysis. How is your company different? Scratch that! Not just different. How is your company going to be the best?! What additional tremendous value can you bring to your mucs? This is the way you will win.No users and starting out fresh? It’s even more important to research the incumbents. Which companies have similar offerings to yours? How does the pricing compare? What channels are they using for awareness and acquisition? Pour over their marketing materials and note their branding and the positioning of their value proposition. Identify what they’re doing right and what could be improved upon.Surely laws are in place to protect and preserve the safety, rights, and liberties of the people. But many are archaic, reflecting – as Cindy Gallop would say, “the old world order”– and don’t always find purchase in our era of rapidly evolving tech.States have varying regulations for many industries including food, transportation, and hospitality. Opening up shop and transacting in different states may require licensing and have tax implications.Do your homework online, then sync with legal to fill in any gaps before expanding to the new territory. If legislation affects your industry at large, it may be advisable to create a consortium to address the issues with local lawmakers.In the early days of Airbnb we were singularly focused on building a product that our users loved. At our scale back then, regulatory wrist slaps seemed like a far distant future. Fast forward three years, the company is booking more nights than Hilton worldwide, and heck, do the hotel industry lobbyists have something to say!Ah, but what’s better than lobbying? Passionate users taking up the charge. This past July, Airbnb, Lyft, TaskRabbit and several other collaborative consumption companies joined Peers.org.

The Lean Startup was first published in 2011 and has since become a bible for start-up entrepreneurs around the world. Recently I’ve read a good number of articles that question The Lean Startup. But criticizing the lean start-up approach is misled. Why? Because that is all it is, an approach, albeit a very good one.The Lean Startup is not a prescribed formula that guarantees business success. Sadly, “management is complicated”, something that the book’s author, Eric Ries, makes very clear To criticise the lean start-up as an approach is to misinterpret it. At the root of the problem is the impression that it provides a rigid methodology for achieving start-up success. But Eric Ries makes it very clear that “those who look to adopt the lean start-up as a defined set of steps or tactics will Let me put that into context. One article I read suggests that The Lean Startup provides an excuse for taking unfinished products to market too quickly. I don’t think so. Turn to page 95 and read what Eric Ries says: “deciding how complex an MVP [Minimum Viable Product] needs to be cannot be done formulaically. It requires judgement”. With all due respect, if you have found yourself in a position where you have decided to take an inferior product to market, then blame your own business judgement not a book.Business methodologies are not a new phenomenon and as a former management consultant I can attest to having worked with more than I can care to remember. But I have never seen any one methodology applied to a business situation without resort to at least some adaptation or even the merging of several methodologies together. Financial Times management columnist I’ll conclude with another quote from Eric Ries, taken directly from his book, in which he emphasizes the need to avoid a prescriptive approach: “because of the scientific methodology that underlies the lean start-up, there is often a misconception that it offers a rigid clinical formula… This is not true. There is no way to remove the human element — vision, intuition, judgement — from the practice of entrepreneurship, nor would that be desirable”.The Lean Startup provides a range of excellent tools, techniques and processes to help you find your solution but ultimately it is up to you. So what is wrong with The Lean Startup? Absolutely nothing, just use it wisely.CEO Coach and Venture Strategist

You don’t always have 10 minutes to pitch your startup to new investors or potential clients and customers. But you should be prepared for any and every opportunity to sell your startup to the people who can help you take it to the next level. Even if that opportunity is only 30 seconds long. Easier said than done, sure, but not impossible. Here’s your formula for a bulletproof elevator pitch:The largest and most active angel group in the Midwest, #1 Midwest Angel Investment Group

Silicon Valley’s top startup program, Y Combinator, graduated its first class of non-profit startups yesterday.As the genre defining startup accelerator, this is a pretty big deal. YC is the same institution that brought us household names like Airbnb, Dropbox, Reddit and many more.Traditionally they’ve been very focused on finding the next billion dollar company—and they’ve been quite good at that. So, what will it look like when they start working with non-profits? Well, now we have a few answers.5 of the 6 are creating (mostly software) products—and the one outlier is helping kids learn to create software products. This isn’t surprising. The product focus means these non-profits will be able to benefit from YC’s core expertise of helping young software companies grow quickly.These organizations all share super inspiring missions. But, it’s also important to note how non-controversial they all are. Who could be against creating an HIV vaccine?Closely related is that none of them have structural approaches towards making the world a better place (i.e. advocating for schools to start teaching software dev in the classroom). Instead, they all focus on providing services. In other words, the belief that non-profits should play an important role in challenging or changing existing institutions and laws doesn’t seem to fit into YC’s selection criteria.Interestingly, most of these startups seem to depend on donations for income. I haven’t seen any their business models, but tellingly 5 of the 6 had a large donate button on their homepage. I can easily imagine that most could (and perhaps are already planning to) transition to a revenue generating approach, but it doesn’t appear to be where they’re starting from.This is noteworthy because a big trend in the broader non-profit tech community is focusing on product based revenue generation from the get-go—so you’re not as dependent on the whims of major donors or subject to the long timelines and reporting requirements of major foundations.I suspect that as the YC mentors gain more experience in watching their startups go through the process of raising major donations, you’ll see more of these non-profits launching with baked in revenue generation models.Y Combinator casts a long shadow in the tech world. So, bringing non-profits into the mix has the potential to create some really interesting change outside of the program itself.Despite it’s massive accumulation of wealth, the YC has a huge role in setting cultural norms in SV, and beyond. It’s been great to see YC founder Paul Graham talk up Watsi (the first YC backed non-profit, which he sits on the board of) and YC partner Paul Bucheit offer This has the potential to not only unlock a lot more money for non-profits, but also to create some really valuable mentors and connectors.Silicon Valley is filled with really well intention people who want to change the world and make it a better place. Unfortunately, two other trends often get in the way:Simply by accepting ambitious, world changing, non-profits into it’s program, YC is showing us all what’s possible and helping to blow up both of these narrow minded trends.So, here’s to hoping this is the beginning of a new wave of big-thinking, do-gooder, world-changing startups that are solely focused on impact, not tax status.Rey Faustino, founder at One Degree, reached out to me with a few of his thoughts on this piece. At his suggestion, I’ve included his email below.

Absolutely, but I’m no longer fascinated by the entrepreneur thing. If everyone’s an entrepreneur, where are the employees? I stopped organising hackathons a couple of years ago because we hit peak entrepreneurship. Every We prefer to do collaborative hackathons where people are meant to help each other do something fun and learn in the process, but the space has been ruined by all the hackathons that are for hiring.Secret was getting popular at that time. It always helps to go where the crowd is going, but I also thought Secret had potential. Secret blew it.Secret was on the cusp of something interesting pointing in the Wikileaks direction — a watchdog environment of sorts — but that approach wasn’t commercially viable, so they pivoted into something else that had no life at all. Also because Secret was based on your existing social graph, you weren’t getting trolled by complete strangers, just people you actually knew who didn’t dare tell you in person. Secret was a fantastic way of getting confidential feedback that you actually needed to hear.I prefer the academic viewpoint. Ronald Coase won a Nobel prize for explaining how it works about half a century ago. Coase’s Theory of the Firm examined why people bother to be employees when everyone could be freelancers, and he explained transaction costs in negotiating each assignment vs just taking a salary, and that eventually led to a Nobel prize.It’s like the telco business. At Re 1 per minute or less, you can bet they are barely making any money, but there’s so much volume in it that it looks huge. HasGeek loses about five lakhs every year overall. We sold a house to finance it, so basically that’s what’s leaking out a year at a time. People see the top line instead of the bottomline and assume we’re minting money.About giving up: hope comes from watching the top line, not the bottom line, so it looks healthy right now. The belief is that if we make this space efficient, we’ll make profit.My inbox is full of people begging to give us money for posting on Hasjob. We only started tracking stats carefully on Hasjob this January. After looking at the stats, I was initially very depressed. We had been logging for a couple of years, but never looked at it. I ran a query to see how many days across a month a user was active on. The average: This is the query that generated it:So if you look at it, 50% of users are present on one day and never come back. Because it’s 50%, a simple average will tell me the answer is one, i.e, nobody ever comes back, which is plainly wrong. Whoever that dude is at the 100th percentile is super dedicated (it’s not me, I checked). For all I know, it’s an agent for some other job board who is scraping for leads. I wrote this graphing code in January when we were having a bad traffic dip. I don’t know why, maybe people come back relaxed after holidays and decide they don’t want to look for a new job after all. Since Jan we started working actively on the site. No marketing, just new features and you can see the faint background bars which are the total number of active users that month. Feb and March have clear growth. If you’re thinking “just 4000 users?”, this is a website we built as a hobby project and have barely ever paid attention to.We try hard to automate everything. We have no extra hands to do one-off connections and other such activities, so we will do leadgen when we can make it a self service.If you ask me, we have barely a tenth of the events this ecosystem is capable of supporting. When you have too few events to choose from, every event tries to address as wide a range of people as possible, and when you have breadth you can’t have depth, so no event has really deep content that can only be understood by people who are really deep into the subject. Every event is just general knowledge gyan. We need a lot more competition between events to force people to focus.I help review the talks for HasGeek events, so I see this as a particular problem with most speakers. When speakers don’t know the audience, they start with a basic intro to the subject and then go deeper, and when delivering, they usually run out of time before they get to the core content. My general advice is to dump the first 50% of their slides and figure out how to start from the second half. Not everyone takes it well.The reason we keep getting such intro level content submitted is because if there aren’t enough events to choose from, every event has a large beginner-level audience who will be lost if you don’t start with an intro. For example, I just reviewed a talk about how some firm does design work for a client, detailing the entire process of understanding what the client wants and making sure they don’t deliver irrelevant results. The first 10 slides were all about how the industry is full of bad results and everyone misunderstands each other. I told them to dump those 10 slides. Everyone knows what the industry’s problems are, we’re interested in the solutions.So the challenge for event organiser is: can you dare to do an event that excludes beginners? (If there’s competition, there’s no choice but to focus. If not, you’ll be tempted to expand scope.)A 2-track event costs 2x, so either there’s 2x the audience or everyone pays 2x. That’s not easy.I know most of the other event organisers in india and we’re generally on good terms. Ajey Gore from Rubyconf is also on the editorial panel for Rootconf and Aravind Krishnaswamy ran editorial for Droidcon for three years before retiring and taking up PyCon. So there’s a fair bit of people moving around. People who really organise events understand how tough it is, and how much collaboration is required. People who sit on the sidelines tend to imagine there’s a lot of drama and rivalry (which, to be honest, exists, but only between people who haven’t met each other yet).We’re between eight to ten people consistently. Most of the work is done by volunteers for the sheer fun of it. We try to pay everyone who commits to delivering their bit, so there’s people coming on a payroll and leaving and coming back again later. The full-time team is always around 8–10. I think the largest we ever grew to was 11. We’re currently 9.Yes, design first. Back in 1999, I worked at Chip magazine around when they became India’s most popular tech magazine. This was before internet access killed the magazine industry. (Chip later became Digit, but the current Digit is a new avatar.) One of the reasons Chip was very successful was that we took design seriously. I learnt a lot there. That was magazine design, not information design, but it set me down the path of understanding what design was about. Later I came across the work of Edward Tufte and became obsessed. Tufte helped me understand what graphs really were, among many other things. When I started HasGeek, I had already been thinking around design for a good decade.Everything we do has geeks in it.Yes, completely!We’re experimenting with monetisation on Hasjob. Lots of little experiments ongoing. Maybe another month until we know what works.We have no particular interest in organising events. Communities build themselves when you provide an If everyone’s an entrepreneur, who’s working at those companies? I resisted starting HasGeek for almost three years. Entrepreneurship is a lonely, painful journey. You’re a genius or a stubborn idiot or a common garden variety human with no particular insight, and there’s no easy way to tell which one. So if everyone is off on these unproductive trips trying to figure out if there’s any hope down this path, who’s actually doing all the work to keep society running and to pay your own bills?One of the curious thing about ancient Indian society (looking at it from the present) is that “sanyas” was this period in life when you withdrew from society because you had finished being useful. When Chandragupta Maurya (Ashoka’s grandfather) “retired”, he went on a pilgrimage down south, settling in the area near Sharavanabelagola.In those days, retirement/sanyas meant you did this withdrawal thing where you wandered around, settled in some cave and sat there without eating until you died. It was supposed to be this journey of figuring out what your life was about. It’s the source of the modern analogy — mostly used in humour — of climbing a steep hill to meet some guru. In the modern version, you’re not supposed to wonder where that guru gets his food from. In the source material, the chap was sitting there waiting to die! Buddha went on such a sanyas trip, came out enlightened and started Buddhism. You could call him the original entrepreneur because that is what this trip is like.Entrepreneurship is about this totally unproductive period of wandering around wondering what life is about and maybe you’ll have some bright idea that will change the world forever. Only Mahaveera, Buddha, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, Confucius and one or two other fellows went on such trips and came out with ideas that changed the world for millennia. Everyone else just became the funny story about the guru on top of the hill.Somehow in the current decade we’ve become fascinated with sending people off on such trips, with some money to keep them alive, and maybe they’ll change the world in six months flat. It’s just bizarre. I mean entrepreneurship trips, of course. Quit your job, pursue this wild idea that everyone thinks is loony, and just maybe you’ll become the next billionaire. We’re glorifying entrepreneurship to the point of absurdity. Your life is much better if you remain productively engaged in society instead of taking off on such a soul-crushing trip.The event scene in India was so bad when we started that within a year of taking a scientific approach to it, we started making serious money. Revenue increased 20x in two years. By the end of year two, with just two co-founders doing most of the work, we were making 10x we had ever earned as employees. Of course we were spending it all too, but WE were spending it. As first time entrepreneurs, the distinction between spending disposable income and spending on necessary business expenses gets blurred. If you have the power to spend, you must be rich, right? So you do whatever it takes to keep that tap open. By the time we got to 4 years, we realised we had gotten so busy raising the topline that we had forgotten about the bottom line. We weren’t automating enough.Nope, we’ve always been uninterested in VC. Most VCs I’ve spoken to are so busy trying to find the next deal that they can’t step back and think about what they want to achieve. So they’re always feeling insecure about the deal some other VC got, and they’ll try to make themselves comfortable by funding a similar startup. So when talking to VCs, you’re always describing yourself as the Uber of X or the Facebook of Y because, without a comparison, they don’t understand who you are. Not that they are not smart people. They’re just as overworked as the entrepreneurs are.Every entrepreneur is shitting bricks about the fundraise another startup did, and which 20-year-old they’re not paying attention to will surprise them and take over the market. Including me. So you need this total zen-level calm to not get worked up every night. If it’s like this for entrepreneurs, imagine a VC handing out millions of dollars of other people’s money and promising to return it all. Totally shitting bricks too. So we decided we didn’t want this kind of stress. If it came to it, we’d only take money from semi-retired people with too much money and few worries, i.e, angel investors. So far we haven’t needed to.Phani is more a product of his times than you may realise. RedBus was funded by I mean redBus dividends. A profitable company pays dividends. By definition VCs can’t give their upstream investors redBus dividends. That wasn’t the deal. The deal is they return the principal plus interest. When you take external money, you have to be aware of how this works for everyone up and down the chain. Usually learning this is a distraction from also developing your company’s market, so most first time entrepreneurs with VC funding tend to get overwhelmed and make missteps.Almost none of it. I only knew the fairy tales of how glorious entrepreneurship is, and how Bill Gates made so much money from Microsoft, and how Sabeer Batia made so much money from Bill Gates, and you could be the next chap in this chain. That’s pretty much how the common public understands it.Ok, so I worked with Phani’s team before most people had heard of redBus, back when he was just out of college. I used to work at a company called Comat and we used to operate computer telecentres in 800 locations in rural areas around Karnataka. We were looking for computer-based services to sell to rural citizens.This was in 2007. Flipkart had also just started and people in villages weren’t exactly buying books, but they did travel. We approached redBus about selling tickets for them, but since villagers don’t have credit cards, we had to collect cash at the shop and give it to redBus separately. So redBus made an entire second version of their website just for us that had everything except the payment gateway.They were an incredible team and all just recent grads with nothing but excitement for the opportunity. The way they handled this deal may sound obvious to you, but the same year we approached [a big insurance company] to sell insurance policies. Their business people came to meet with us and we told them villagers can’t buy insurance from their website with credit cards. We just needed single-sign-on for our operators and they could keep a virtual account of the sales so we could pay them based on each operator’s sales. The business people looked at each other and were upset. They told me this would involve bringing their tech people into this discussion and that would go nowhere, so they came up with another idea. They would issue individual credit cards to all our operators with the cooperation of their business people friends at the parent bank, and we could just pay the credit card bills of all our operators. Now we were suddenly going to become responsible for the credit card usage of 800 villagers we barely knew. The insurance people liked this idea. They didn’t have to waste time with their tech team and their friends in the bank got some business too.Phani was running the show at redBus then and he ran it until exit — which as far as I can tell neither Seedfund nor redBus enjoyed having to get into. Exit sale, I mean. Huge respect for Phani for what he achieved.You know what’s funny and ironic about this? In 2007, I was a Program Manager at Comat [overseeing the tech team], a bit too high up to be directly interacting with the redBus team. My team worked with their team. I never even met Phani, I just knew we had a deal going for one of many services (while I sat in meetings with the CxOs of banks, etc). He was also several years younger. Today he’s a well established successful entrepreneur figure and I’m just this dude doing this crazy thing that no one knows is sustainable in the long term.There’s something more serious all of you should be aware of. I hope you know that there is a very significant likelihood India will lose network neutrality this year. TRAI makes the rules and over the last few years they’ve more or less turned into an industry-friendly body with almost no representation from citizens. They are currently running an open consultation on whether India needs network neutrality and their opinion document makes it very clear that they intend to remove it. Medianama has been highlighting the bad news and how you can shame TRAI into backing down.Go ahead and share the post for all the members on your social network to have fun reading it!Weve set up a Twitter handle —If you are interested in the startup ecosystem and would like to network with fellow tech founders join the Slack group if you havent already!

If you are male you should probably grow a beard.Choice of laptop also says a lot about you.Other companies at SUP46 are The most famous company in Stockholm is called Spotify. They play music and collect your personal data. It is also Europe’s most famous startup. If your CV contains the word Spotify it means you can get a job at any company at any level in Europe because you are now an expert in “digital”. There is also a company called Mojang. Nobody knows if it is an actual startup or if it’s just one guy that created a game called Minecraft and sold it to Microsoft for $2.5bn or a practical joke played by the guys behind King. Either way, we’re counting it as a unicorn.Apart from Spotify and Mojang there are five other unicorns: Mysql, Skype, King.com, Klarna and Truecaller. Technically you could also count Russian auction site Avito.ru which was founded by two Swedes in Moscow. Before starting Avito the founders had started and sold the largest European auction site The fact that Stockholm has seven unicorns while London, a city with ten times the population, only has twice the number of unicorns is basically Swedish socialism’s subtle way of giving the middle finger to the British labour party. Some people argue that Sweden has unicorns Stockholm is a special place. In the summer we swim in the warm water, in the winter we ice skate on it. We remain a thorn in the side of free market theorists by producing the highest number of unicorns per capita after San Francisco despite offering free schools and universal free healthcare.We also love everything US and have one the biggest country If you want to experience it for yourself several companies are hiring, If you already work here, stop wasting your time reading this and do something productive like paying more taxes.(Big thanks to the guys over at Runs startups, long distances.

1, 2, 3, 4… if only it was as easy as counting to 5As a co-founder, building a badass startup team will not only be one of your first challenges, but also the most important one to get right. Here are some of the tidbits we learned while forming our current, and (I think) The team has to start with me, myself, and I. We mean this in the most humble of ways. The reality is that nobody is going to put in more blood, sweat, and tears to execute your vision than you–although great team members may get close. Remember, in the wise words of …That being said, it is vital that you do enough self reflection to understand what your strengths and weaknesses are, and select your team members accordingly.If your ability to develop a MVP ends at paper cutouts, or if you can’t sell a banana to a monkey, you know exactly which holes in your team need plugging. Targeting people that compliment your strengths and prop up your weaknesses is paramount.We have also found it to be tremendously valuable to do (or in some cases, try What do you have to lose?The goal is to be able to identify what characteristics and qualities are the most important for getting the job done. If you can build a team in which everyone is more efficient than you are at doing the tasks you don’t do well or don’t enjoy doing, you win.Don’t be afraid to try and catch the big fish. If you are a little nervous talking to someone in your field because they are so talented and successful, and you feel a little like a seven-year-old approaching Michael Jordan in 1996 for an autograph, you are probably talking to the right person. You want them on your team!Just like most things in life, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by making yourself a little uncomfortable and taking a chance in recruiting your team members. Having the guts (you can fake it ‘til you make it) to approach the big fish shows just how confident you are in your idea, and increases your chances of landing that dream team.Chances are if you can get a rockstar excited about your startup and vision, you’re doing it right. Success here boosts your chances of locking down investors, and the ever important customers/users, are probably pretty high.The most important interview questions you can ask is:The answers to this question may be incredibly illuminating. Does their answer align well with the vision, the passion, and the culture of your startup? If not, don’t waste your time. Your goal, especially in the early days while building your core team, is to find people who share your passion and are excited about the vision of your startup.Ask interviewees how invested (read: committed) they would like to be to your company on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being all cash compensation and 10 being equity or stock options. You are looking for the ones who answer with a hearty 5 or higher. We believe it is hugely important for employees to buy into your vision, and offering company equity is key. Nothing drives motivation and hard work like ownership; ownership of the task at hand and potential adversity, but also the ownership of success.It is important to seek out team members who are adults and are capable of acting as such. At times, every member of your team will be a project manager. After all, startups are Lastly, this isn’t 1960 and you aren’t selling life insurance (most likely). Having some fun and building the kind of company culture people can get excited about is key to both recruiting badass team members as well as keeping them. You are more than likely going to be asking a lot from your team at times. Whenever possible, try to make work something people are looking forward to. Building a badass team is no good if you can’t retain them.If you’ve enjoyed this post it would really mean a lot to us if you recommended it and shared it around.

Startups are hot in 2015 and have been for years — no secret there. Founders are heroes and entrepreneurship is sexy. I’d imagine this is the reason I keep hearing about the “startups” people are working on, thinking about working on, or possibly might should be working on. The scariest thing about all the startup hype is how many people I see starting business with no idea One of the most frequent questions I field is “When should people do a startup?” It’s a great question with a quite a few answers. Startups exist for a growing amount of reasons and co-founders have different visions and end goals when they kick off new ventures. When this question pops up, I flip it and pose it to my audiences with an inevitable mix of the following responses:The list goes on, but none of these are wrong to be honest. They’re all reasons to do a startup and all of these outcomes are possible.Yet, for every crowd of people I see who Let me be clear — I love entrepreneurship and am a pretty big proponent of starting businesses, but I fully understand the reservations of most people when it comes to launching a venture. What I tell people at this point is a truth that Ive come to from various ventures of my own and advising others on theirs…There, I said it. I teach entrepreneurship at a university and run a creative dev shop that helps people launch ventures. Believe me when I say I’m not doing myself any favors by saying this out loud, let alone publishing it.Even so, it’s the truth. Startups are a tough, ball-crushing, long night working, no sleep getting, not sure you’re sane existence. If you talk to any co-founder, they’ll probably tell you that’s only the half of it. The awesome startup office with a ping pong table, keg, and Nerf gun wars is the exception not the rule. Free lunches every day because you’re funded and have no worries isnt as common as we pretend. You start work at 6am and then you don’t go home for two days. You eat a banana and Top Ramen for lunch and dinner because those are the only two things in the fridge, you haven’t gone shopping in 3 weeks, and you’re not sure if that check to your lawyer is going to clear so you’re have to wait at least another week to shop anyway. For those with savings and a spouse, it’s not much better from what I hear. You might be “comfortable” to start, but every month you burn into your savings to make your “thing” work is another month closer to not having savings if your “thing” doesnt work.The Zuckerbergs, and Cubans, and Bezoses of the world are anomalies, yet the majority of people I talk to expect equal success when they’re envisioning their startup. I’d be remiss if I didnt say otherwise.So…you should do a startup for approximately one reason in my opinion: Changing the world sounds lofty, but that’s the mentality that you have to have to be an entrepreneur. Frankly, it’s too hard otherwise. With that, I don’t necessarily mean “cure cancer” change the world. I mean “my website helps people do the work that they love” or “that guy felt more confident in the shirt I made and he just nailed his job interview” change the world. You have to have the mentality that what you do, whatever it is, is going to put someone in a better place because you did it THAT well.The Side Project is the perfect alternative to starting a business. Keep your day job, build something awesome in your down time, figure out the next move. All the “fun” of a startup with less pain in your ass. It’s beautiful.Full disclosure: you may not enjoy the upside of a rocket ship startup, but that’s the price you pay. Lower risk, lower return. The Side Project The reality is, startups are cool, but they’re not always the answer to the problem we’re trying to solve. It’s about time we stop talking about starting new businesses until we know a business is I build things for a living. CEO 

A friend called me heartbroken, crying. She had spent months looking for investors to fund her fledgling startup and now she had a big problem. Someone was ready to give her the money.Trouble was, the cash came with a catch. The only investor willing to pony-up the money was someone she didn’t like. She also got the feeling he did not like her much either, and yet, he wanted to invest. “If he was involved, I have the feeling I would quit my company down the road,” she told me over the phone.Time was running out, she needed the funds and with no other investor ready to commit, she feared she’d have to take the money from someone she couldn’t stand. The very thought made her sick in the stomach.I felt for her and her dilemma piqued my curiosity. What differentiates a great early-stage investor from someone no entrepreneur wants to take money from unless they absolutely have to? I wanted to know what separated angel investors — those who add value to a company — from devil investors — those who destroy it.Last month, famed investor and Sun Microsystems co-founder, Vinod Khosla, “I don’t know a startup that hasn’t been through tough times,” Khosla said, and it is during these rough patches that he believes many investors fail their companies. But there are more ways an investor can screw a company than giving crummy advice.A classic What is this sabotaging syndrome? It begins innocently enough. The chain reaction usually begins with the “tough times” Khosla says are part of every company’s lifecycle. Sometimes the investor has pre-existing doubts about the CEO’s abilities, but the infection usually starts when the company misses a minor target or isn’t progressing as quickly as anticipated.When things do not go as planned, many investors increase supervision of the company and its CEO. The investor’s doubts in the founder begin to show in subtle cues like body language and tone, as well as in not-so-subtle ways like sending emails asking for more frequent progress reports. The investor may also initiate lengthy discussions, wanting to know how the company intends to get itself back on track.The investor’s questions are legitimate — it’s his money after all. But the byproduct of the increased scrutiny is the deterioration of the founder’s confidence and creativity. The entrepreneur suspects the investor is losing faith and responds by overcompensating in an attempt to fight the investor’s perception.The CEO may start working at an unsustainable pace and demand the company’s employees do the same, squandering mindshare and team morale on unnecessary tasks to placate the investor. Fearful of further disappointing her patron, the CEO may unintentionally paint a rosier view of the company or stop asking for critical feedback.As the founder shares less, the investor interprets the CEO’s closing-up as an inability to surface problems — a sign of poor judgment and a lack of competence. The investor becomes increasingly frustrated and is now convinced that the CEO requires further oversight.But as Khosla admits, investor’s ideas are often crap and with so much attention focused on what the investor thinks is best, the company misses real opportunities.As the study’s authors point out, “Perhaps the most daunting aspect of the set-up-to-fail syndrome is that it is self-fulfilling and self-reinforcing — it is the quintessential vicious cycle.”Taking cues from the more experienced investor, the first-time CEO begins doubting her own abilities. She begins performing her job mechanically, avoids risk-taking and spends more time and energy catering to the investor’s requests. The CEO’s self-doubt fuels poor performance, validating the investor’s suspicions and throwing the company into a self-perpetuating death-spiral, which leaves the once-promising CEO dazed, confused, and often times, out of work.The tragedy of the syndrome is that it is fueled by good intentions. The founder wants nothing more than the company to succeed and the investor has no intention of destroying value in a company he’s invested in. But according to Manzoni and Barsoux, how people with power react in times of trouble can have a considerable and often deleterious impact on others.But the set-up-to fail syndrome is preventable and reversible. Both entrepreneurs and investors can take steps to vaccinate themselves from the disease.When my friend faced the unfortunate choice between an investor she did not want to work with and the potential death of her fledgling company, she had a difficult decision to make. In her case, she decided to keep looking for other investors, believing that starting a company with the wrong person was worse than not starting a company at all.But merely finding a good investor is not good enough. Angels can become devils when conditions bring out the unintended behaviors of well-meaning people.An antidote to the syndrom is acknowledging how people in positions of authority influence the performance of others. Whether it involves investors, bosses, or managers, any supervisory relationship can fall prey to a breakdown of confidence. Investors must beware of the trap of labeling founders as deficient people and instead stick to judging objective outcomes and circumstances.Next, expectations about the degree of supervision should be set early in the relationship. Companies that institutionalize regular dialogues between hierarchies can head-off the syndrome before it gets out of control. A similar practice can help CEOs and investors get along. There are many ways to open the gates to better communication — a topic several Bay Area startup CEOs and investors will For their part, company founders can prevent the onset of the syndrome by understanding its potential impact and guard themselves from the performance drains that come from the downward spiral.The set-up-to fail syndrome can only continue if the CEO perceives that the investor is losing faith in her abilities. Ultimately, founders and investors are on the same team and both want the company to thrive. Therefore, regardless of what the devil investor may say or do, the startup CEO must perform a bit of mental acrobatics to keep her sanity.If the perception of disappointing an investor is getting in the way of guiding the company, the entrepreneur must choose another point of view. Founders must to ward-off the demons of self-doubt by never interpreting investor’s actions as, “You are failing,” but rather, “I want us to succeed.”Both founders and investors can take steps to prevent the potential unwinding of their relationship and their company. The investor must to be aware of his role in shaping the CEO’s actions and serve as a trusted advisor rather than an overseeing elder. Meanwhile, the entrepreneur must inoculate herself by not allowing negativity to thrive, choosing instead to view the investor as an ally rather than a watchman.In my own experience having worked with several fantastic investors, it was always the great ones who not only had insight, but also the humility to confirm that the company CEO knew best. Even during the company’s tough times, interacting with real angels leaves entrepreneur energized, confident, and more creative than before.Real angel investors make founders feel like Gods. They remain faithful in the face of uncertainty and help CEOs rise to the challenge. They imbibe founders with an omnipotent sense that they can do anything, but, like God, they have a lot to do.Here’s the gist:Author of “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products” and blogger at NirAndFar.comInteresting stuff at the intersection of technology, psychology, and business

There are three problems with this approach:Therefore what you So yeah… the new strategy is simple and fast. Just follow the steps:Simple, no? And it works like a charm.Writes a lot. Articles that could help your startup grow.

Starting a shiny new startup is a godawful amount of work — and if you don’t pick the right tools to help you out, it’ll be all the worse. I’m often asked about what stack you should pick when you start a company, and so I decided to put together a somewhat coherent list of handy starting points.Google Apps for Business gives you a ton of useful tools to help you get startedThe first two tools I install on any computer are basic communications tools, including a good e-mail client, a decent VoIP solution, and a web-browser that doesn’t suck.For e-mail, I would always reach for Google’s solutions, for many reasons. Running your own mail servers is a pain in the arse, and there’s almost never a good reason to do so — so sign up for With Google Apps, you get a solid mail client (Google Mail), a great way to collaborate on basic office documents (Google Docs includes a word processor, a very strong spreadsheets solution, and a simple presentations interface), a way of getting information from your customers (Google Forms), and a place to store your files (Google Drive), and much, much more.At Triggertrap, in the past we’ve used For VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), you can’t really go wrong with It happens extremely rarely that I get an e-mail off a colleague these days — which is a good thing, because e-mails are a massive timesink, and if everyone pings off an e-mail over every little issue that needs to be discussed, you’ll never get anything done. Instead of e-mail, we tend to use:There are a lot of schools of thought about how you should do your website, and some of them are easier than others.Personally, I’ll do one of the following: Buy a web domain from Other things I would sign up for right away is However, if you want an even cheaper and simpler solution, head to For bookeeping, there are a few Web 2.0 friendly solutions, but my go-to solution is To take your Xero to the next level, look into There are a lot of customer support solutions out there, some of them are much better than others. My two favourites are Zendesk and There are a thousand and one ways to do sales, but a key element to getting it right is having all the data you need, and reminders about how and when to do follow-ups etc. I’m a huge fan of Crikey what a huge topic. This one deserves an article all to itself, but starting points for further research (and software we use…)There’s not a lot I can say about apps (the development environments etc are owned by our developers, I don’t get a lot of say in the matter — not that I’d want to), but from a marketing point of view, We try to keep our apps available in many languages.

I’ve been lucky enough to work with quite a few early-stage startups at I must have one of those faces: for some reason I’m always being asked for advice. A lot of the time I’m asked about how to First up, you’re running a startup: I’m guessing you don’t have heaps of spare time — it’s But before you look at them, take a look at yourself:When I’ve been talking to potential hires and sifting through job applications in the past, I’ve looked for a couple of key things that have served us pretty well:When you’re a small (often distributed) team in the early stages of startup growth, team balance and fit is a really delicate thing. If it’s your first time around, don’t make a full-time designer hire right away — work through a sample project first and see how well you fit together.And honestly, just be responsible and fair with anyone you’re looking to take on board. As brilliant as your startup might be, anyone joining you is taking at least a bit of gamble on where they’ll be a few months from now. Be honest with yourself, and them. If you handle this hire right, the risk is more than worth it for the huge reward you stand to gain.Absolute sucker for a great bowl of phở. Designer and founder 

For every start-up, first few days are the basic bones for your company future. It is a tough journey full of ups and downs, when every morning starts with a bad news and every dawn ends converts that bad news into something good.I am putting together few key recommendations that I have learned hard way.Product+Growth Just figuring the best way to be you.

Lean Startup is everywhere. Everybody is talking about “innovating like a startup”. It’s been around for quite a few years now. And people started to realize that it needs some adjustments.That’s why one of the last big So how should Lean Startup 2.0 look like? Maybe like In parallel to the people trying to improve and adapt “innovating like a startup” to a completely new market environment a bunch of new trends are currently popping up.One of them being the fact that a lot of so-called “Lean Startup Experts” are now moving more towards corporations.At first it makes a lot of sense.Lean Startup was inspired by the Lean Manufacturing principles, which were used by Toyota to manufacture their cars. And it also makes a lot of sense from a Lean Startup “expert’s” point of view. By the way what’s an expert anyways?So these so called experts move to corporations. Corporations have more money than startups…But if we take a closer look at corporations and Lean Startup we can see a few critical key characteristics that a lot of corporations usually have ingrained into their DNA.A DNA that makes a successful implementation of Lean Startup and all other adjacent methodologies almost impossible.Everyone that ever worked in a large corporation for a few years might be able to underline the complete insanity of trying to implement Lean Startup in corporations.Trying to get the “innovating like a startup” mindset into the tired, exhausted, underused and overworked heads of employees looks like a Sisyphean task to me.Now don’t get me wrong here. I never read the book I just didn’t feel like paying $20+ for a Kindle e-book (that’s how much it costs). Maybe they cover all of these things. If they do, great! Go ahead and read them…And I’m also not a Lean Startup expert.But I’ve observed a few large corporations (from the inside) and tried to understand how they worked. And if I take a look at the ones I saw so far I’m not sure whether or not the people working there might be the best ones to implement, execute and work with these methodologies.After all, it’s the employees that have to execute the stuff their CEOs (or consultants) tell them. They are the most critical success factor. And to me these people are the true bottle neck.The ones that stop (and will probably always stop) corporations from innovating like a startup. And you can’t really blame them either.So if you’re thinking about sprinkling some Lean Startup (or innovating like a startup) pixie dust into your company think about what’ s the actual work mode really like in your company.And if you don’t know what it’s currently like, chances are quite high that it might not be in favor of the things you’re trying to or thinking about implementing…And I also know that most people, especially higher management or CEOs won’t admit it, but the things I’ll be listing down here are unfortunately the truth for many companies. The truth that might ultimately hold your corporation back from innovating like a startup.So here we go:There’s nothing that corporations love more than secrets.That’s why they have huge legal departments and make you sign contracts that pretty much don’t allow you to do anything with the things you’re about to learn.Sometimes you’re not even allowed to work for the competitor for the rest of your life.A lot of companies out there still believe that having an idea for a product and then releasing it to the market will result in success.The idea is the most critical factor. So they protect it. And keep it a secret.But we live in a demand driven economy and not a supply driven economy anymore. So ideas are worth nothing.And most large corporations are just not ready for that paradigm shift. They’re still stuck in old ways of looking at the market environment.Even though a lot of people in higher management positions have recognized this fact, the message can’t really be properly communicated down the hierarchy ladder.Why you may ask? See the next point.Right from the very start of our existence we were trained to not make any mistakes. We were given a script. A script we should follow. A script we have to learn by heart. That’s the only way to pass life’s exams.Not following the script will lead to punishment.You won’t graduate, won’t get a diploma and then you won’t find a job. Not blending in is being punished. That’s why we’re so afraid of making mistakes. Making mistakes equals punishment. And we don’t want to be punished.And punishment in the corporate world means that you’re going to lose your job. You’re going to get fired. You won’t be able to feed your family anymore. You won’t be able to pay that mortgage. So you’re going to play it safe. ALWAYS.Lean Startup on the other hand embraces failure. Well, not exactly failure, but it’s more of a trial  error kind of approach. You try something out, see whether or not it works and then adapt it.And to a lot of people that sounds a lot like making a mistake. Like failure. Like punishment.The general attitude prevailing in most of the corporations, consultancies and banks is to cover your own ass.Everything you do or say has to be backed up by numbers or things that make sure that your ass is covered . That you’re not saying anything wrong. That you’re safe. That your job is safe. That your boss is safe because then you’re also safe.The average employee just doesn’t want to get in trouble.And if you’re always trying to cover your own ass you’re never ever going to take responsibility. Why should you even take responsibility? So that people can blame you afterwards? No, hell no. But that’s exactly what Lean Startup needs if it should be implemented in big corporations.If no one is willing to take responsibility and implement stuff, nothing will ever happen.Everything we see on TV or read in the newspapers fills us with fear.Ever since the financial crisis hit, the dominant news are either about people losing their jobs, companies having to shut down, people being People generally don’t trust anyone anymore. And most importantly employees don’t trust their boss’s bosses anymore. They might trust their immediate boss but that’s not the person making any decisions.CEOs make decisions. And one day they might say this and then the other day they might say something completely different.The average employee has seen her trust being betrayed one too many times…Being filled with fear and constantly trying to cover your ass will in the mid to long run lead to a “it wasn’t me attitude”. A “I don’t want to be associated with this” kind of attitude. An attitude where no one wants to be held accountable for anything.An attitude where everybody is just taking care of his own silo. An attitude that limits people’s point of view and their thinking. Most people are just stuck in their own silo thinking.“I do marketing, so I don’t care about all the other stuff.”This leads to an environment that can be totally lethal for innovation. An environment where everyone is just following his own script. The safe script.Employees are driven by their own scripts. The scripts that are being handed over to them at the beginning of each year. The script that tells them what to do, what to achieve and how they can get as much of their bonuses as possible.And these are the only people (there might be some exceptions) a corporation can employ. Because the people that are willing to take more risk will seek their luck outside of corporations.They’ll go out, experiment, learn, adapt and tweak their own ideas.They’re the ones being able to innovate like a startup. Outside of corporations. Far away from numerous gatekeepers, naysayers, budget cuts and thick hierarchy layers.Risk takers might stay at a corporation for a while. Until they saved enough cash to do it on their own. Until they’re confident enough…These days it’s easier than ever before in the history of mankind to create your own stuff (and distribute it).You don’t need any programming skills to build a business anymore. You can easily outsource it for dead cheap. Or you can use all kinds of tools. There are tools for almost everything out there.And if you’re a risk taker you won’t stay in the cozy corporate environment. You’ll go out. You’ll start building things. You’ll create things. You’ll be like Richard Branson telling yourself all the time “When a CEO takes a decision (e.g. innovate like a startup) it all might be totally clear to her what should be done, how it should be done and so on. But as a matter of fact most CEOs somehow forgot about the daily struggles of the average employee.The average employee (the ones executing their strategy) is struggling with a lot of other things. An employee’s bandwidth is usually already fully booked with his daily tasks. The daily grind.They fight for their own survival. They fight their own fights.And a CEO introducing a new concept, project, tool or whatever will usually not be taken very seriously. The average employee has seen countless CEOs come and go. And they know that this CEO will be gone rather sooner than later.And with them they’ve seen their shiny projects come and go…But even more importantly than all of the above points is the fact that most corporations are just way too afraid to deliver half baked products. Corporations are too afraid to upset and disappoint their already existing customers with half baked products.And it totally makes sense.The negative publicity they might get would just kill them. If you’re a startup and your first version of a product still kind of sucks it doesn’t really matter. If ten people talk shit about you, you don’t care.But if 1 million people talk shit about you, you’ll definitely care.That’s why large corporations have an entire department that takes care of PR. That double (or even triple) checks every little piece of content that leaves the corporation’s sacred halls.I guess the only way corporations could be enabled “to innovate like startups” (and use methodologies such as Lean Startup) is by founding completely separate entities. Entities that are not associated to the mother company at all.And someone a lot As this might only work on a theoretical level (because of all the above reasons) I feel that the thing I’m going to describe might be a possible future for all “Lean Startup Consultants, Experts or Agencies” out there.People, entities or agencies that test and validate products with existing methodologies, such as Lean Startup, Customer Development and the These independent agencies/companies will bring an entire product to market (and try to get product-market fit right) under a different brand, no brand at all or a whitelabel solution.A product the corporation pretty much tells them to build and then test and validate on the market (with real sales).And once this entity has achieved product market fit, the mother entity/the client could simply take over the already validated and successful product and release it to their customers under their own brand.It’s some sort of new company builder approach I would say (but as a service for large corporations). A bit like an accelerator, but then again not really…Now should these agencies or whatever you want to call them be paid per project? Should they get equity? I don’t know. But it definitely sounds intereting.Anyways, if you’re a Lean Startup “expert” or someone that’s currently facing the problem of not being able to “innovate like a startup”, feel free to get in touch with me to exchange some thoughts (and/or help me understand more of this stuff).These are just my two cents worth on the entire “innovating like a startup” discussion…Feel free to also connect with me on LinkedIn P.S.

Lo pensé un rato y le dije: “Pues si tuviera que nominar a alguien, sería a tu cofounder, Jordi Muñoz”. La respuesta de Chris fue: “No, no me refiero a eso. Jordi es un joven muy capaz, pero ya contaba con recursos económicos. Yo me refiero a alguien que haya arrancado desde cero y sin recursos”. Después de pensarlo un rato, le dije “no se me ocurre nadie, y ahora que lo dices creo que como país no contamos con las condiciones para que surja alguien así”.Desde entonces he estado reflexionando al respecto y comparándolo con lo que veo en Estados Unidos. En EUA es relativamente común encontrarse con jóvenes emprendedores que a pesar de no venir de familias con recursos económicos o contactos, logran hacerla en grande y rápido. Mientras tanto, en México esto todavía es algo rarísimo.Hay dos factores que yo creo que son determinantes para esto:a) Acceso al crédito. En EUA, los típicos chavos emprendedores de garage cuando arrancan lo más probable es que no tengan dinero en el banco, pero hay algo que sí tienen: tarjetas de crédito. Es muy probable que financíen el desarrollo de su producto con sus tarjetas de crédito. Ya si no funciona el emprendimiento, se conseguirán un empleo y las pagarán. En México, este tipo de financiamiento todavía es escaso y caro. El porcentaje de población con tarjeta es bajo, los intereses son caros, y los límites de crédito son bajos. ¿Y pedir un préstamo al banco? Olvídalo, eso es solo para los que ya tienen dinero, no para los que lo necesitan.b) Apertura por parte de empresas. Otra cosa que veo que en EUA es distinto a Mx, es la apertura de empresas a escuchar e interactuar con emprendedores. Si tienes un producto que consideras que puede ser de interés para X empresa, es relativamente fácil conseguir que la persona de compras te tome la llamada, te atienda y evalúe tu producto objetivamente y sea honesta contigo diciéndote cuales son sus criterios de calidad, si tu producto los cumple, a qué precio le compra a la competencia, etcétera. En México, esto es complicadííííísimo. Hay empresas donde si no tienes palanca, simplemente no logras que siquiera te tomen la llamada.Esto me lleva a hacerme la siguiente pregunta:Queriendo discutir al respecto en Twitter, la conversación rápidamente tomó todo tipo de tangentes. De toda esa discusión, rescato lo que comentó Jorge Madrigal, diciendo que aunque este es un problema en Mx, se puede mitigar un poco teniendo equipos heterogeneos con perfiles y habilidades diversas. Concuerdo.PD — De la pregunta central de esta nota, hago énfasis en el “bajo un esquema de startup”. Es decir, estoy consciente que hay muchos casos de personas que empiezan desde abajo, sin nada, y después de muchos años de trabajo logran tener negocios exitosos y grandes fortunas. Pero eso no es a lo que me refiero. Me refiero a alguien que un día apenas le alcanza para la renta y la comida, y arranca un startup que tiene éxito y un par de años después está teniendo ingresos (o inversión) por millones de dólares. Tampoco estoy hablando de todos los agraciados que reciben alguna concesión/contrato del compadre y se hacen millonarios de la noche a la mañana.——-Update: Platicando al respecto con César Salazar de 500 Startups, me dice que hace un año veía lo mismo, pero que en los últimos 12 meses ha visto casos que lo están haciendo cambiar de opinión y creer que ya está siendo posible que personas comunes y corrientes, sin muchas palancas ni dinero, levanten inversión y tengan un startup exitoso. Ojalá sea así, ya que creo que sería un genuino avance del ecosistema local de emprendimiento tecnológico.Este es mi espacio para opiniones personales.

I’ve been listening to a fabulous audiobook called “The Martian,” in which an astronaut is left behind on Mars with a limited amount of food. It’s riveting. *The stranded botanist/engineer has to “make it work with what he’s got.”This of course got me thinking, what if your startup was left behind? What if the eight months of runway you have was all you were going to have — would you survive?[ * You can get “The Martian” free at In boom times most founders don’t think like this because, to continue the analogy, there is a never ending stream of resupply ships in our startup galaxy. Very few people are looking at “months until I run out” — let alone “days until out.”[ Click to Tweet (can edit before sending): I’ve made it a mission of force that the founders in which I invest know — off the top of their heads — how many months of runway they have. It’s so important that I ask them to make it the first line of their monthly investor updates (I wrote a “How many months of runway do you have?” I asked one awesome founder.“I’m not sure …” he replied.“How much are you spending and making each month?” I asked.“Umm … well, we don’t charge for our product yet since we’re going for growth, so I know one number perfectly: zero revenue” he replied.“OK, so your “Well, I think we spent like $60k or $80k last month … but we had the legal issue, so maybe $100k? But wait, we had to put down $50k for our office rental …” he blabbered.“Stop.” I paused, before continuing, “It’s your job to know. Go back to your team, pull up every month’s PL and review it with everyone. Every week get your balance from your bank accounts sent to you and know what you got!”He nodded. He got it together and now he knows.At any time I can tell how much money, revenue, spend, and burn the two companies I run have. This lets me know our runway, which I define in months. By knowing the months I can develop a plan. By executing that plan, I can avoid dying.Inside.com has been in the market for 18 months and LAUNCH for four years — so it makes sense that one is in ‘figure out the product’ and one is in ‘scale the business’ mode.There are basically three “acts” at a startup:That’s really it.Elon figured out he could build an electric car with the Roadster, he figured out it could be a business with the Model S, and he will figure out how to scale the business with the Model 3 (the $35,000 car for everyone).Some companies have the business built in like Uber, so they just have to figure out the product and the revenue (their % of each fair) takes care of the rest. SaaS products are also typically designed with #2 “built in.”That’s why enterprise software companies are harder to kill!So, at Inside.com we are moving from stage one to stage two. We know folks love mobile news and so I’m figuring out, “How can we make $50,000 a month in revenue?” If we figure this out we would extend our runway by another three months. If we figure out how to make $100,000 a month we obviously extend our runway by another four or five months.The great news about figuring out #2 (your business), is that it attracts investors who can extend your runway! For every $25,000 in monthly revenue you land, you can expect 20x that in investment!So, my strategy with LAUNCH is, “How do we double the size of Our first stab at this will be to partner with a drone maker on our Inside Drones App, an Inside Drones podcast, and a live event. If that works, maybe we can get a partner for Inside Space, Inside Cannabis, and Inside Video Games. If that sounds like what I did with Engadget, Autoblog, and Joystiq, but on mobile, well, you’re right!There are three main ways in which “the martian” (in the novel) can live longer:Your startup has the same model:Take time to focus on A, B, and C on a regular basis. With regard to C, my “hack” is to do yearly meetings with partners to “catch up” and “fill them in.” I did this over the past two months and all of a sudden we had some MA interest in Inside.com from major tech and media companies.So make a plan and think about — but don’t obsess over — these three things.Given this, I suggest to all teams that they make a plan to “get there on what you got!”Your GTOWYG plan basically says, “If the market for funding ends would this business make it until the investors come back?”There are a million ways to ask these questions, and having a founder discussion (or founder  lead investor) is always a good use of an hour or two.Note: I’m not saying we’re in a bubble and it’s going to pop, but I am saying things are frothy and eventually markets correct to some degree. Have a plan for when they do.all the best, @I angel invest in awesome startups... and try to build them myself. Be excellent to each other.

With each passing year, elections are getting more and more expensive. In 2016, campaign spending alone will reach $5 billion in the US. So we talked to leading entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and asked them, what can we do to change this? Shouldn’t anyone be able to buy an election?Today, we’re glad to announce Elector, a new sharing economy for voting. Think of us as the ‘Airbnb’ of elections. Not using your vote, sell it to the biggest political spender. Indifferent to politics, have a billionaire put your vote to use. Planning on voting but want earn some side income, go for it.Set to launch ahead of the 2016 elections (pending App store approval), you’ll find your favorite financiers on our marketplace. From concerned corporations like Phillip Morris to influential individuals like Ron Conway, our financiers are ready to buy your pledge.You’ll find that with Elector, both sides can win.We used Elector with San Francisco voters and influencers in the weeks leading up to municipal elections and the response was amazing.

Resilience and endurance are two words extremely used in the startup medium. “You have to be resilient”, “You’ll need endurance to go through the hardships” are things not uncommon to be heard when we see founders telling their success stories. So, if we know this is such an important characteristic to have “make it” as someone in the tech world, how can we prepare ourselves?Something that has worked amazingly for me are actually the lessons taken from when i’m trying to push my body over the limit. Take for example endurance sports such as triathlons, in the beginning when you are not tired, if you are not trained, it is easy to get ahead of ourselves and spend some extra energy trying to get a little ahead, but these few seconds we gain in the beginning of the race may cost a lot more by the end of it, just because we are full of energy does not mean we need to give it all in one burst, it is important to plan and know what lies ahead so you can act accordingly.On the other hand, by the end of the race your body might be telling you the exact opposite, “Listen dude, I can’t do this anymore, let’s stop and rest”, it is at this point that you need to use your mental resilience to give your body the endurance that it needs, you decide when to quit, not your legs. Sheer willpower will make a huge difference.So if we can consciously act on our body to push it a little harder and a little further to get where we want, why not the same can’t be said about our minds? When performing a difficult or demanding task, when we are emotionally tired or stressed our brain might want to tell us to quit, to rest, “Leave it for tomorrow”, “You can’t do this” you might hear, this is when you have to take control, and revisiting moments when you gave that extra Also having a clear goal, a real finish line helps to maintain our endurance, the same can be said when we are performing grey mass demanding tasks, knowing where we want to get and what is the reward when getting there will help us go on.Just as in any sport, training and persistence will get you ready for the “race day”, to pull a hat trick every time you need to push through a difficult task or a demanding month is not probable. And just as in any sport if you over-train , or push too hard for too long, you’ll end up hurting yourself and actually be “out of the game”, or in brain context out of “your” game for a while. So to thrive in the startup world we need to be brain and emotional athletes, we need to be exposed homeopathically to challenges so we can overtake the big mountains when they appear, we need to push ourselves a little further everyday, and by the end of it we can actually make it look easy.VC pursuing entrepeneurial experiece, currently BizDev @ Tradecraft

Last month, one of our developers noticed that we were hitting 75% disk capacity on the server used by our mailer application. We checked it out because that wasn’t supposed to happen if things were running smoothly. What we found was that a number of failed jobs were being kept by the system, which meant that these were taking up a ton of space that they shouldn’t have been.To fix the issue, we put together a script to delete the failed items, since any retries to send them didn’t appear to work. After running the script, the mailer application was restarted. A few hours later, we started receiving a The replies we received showed that most of our users were both understanding and pretty chill about us flooding their inboxes unintentionally.Problem solved? Not really.Let’s backtrack a little to the months before.We noticed three specific things:Naturally, since our conversions were down, we had to think up big solutions—because a drop in sales equated to a We broke down the timeline of what went wrong and where, pooling together input from all sides of the company: having meetings with our marketing team, revisiting our internal workflow—basically, getting our house in order with the things we could think of to improve.We had data gathered. Something was up, we knew that much. We just couldn’t find the actual root cause which (three months down the line and a mad scramble for an email apology later) was something a lot smaller than any of these things: our mailer.Was this a big problem? Yeah.Our figures speak for themselves: twenty-five percent lost in monthly revenue is BIG anywhere.Was the cause big? Definitely not. We were just looking at all the wrong places.It’s said that prevention is always better than the cure, but nobody actually listens to that until the problem bites them in the ass. At the time, we didn’t know that there was something to prevent. Now that we do, here are the things we’ve set in place:Currently, we’ve availed of We’ve set individual alerts for pending email thresholds and the number of current active mailer workers set for a particular period.This is important in the event that our mailer queue exceeds a given size or if the emails sent during a specific period drops below a certain count — we get notified straight away.You see, we used to look in on it manually—which is just time-consuming and stupid when there are better ways to check.Attempts to replicate the issue and isolate what exactly caused the mailer workers to die have been done. Unfortunately, we haven’t come up with anything conclusive except that the workers stalled even if the code we had in place for them continued to run.We knew three things about the mailer: (1) it sends emails on demand, (2) the queue size on the server shouldn’t grow too much if existing/new jobs are continuously being processed; and (3) since each worker has their own connection to the server, any drop implies that active workers have decreased.That these things weren’t happening should have been taken into account. But with so many other things going on, we figured the mailer was an isolated incident—one that had nothing to do with our sales drop that seemed more pressing at the time.It This little guy was in charge of checking in to see if people were interested in moving from trial to paid. It was also the one who made sure that people knew that we’d received their payments or if they were lagging behind.Had we better documented the mailer server process operation, dependencies, and functions, we could have determined that, since it wasn’t doing what it was supposed to, this had a direct correlation to why our sales weren’t doing well.We were already aware that our mailer application is responsible for sending forum notifications and scheduled emails to check in with our users. Some members of the team noticed that the notifications weren’t being sent; and over on the support end, we also got less replies from our “check in” emails.Had any of us just spoken up about these issues to each other, we could have investigated things sooner. We let these go because, like we mentioned, we thought that whatever was happening to the mailer couldn’t possibly be that bad. Now, no matter how negligible something appears, we make it a point to chime out to each other (just in case that someone else picked up on something).At the risk of sounding cheesy: best to assume that everything’s connected.Despite every counter-measure that we’ve now put into play: this doesn’t change the fact that we’ve had to do the equivalent of Yes, this kind of thinking should be a We’re laying out the facts as they are because this experience in accountability and immediate response is not just applicable to a young business like ours. We’re sharing this in the hopes that other startups and entrepreneurs will have something to take away.Ours, is that even the (seemingly) little things can have a pretty major impact. It’s been a hard lesson learned. A very Do more with cloud storage. Do more with Google Drive.

At For those, however, that really are trying to establish a new product/service/business, you might want to think a little harder before pitching any of the following five ideas:I’ve seen this pitched at just about every Startup Weekend I’ve been to (over a dozen) as well as just about every other pitch based event. Yes, in some countries and cities, booking a taxi can be a pain, and yes, building an app that enables you to book a taxi has some value. It’s been done. Many times. It’s just an app, and you’re going to have a problem making money with it.The reality is, that in most places where this is a problem, it’s a pain for the passengers and a nice-to-have type problem for the taxi companies, who have bigger problems to worry about, typically how to most efficiently use their fleet of vehicles to make the most money.I think there’s space for disruption in the Taxi market, but I don’t think it’s in passenger booking apps, and if you don’t understand the inner workings of running a transportation based business, it’s going to be much tougher than you imagine.Whether it’s recommendations, photography, menus, recipes, or diet communities, about 80% of the events I’ve been present at have had a food related pitch. And why not? It’s a huge factor of our daily lives.Few companies have successfully started and gained traction in the food related markets. This should give you an idea of how tough this market is, and that’s before you start to think about a revenue stream that doesn’t involve advertising.The one area where I can’t wait for innovation is restaurant website menus. There’s a couple of companies providing platforms for this, but it’s hard to see if they’re making traction. The hardest part is not the technology, it’s the sales/marketing to the restaurants - very labour intensive.Bazillions of drivers, all heading in the same direction, and we could benefit each other and the environment by combining our rides. I get it. I really do. Add to that those who don’t drive and want to hitch a ride too. It’s all good.This product comes down to communication, convenience, trust and personal space. Don’t underestimate the scale and complexity of these issues. Oh and revenue stream? Everyone seems to focus on a % of the transaction, which means that a) you need your users to make/receive payments in a way that could cause them tax issues and b) you need to build/implement a payment service, which is no small thing.I’ve seen this at various events and so far, only one of the teams has managed to launch a real service. Too early to tell if they will survive, but they did manage to figure out a niche revenue stream, which probably puts them in a much stronger position that the rest.Oh, and until you can instantly convince women to use it, you’re probably not onto a winner.Social events for small groups are, apparently, really hard to organise. Actually, I’ve had experience with this, sometimes it’s like trying to herd cats. Lazy and unmotivated cats at that. Surely there’s space for an app to solve this?No. Well, yes, possibly, but in my opinion it all comes down to the root cause of the problem, and that’s people and culture. It’s not the organising of the event itself that’s the problem, it’s the act of a large group trying to please everybody and inevitably failing that makes such tasks tiresome. Even with the most spectacularly well thought out, democratic work flow app, without an agreement between users that sometimes life isn’t fair, this is always going to be a problem.Oh, let’s not forget, where’s the money? The competition (Facebook, email, phone etc) is free and already ubiquitous.Every. Single. Time. There’s a reason that this market is dominated by just a few massive players. It’s seriously hard. Most of my comments regarding the Ride Sharing app also apply here, although I would add that this is one area where I think there’s room for something new an exciting. I just wish I knew what it was.—And with all that said - it’s worth remembering that Google was not the first search engine, the iPhone wasn’t the first smart phone and Apple has done well at creating markets from nothing, so don’t let my comments put you off. If you think you can do better - go right ahead and hustle your way into domination.Works with companies  individuals to inspire, educate  support them to step outside of their comfort zone, whilst making new ideas come to life.

During my short stay in Belgium the week of February 9th, on top of meeting a bunch of entrepreneurs, I’ve also met with On my way back to SF, I’ve stumbled upon Our role is primarily to be just a catalyst, to spawn conversations and synthesize them. Our first step was to put a process in place so that we can move fast, iterate, and build consensus while at the same time making sure that everyone can contribute and make their voice heard.That’s how we came up together with the initial core team (It may seem idealistic (it is), but I thought it would be an interesting exercise to throw something out there as a “what if anything was possible?”. Ready? Go!Why? Because a startup is like a seed. We’ll have more success if we first grow them in a pot inside where there is no wind, no insects, and no external predators. And only when they grow big enough to be more resilient, we can move them outside in the garden when they can continue their growth.What are the needs of an early stage startup?concretely…A founding team should be able to quickly create a startup online in an hour or less (that’s how much time it took me to incorporate Storify inc. on incorporation.com). When the startup fails, it should be easy to tear it down.A founding team should be able to quickly hire or fire people at will. People who take the risk to join a startup should be fine with that. It’s all about setting the right expectations.It shouldn’t cost anything to quit your job and start your company, that means that people should be getting free social security and unemployment benefits for up to (e.g.) 2-3 years (we give that to people at the CPAS, why not to people who want to create an economic activity before they start turning any profit?).The most important thing for a founding team is to be hyper focused on finding their product market fit. Anything else is a distraction.That’s why, it’s counter productive to tempt them with subsidies of any kind that require research, filing paperwork, follow up and so on. So — for their own interest — such entity should not be eligible to any subsidy at all. That said, in reality, they will actually get subsidies automatically since they will be part of the social security system without having to contribute before they turn any profit.That’s a much better way to give subsidies to all startups without discrimination. Everybody gets the same opportunity to start something without having to pay anything, without having to apply for any subsidy.I never took any subsidy for Storify even though I’ve been offered some. It’s not only a distraction, but it’s also dumb money. The people who take the decision to give you that money know nothing about what you are trying to achieve. They will challenge you on things that don’t matter. It’s much better to get money from people who’ve done it before, who know your industry and who will be able to ask the right questions and connect you to the right people to make your company move forward.The taxation regime also needs to be hugely simplified, because it’s a huge distraction. Before startups make money, there shouldn’t be much taxes to collect anyway so the loss for the government is very limited, but the gain for the entrepreneur in terms of reducing distraction is huge. Once there is profit then sure there should be taxes. I’m all for profit sharing because it means that I’m also making profit. Everybody wins.What makes startups more likely to be successful is that they are not limited by old artificial limits. There is no reason to restrain them to live in a certain place or to force them to hire people coming from a certain region. At Storify we hired people from different countries. At some point we were 7 people speaking a total of 7 different languages. That means among other things that startups should be able to sponsor a visa for qualified people.A direct flight Brussels — San Francisco.Once the startup grows up, starts making profit and hires more and more people, it can’t stay in its small pot. We need to move it to a more stable ground where it will continue to grow its roots. That’s when the startup will have to transition to an existing legal status for companies with all its laws and protections for employees that make it more rigid but also more stable. Everyone wins.We can’t possibly think about asking something to the collectivity without thinking about what we will be giving back. We are asking for permission to experiment new things, a new legal status, a new type of company. But what would be the benefit for all of us as a society?By reducing the friction and the barrier of entry to create your startup, we could expect more startups to be created. The goal would be to create 10,000 new startups in the next 5 years, creating 100,000 jobs.Capital gain should be taxed the exact same way as regular income.Come on guys, let’s stop the bullshit of the 1% that says that their way of making money is different than the way of making money for the 99%. It’s not. Generating revenue with your sweat or with your capital shouldn’t be different. Therefore, the profit should be taxed the exact same way. Don’t worry, being in that scenario is a very good problem to have. And even after income-level taxes on the capital gain (instead of currently zero!), you will still be richer than all of your friends. Relax.This one is very idealistic and might not be really feasible in the short term. But ideally, the financial arm of the government should have direct access to the bank accounts of the startup. That will remove the need for the founding team to file tax reports. The government will know how much profit there is and they could just take their cut. That will also greatly reduce abuse. Remember, this would only be for early stage startups. Once they graduate to become real companies, this won’t apply.I understand that this may seem very risky and that this could open the door to abuse. We need to be ok with the fact that whatever we will come up with won’t be perfect. It won’t cover all the needs, and it won’t please everybody from the get go. It would be foolish to think that we could find the right solution at the first try. That’s why it’s important to put ourselves in a situation where failure doesn’t cost much and where we could iterate quickly. To do so, I would recommend to be very ambitious but limit the scope to a certain type of startup and limit also the number of startups who could claim that status. I’m a big believer in the mantra “Make it work for one before trying to make it work for all”. So that if we fail (and we will make mistakes and that’s ok), not much damage will be done and we could quickly get back on our feet. After all, that’s also how you learned how to ski isn’t it?If you paid attention, even though it’s about the Belgian Startup Manifesto, there is nothing in this proposal that would limit the creation of such entity to Belgian people living in Belgium. In fact, Spanish people living in Berlin could potentially as well create such entity, in the same way that I’ve created my startup (Storify) in the Delaware state (using incorporation.com), but the HQ was in San Francisco and I’m Belgian).In the same way that Belgium has been at the forefront of the creation of the European Union, we have the opportunity to create the foundation for a new Europe of People Doing Stuff. Like with the EU, it has to start with the economic angle. That’s why we need to create a new foundation for a new type of economic entity called “the startup”. A smaller, more agile entity that is better suited for the world of today and tomorrow.Cofounder/CEO of Storify.com (acquired by Livefyre).

I have been a wantrepreneur and a rice picker for the past three years.I was working in banking and constantly coming up with business ideas like But then I discovered Reading Tim’s book ignited a whole new way of thinking for me. Until that point every business book I read was littered with theory, or had examples of the problems multi-billion dollar companies faced; optimizing supply chains, for example.How does that help me figure out how to start and operate a business, with almost no money or experience?Tim’s book showed me that starting a business doesn’t have to be such a scary and confusing undertaking. Maybe there are very clear steps and strategies that can be taken. Maybe I can start small, in a niche I understand, test it, and build or pivot from there.I started looking for anything and everything that could teach me more about starting a business.I didn’t hear about podcasts until 2009 when one of my college professors would record her lecture and upload it as a podcast on BlackboardJackpot. A show called I still remember the very first episode I ever listened to in August 2011.It was episode #180 hosted by I listened to it while eating lunch in my car on the road for work. I actually remember not understanding what they were talking about several times throughout the show, like participating preferred shares, A rounds, B rounds, etc. WTF does all this mean?!?Looking back this is actually a nice informal gauge to see how much I have learned since then.From that very first episode of This Week In Startups, I was hooked. I hunted for similar shows on iTunes.I didn’t want anything to do with the I wanted to learn exactly how to start a business from people who have done it.I found two more shows that looked perfect: I started devouring these episodes.From an early age I have always wanted to be an entrepreneur. The key word is “wanted.” For some reason I never really acted on that desire. And this always made me feel like I didn’t have something that natural born entrepreneurs have.We always hear the impressive stories of how “true entrepreneurs” have been starting and running companies since they were kids.While listening to these stories, I would always think of how embarrassed I would be if someone asked me my background as an entrepreneur growing up. I wouldn’t really have anything to say.I was just a normal kid growing up, and I was more interested in basketball than starting businesses.Actually, I still owe all of my grade school friends $50 each because I never made it to the NBA (Yes, I had a lemonade stand. Yes, I sold parking spaces at my mom’s law office building during the annual art festival. Yes, I was buying and trading what I thought would be millions of dollars worth of basketball cards (But these aren’t the cool stories of 13-year-olds building companies.I could embellish these stories to make myself look cooler, but why?Maybe not starting businesses when I was younger makes me less of a “true entrepreneur” in the eyes of some now, but that is okay.I knew I had a knack for business, but I had no idea how to get started on any of my business ideas.My plan to learn was to study business in college, get a job in banking, and go to a top 20 MBA program. I was sure I would know how to start a business after that.Not only did I not know how to start a company, but before podcasts I didn’t even know what I didn’t know.I went back and listened to every single episode of This Week In Startups, and as many of Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders and Mixergy as I could.I listened in the car, during flights, at the gym, during lunch, cooking dinner — basically any free moment I had.I was always traveling for work, so podcasts were perfect for me. I had 3–4 hour drives every Monday and Friday, which I could not wait for so I could listen to more episodes.I used to hate traveling, but now because of podcasts I loved it so much I would sometimes drive laps around the neighborhood after getting home just to finish an episode.Never before had I heard so many real people telling stories of starting companies in such a personal and informal way like this. They usually spared no details and talked about lessons learned from successes and failures alike.This is why I love podcasts.Yes there are blog posts on just about every startup topic, but they are usually edited and polished. Podcasts are more real. More raw.(Guests can prepare, but they can’t anticipate every question the host will ask. This usually leads to an honest conversation about topics not normally covered. The details.Sometimes guest’s answers are profound. Sometimes they talk about ideas and resources so cool that you almost crash your car trying to take notes (dangerous). Sometimes you laugh in the gym and everyone stares at you (awkward).You can tell a lot from someone’s tone. You can hear and feel the passion when Andrew Warner starts every show with “Hey there, freedom fighters,” Do I know everything there is to know about starting and running a company now? Hell no.

How does one find new startup ideas?Every business is built around solving a customer pain. Solving a customer pain creates value which in turn, if successfully harnessed, can be monetized. Platforms, in particular, connect demand and supply to solve customer pain on both sides.One of the patterns for new startup ideas, that I often see in platforms, is the following:This requires a unique combination of two factors:A good balance of both factors is required. If the scarcity is already being addressed, there may not be any need for a new solution. If the surplus is already monetized, it may be difficult for the producer to engage with more means of monetizing the surplus.Hence, both aspects are equally important for the platform to exist. Also, depending on which of the two aspects is stronger, the seeding of the platform may start either with tapping the demand or with harnessing the surplus.At the very outset, let me clarify that this is one of many different patterns for finding new startup ideas. Even among platforms, many different form of patterns exist.Surplus may exist in various forms. It may be a surplus of time, attention, money, physical commodities. Let’s look at a few examples below:A surplus of accommodation in a particular location during a certain time periodMEETSA scarcity of accommodation in that same location during the same time period.A surplus of time to perform certain tasksMEETSA scarcity of time to perform those same tasks.A surplus of investable capitalMEETSA scarcity of capitalA surplus of niche skills and talentsMEETSA scarcity of niche skillsA surplus of knowledge on a niche topicMEETSA scarcity of knowledge on the same topicA surplus of physical itemsMEETSA scarcity of those same physical itemsA surplus of niche creativityMEETSA scarcity of niche entertainmentThis model isn’t limited to online networks alone. Offline spaces also allow this model if you can achieve concentration of supply within a limited physical space. Coworking spaces like The Hub are an example of such a model, matching a surplus of office space with those in need of one.For a given idea,1. IDENTIFY THE COMMODITY THAT’S BEING TRADED, A TARGET SEGMENT WHERE A SURPLUS EXISTS AND A SEGMENT WITH A SCARCITYAgain, surplus and scarcity that are currently not being utilized or satisfied are likely to come on board much faster.2. DETERMINE DEGREE OF OVERLAP BETWEEN THE TWO TARGET SEGMENTS TO ALLOW THE TRANSFER TO OCCURSince scarcity and surplus need to be matched, there should be a high level of overlap between the two sides. Hence, it often helps to start by 3. DETERMINE FACTORS BASED ON WHICH THE TWO SIDES WILL BE MATCHEDThe matching needs to be determined based on certain factors to ensure that the scarcity and surplus successfully satisfy each other. Quora determines matches through an “Ask To Answer” feature which surfaces the users most likely to have an answer to a certain question based on their history of answers on that topic. AirBnB matches accommodation surplus with scarcity based on time (exact dates) and location (exact place).In summary,Exploring the disruption caused by online and mobile platforms

That was the vision I created whilst I was MD at Startup Accelerator, Many of the startups I’ve worked with don’t quite realise the importance of setting the right vision early on in their life. They often have a The most important thing about an early stage vision is how it tackles the problems of a specific person or target audience. Going back to lean startup principles, great companies are formed by solving a compelling problem for a large enough group of customers, so it stands to reason that your In the accelerator we saw a few teams that came in with a product vision, but once their early products were invalidated the teams ended up pivoting around customer segments rather than iterating new solutions. Great entrepreneurs care about making a difference for a particular group of people; for these people, the same problem can be solved in many ways — if your current product doesn’t solve it, the customers’ problems don’t go away, but your product easily can.When At Lightning Lab we had thirteen core values that defined our culture and how we wanted to be as a team. At one event we hosted at the Lab, we received a negative comment about our core values, suggesting thirteen were too many to be useful and three would be more appropriate.I thought about this over the next few days — I’ve seen plenty of companies who have values like “Integrity, Trust, and Honesty”, but these are ‘table-stakes’ for me, and after considered thought I stood by the values we created.Why? Because Of course this is how it worked for us in the Lab, but I do think these wider lessons apply to other startups, especially early-stage as In the intense pressure and hustle of early stage startup it’s easy to push softer-skills down the list of priorities in favour of business modelling and iterating product, but at the end of the day, products fail and markets come and go, butPassionate entrepreneur building a sustainable tech startup ecosystem in New Zealand.

In this post, we’ll share how our team at The Lean Startup Conference uses customer development to shape our product design.Every January, a good 10 months before our next conference, our core team holds 45-minute calls with alumni to learn whether or not they’ve gained the knowledge they’d hoped to get at our previous conference. Additionally, we talk to potential customers all year round to discover what struggles new community members are facing.The benefits to conducting feedback early are two-fold: If you’re looking for an additional application of this idea, We practice a continuous and ongoing learning process. To maximize the time of the core team, we divide and conquer. We segment our customer base into four key groups: young startups, established businesses, enterprise, and government/education/nonprofit. This process allows us to streamline the analysis portion of our efforts, which in turn allows us to see themes and share findings within the team, on an ongoing basis.Next up, each team member interviews 1–2 customers each week, and take notes in an analysis-ready, living, breathing Google spreadsheet. When a customer conversation really inspires us, we share our notes, news feed style, in Slack.Once we begin to see themes, our co-founder, Heather McGough, does a full analysis across segments, allowing us to later be ready for synthesis; in other words, decide which content, tools and services we should test based on the needs of our community. It’s a low-touch process that keeps our customers close to our day-to-day operations. Think: It’s a lot like your check-in meetings with your boss, coupled with a semi-annual performance review. Only this time, your boss is your customer.Our biggest takeaway is that Conference speaker Charlie Scheinost, an engineering manager at Adobe, Extras: The Lean Startup Conference takes a full year to build out its annual program, but we test editorial concepts iteratively. By the time November hits, we’ll have published more than 50 blog posts, podcasts, and webcasts. The significance? These are all MVPs that lead up to our flagship conference.Through these content experiments, For another application of this idea, In 2014, the company faced one of the biggest opportunities in its existence: a pilot with Walmart. Mighty Handle had one shot to perfect its packaging, and couldn’t afford to take any chances. So what did Newton do? She ran a series of Facebook and YouTube ads to test concepts with Mighty Handle’s target audiences. This iterative approach helped her identify the right packaging for her target audience. Today, Mighty Handle In addition to the steps referenced above, we use multiple channels to sanity-check our assumptions. We run a post-registration survey to give every attendee the opportunity to express what they’re looking to learn, we engage with audiences on Twitter to find popular topics, and we host a live chat on our registration page.

I was at a dinner last night where an accomplished entrepreneur said the brand “didn’t matter.” I almost popped a blood vessel.He wasn’t referring to the brand, actually, just using the term indiscriminately to refer to what was really a kind of tagline. But it’s emblematic of an ignorance about the nature of brands that is stubbornly common in Boston. And if anything threatens to restore our second tier status, I believe it’s this.So what is a brand, to people who know better?As I If you do, and you want to do a better job building your brand to support your go-to-market effort, here’s what you need to do:I’ve spent my whole career thinking and learning about brands, and I’m still learning every day. Brands are as richly nuanced and as fascinating as the people they inhabit, so to be a student of branding is to be a student of human response.But if you don’t have time for that, and you just want to do something now to help advance the interests of your business on this dimension, do the above. It will at the very least provide you with a sensibility about brands that gives you an edge over the persistent corner of our community that just doesn’t get it. And it just might make the difference between Marketing guy, entrepreneur, lyrical gangsta. Actifio CMO, thoughts are my own.

Ideas, Products, Teams and Execution. Why start a startupHere are notes i took while listening to the first lesson of the Startup Class, taught by Sam Altman and Dustin Moskovitz.Y Combinator has funded 720 startups. 30% of advice is general, the rest is specific. This class aims to teach the 30%.Four areas of a startup: Idea, Product, Team, ExecutionOutcome =Idea x Product x Teams x Execution x Luck(random # between 0 and 10,000)Why Start a startup? Never start a startup for the sake of doing so. There are much easier ways to get rich. You should only start a startup if you feel compelled by a particular problem, and that starting a company is the best way to solve that problem. Passion for the problem comes first, a startup comes second.1. Recent conventional thinking is that the idea doesn’t matter. Almost like its uncool to think of an idea for a startup. Execution is usually 10x more important and harder than the idea, but execution is built ontop of a great idea. Great execution towards a terrible idea will get you nowhere. Most great companies start with a great idea, not a pivot. Most successful pivots are pivots towards something the founders themselves wanted. Airbnb happened cause Brian Chesky couldnt pay his rent, but he had some extra space.If your idea works out, your going to be working on this for a very long time. So it is worth some upfront time to think of the size and growth of the market, the defensability of the idea, and so on. Even though plans are worthless, the exercise of planning is very valuable and missing in most startups today. Long term thinking is a huge advantage in startups. The idea will expand and become more ambitious as you go. You want a nice kernel to start with. An important part of a good idea is that you need to build a business that is hard to replicate.The idea should come first, startup second. Wait till you come up with an idea you feel compelled to explore. The best comapnies are almost always mission oriented. To get everyone to work with a sense of purpose and work very hard, everyone has to feel like its an important mission. A great founding idea gives that mission. Takes 10 years to build a great startup. You have to believe that the mission matters.People outside the company will help you if its an important idea. Derivative companies, ones that build on top of existing ideas, aren’t mission driven, and don’t excite the people to work on it.The best ideas are often terrible at the beginning. The 13th search engine with no portal was, at the time, a bad idea. Portals were where the value was it. The 10th social network that was geared towards college students was a bad idea, especially when your competing with myspace and other sites with 100 million+ users. Most great companies start with a seemingly bad idea. If they were good ideas, most people would have already thought of it and done it.You want an idea that turns into a monopoly. An idea in a big market wont be a monopoly. You want an idea in a small market so you can quickly become a monopoly, and then expand. Bezos monopolized online book selling before selling everything else. If you come up with a crazy idea, most people will think its weird and bad. This is usually good. Another reason why its not really dangerous to tell people your idea, they think its crazy anyways.Most great companies take over small markets. Take the time to think about how markets will evolve. You want a market that is too small now for any big players to take a look at, but will be big in 10 years. This is one of the big systemic mistakes in investing. They think about the growth of the startup itself, not the growth of the market.One of the big advantages of the small but rapidly growing markets is that customers are usually desperate for a solution, and they will put up with an imperfect but rapidly growing product. Students generally have better intuition about which markets will grow rapidly than older people do. Students don’t really understand that you cannot create a market that doesn’t exist. This requires a lot of thinking to make sure the market will be there and will grow.Sequoia’s famous question. Why now? Why is now the best time to start this company. Why couldn’t it be done two years ago? Or why is starting it a few years from now too late? All great companies had great answers to this question. In general, its best to build something you yourself need. You understand the problem better than anyone and can build a first version quickly, without having to talk to customers. If you yourself don’t have the problem, your at a big disadvantage, so try to be as close to your customers.Good startup ideas are generally easy to explain and understand. More than a sentence or two is too complicated. Great ideas have to differ from existing companies in a distinct way. Googles search engine differed because it really worked, or new companies like SpaceX. Ideas that are derivatives of others, like the X for wine, or the Y for pets, usually fail.While you are as student, think about new ideas and meet potential cofounders. Quote by 50 cent:Broad definition: Anything involved in your customers interaction with what you build for them. Great Ideas turn to great product. One of the most important tasks of the founder is to make sure you build a really great product. When founders talk of their early days, they usually say sitting in front of a computer working on the product and talking to their customers. Nothing else. All other aspects, raising money, PR, hiring business development, etc, all become easier when you have a great product.Build something users love. Talk to users. Its better to build something that a small number of users love, than to build something that a large number of users like. Its much easier to expand from something that a small number of people love, than to expand on something that a lot of people just like. When starting a startup, this is the only thing you should care about, till its working. Then worry about other things. Its very easy to expand on a product that a few love. Very hard to expand on a product that many people like. There is so much on the internet, and so many products, that having users for simply “liking” the product will not cause it to achieve success.Find a small group of users, and get them to really love what your doing. When people really love something, they tell their friends about it. You get organic, word of mouth, growth when you have a small number of users love your product. Great companies always have a great product that spreads through word of mouth. Very few startups die because of competition. They die cause they fail to make their users love their product, and spend their time on other things. Start simple. Its hard to make a great product. Simple is good because it forces you to do one thing extremely well. Google had one web page with a text box and 2 buttons, and it return the best result.Founders are usually fanatical about their product. They get emails sent to their pagers so they wake up in the middle of the night to respond. They don’t ship crap. They feel physical pain when users complain about their product. You don’t need many users, you need to get users physically by hand and get them to give you feedback. Pinterest founder would go into apple stores and put the Pinterest homepage on the website so that way apple customers would see the site. He walked into coffee shops and begged people to sign on to his site. These things don’t scale. Thats exactly why it worked. Do things that don’t scale. Read Paul Grahams essay on it.Get your users manually. The goal is to get a small group of them to love your product. Understand that group extremely well, get extremely close to them, listen to them, and youll find out they are more than willing to give you feedback. Listen to outside users, and they will tell you what kind of product they will pay for.Great founders don’t put anyone between them and their users. The foudners do the sales and customer support. Keep metrics. Focus on ones that make the product better, and drive growth.Common reasons are money, flexibility, you be your own boss, its glamorous, bigger impact, etc.Fallacies of being a tech entrepreneur.There is an ugly side to being an entrepreneur. The reality is different than the media says. Its very stressful.Why is it so stressful? You have a lot of responsibility. The fear of failure is not just for yourself, but for other people who have devoted the best years of their life and their livelihood to following you. You are responsible for them, and for the opportunity cost of their time. Your always on call. If something comes up, you are going to deal with it.You are also a lot more committed. Being an employee of a company or a startup, you can just leave if things go bad. If you are founder, you are committed, even if things go sour.Most of the time CEOs spend their energy on problems other people bring to them, and its usually conflicts between people or conflicts in terms of where the company is heading, customers wanting different things, or a bad version of the product. CEOs decides “who do I disappoint the lease”Your always on call, no matter what time of the day. You are the role model of the company, you have to always be your best. If you pull your foot off the breaks, so does everyone else. You’re always working.Many times its better to join an existing company that you have analyzed to be a great company with a great idea and a great product. Employee #100 at dropbox now has $10M. Employee #100 at facebook is worth $200M, and even Employee #1000, joining Facebook in 2009, would be worth $10M today. These employees had both a big impact and a big financial reward.When it comes to maximizing impact, adding a late stage feature to an established company means you get a force multiplier. A company with a massive user base, an existing infrastructure, and working with an established team means that what you build will impact many many people.Brett Taylor came into google as Employee ~#1500, and created Google Maps. He got a big financial reward and made a huge impact. Justin Rosenstein, prototyped a chat integrated into gmail as a side project. Built the Like button on Facebook, which probably would’ve been very hard to build independently of Facebook. It is important to keep in mind the context for what kind of company you are trying to start and what kind of impact you will have, and if it is better to join an existing company to have a greater impact.You can’t not do it. You are super passionate about the idea and you know the problem very well. Not only is it an incredible idea, but you can build a great product around it that solves the problem for your small set of users and can monopolize a small market. You need that passion to get through the hard part. You need it to recruit, because candidates can tell if you don’t have passion. The world needs it, or perhaps the world needs you to work on something else. You know you have the right idea and the right passion when you leave work and spend all of your free time working on the project, its consuming all of your thoughts, and feel like you have to beat it out of your chest and give it to the world.learn. build. ship. iterate.Seeking intellect

I’m going to tell you a secret.It’s not a very big secret. You may already know it. In fact, if I tell you this secret and you don’t look at me after I tell you my secret and then say This secret doesn’t make you famous. It’s not glamourous. Even if you capitalize on this secret like a rockstar, you won’t ever become a household name. You won’t be able to afford a supercar, or a third home (but a second home would be nice). My secret is not a home run, it’s a base hit.Everybody wants to make a consumer app. Everybody wants to invest in a consumer app.Of all the hats that can be worn, we all share the consumer-hat.Everybody can relate to what everybody is from 5pm — 8am.I am a young guy. I haven’t spent too much time in corporate America. My evidence is anecdotal, and that I am pulling data from a small sample set.I like to work in ratios though, and of everybody I have sampled about this, I am pretty sure that I am getting a true/false ratio of over 90%.Usually each one of these ‘MASTER!’ spreadsheets has a person attached to them. That person is the MASTER’s slave. Cuz they are a slave to their ‘MASTER!!’. Get it?You can always identify the slaves because every once in a while you will find yourself on a conference call inquiring about some obscure business process and the person on the other line will stop you:And then Pete the poor slave jumps on the call and you play Candy Crush and Snapchat your friends until he is finished describing what the purple and green cells mean in his ‘MASTER!!!’ spreadsheet.I bring this up a lot. The most recent time I brought it up, my rant recipient happened to work at the mega-accounting firm; Ernst and Young.They, you know, do audits for giant corporations.Corporations that you have heard of, with national TV commercials and a 14.78B market cap.So my buddy, we’ll call him Matt, was telling me that they were doing an audit for one of these giant companies in the retail sector, and low and behold they came across a slave named ‘Wendy.’It was poor Wendy’s job to take all the returned items from last night [for this $15B retail company] and enter them in her spreadsheet one row at a time.When she was finished she would email the spreadsheet to the appropriate next person inside the organization. What happened next I can only guess, but I assume that person appended the total to another ‘MASTER!!!!’ spreadsheet.Look, I love spreadsheets. I prototype everything inside of them. Now that I can extend them using tools like Google Apps Script they are even better.But spreadsheets are flawed all-day baby, all-day.For one thing, visualizations suck. Data validation is rudimentary. The idea of user scope is non-existant. They don’t automate easily, and when they do the records are not permanent. They can’t handle large sets of data.No worries, that’s why we invented databases  webapps.You want to make money? Find a slave and free them from their ‘MASTER.’Says you.Nope. I’m talking about eliminating one of Wendy’s primary job functions.I have experience growing and managing teams, and one of the most interesting things I have learned is; people hate being treated like robots.Total shock, I know.Humans are actually pretty great at not being robots. They can reason, they are great at analytical thinking, they can calculate decisions with multiple variables astronomically fast.If you can change their work from being a robot doing data entry, to being a human doing data analysis, employee morale improves. When employee morale improves, employee productivity improves.Look at you. The catch for freeing the slaves, is that it can be really difficult to do customer development for your product.When you are building a consumer product, feedback is everywhere, but when you are killing inefficiencies in middle management, the feedback you need is very specific.All of the B2B consumer products are probably already taken. For example, all salespeople stood to benefit from nuking of the Rolodex. Then the SaaS model came, and there was a benefit to nuking the client (apps you install locally) CRM.And so now we have Salesforce.You don’t have to create Salesforce to buy a boat. You should be more focused. At least early on.The problem with being focused though, is that you are creating a product for a very specific person, usually within a very specific industry.If you don’t know The trouble is, you want as much feedback as possible. So you end up going around to consumers telling them about what you are working on. Muggles can’t help but give feedback.Just politely ignore it.The really tricky part is when you chat with somebody who is a consumer, but you can’t tell. Maybe somebody that’s just one industry away.Go ahead and gather their feedback. Then archive it. Once you are done springing everyone in your specific vertical you may want to move over to their vertical and free their slaves.But you have to put your own oxygen mask on first.Go beyond customer service. Get a job in middle management (easier said than done I know) and actually feel the pain.Put the chains on yourself for 6 months to a year. Are they heavy? Or are they bearable?

I’ve got news for you. Chances are your startup was going to fail even before you started reading this post, not because I said so, but because statistically most startups fail. Don’t let me get you down; it’s just the way it is in the sad, bedraggled business of startup-founding.So next time you’re sitting there, reading about the latest exit in TechCrunch as you listen to your lead develop proudly tell us about all the bugs he found on your back-end…. Consider this question:Can you describe your startup as “revolutionary?” If you can’t, you’re probably just spinning your wheels.I don’t mean to dissuade you. I probably don’t even know you yet I want you to succeed and I’m rooting for you. I want to help arm you for the struggle.At the risk of offending So be honest with yourself (to the extent someone drunk with ambition and blinded by confirmation bias can), and answer the following questions:1. If you’re one of the three or four people in this world with Internet access who have not yet watched 2. Is your Why/Belief strong and emotional enough to get other people excited? I’m talking about the people that will work for you, use your product and / or give you investment or revenue dollars. Does it give you or them goose bumps? (I have to tell you that I literally get goose bumps when I talk about my portfolio companies, and I love and relish that feeling. People don’t always agree with the Why/Belief, but that’s par for the course — not everyone believes in a revolution, there will always be a status quo.)3. Are the people who work for you, or will work for you, motivated purely by the lure of financial gain, or are they “bought in” to your venture’s Why/Belief? If the former, things will be tough. If the latter — well, things will also be tough, because startups are tough. But at least you’ll have people alongside you whose shared belief carries them, and you, (hopefully) through those tough times.4. Can you identify the object of your revolution — the villain? It may be sucky competition who doesn’t understand your target market’s pain. It may be your target market’s own malaise or naiveté and their unwillingness to try new things, that you need to overcome. But I guarantee you’ll need to fight, battle, overcome something — do you know what it is and how to defeat it? (You know what, Harvard Business Review? These battle metaphors really are useful…) If you haven’t seen this one either, watch 5. Is your solution sufficiently different than any other direct or indirect method of dealing with your target issue? You want to get to a position where you can answer these questions positively, where you get goose bumps when you describe the Why? and the villain in your startup’s narrative, to employees, customers, partners and investors.Not everyone will feel what you feel or believe what you believe; that’s what revolutions are about. But trust me, those goose bumps will keep you going when other things fail.

We may be very good at creating our startups in our own countries. We may aspire to cross physical borders with them. But we assume that unless we have serious connections, an ability to pitch, and networking know-how, it will be close to impossible. A couple of the speakers at Leancamp Sofia, held recently, would disagree though. The trick for the international relations we would all aspire to have, according to But it will never happen if you do not get to know the person really well. One of the greatest things you can do with relations such as that is “to pay some social capital forward” — connect them with someone you believe they should know and talk with. That would ultimately create the non transactional nature of your relationship and build the deeper trust.The trick for him lies a lot less on chance and a lot more on a thorough investigation about the people that could be helpful. It is easy coming up with one, two or even three but what about twenty or a hundred potential connections. It takes research and knowing what you want, which usually proves helpful in itself. “People constantly ask me for a connection with someone without specifying why or of what good that connection would be to them. I usually reply saying: how about you send me a list other people that could be as good, and quickly describe why you need to know each of those people.”He wants them to do the mental exercise and leap to realize just how many people are hidden in Linkedin, Crunchbase, or alumni groups. All they have to do is look rather than rely on the obvious choices. Probabilistically, this larger amount of people also increases the chances of a connection actually happening and being helpful.Max encourages startups to invest a few hours in research, making a list of 100 desired connections. Some startups here are starting to call this the Max 100. (Update: For one, selling yourself or your business to someone is only possible if you put yourself on the same level as the other person. The weaker connections, the people standing at the edges, are easier to talk to and easier to impress.Telling the weaker links the right kind of story nonchalantly can transport you to the heart of the desired social network much faster, as Lino, one of the curators of Leancamp, has learned not that long ago in Ireland.What should your story be? “It should be something interesting and worth retelling,” Lino says. Instead of telling people about your product, tell them a story that they can later tell to someone else referencing you. To create stories like that the easier thing would be to create interesting things about yourself — help people figure out how to present themselves in 160 characters as Vesselina does with ===hunter of human stories. hunt me back on Twitter How it really works.

Y te diré porque.Como Lead Designer en Hablo del diseño, pero quiero hablar de un espectro más amplio que el de solo branding, diseño de interfaz o de imágenes para Facebook, hablo del espectro de un buen Lo que tú estas creando es un producto, una marca, algo con lo lo que la gente debe identificarse, sentirse cómodo, único, diferente. Para explicar mejor este punto veamos este vídeo:El video para Dollar Shave Club ejemplifica esto, una idea quizás simple, burda y aburrida puede venderse de una manera innovadora, creando una experiencia disfrutable y con personalidad.Tu startup es buena, tu idea tiene potencial pero simplemente no lo está comunicando, es confusa y difícil de utilizar para el usuario o incluso se siente como un producto que está incompleto.Pero ¿Cómo puedes cambiar esto? Invirtiendo en diseño, claro está.El diseño en startups es más que imprescindible, no un lujo, es la necesidad más básica de todas. La de la comunicación.Vivimos en un mundo de apariencias y experiencias, tu startup puede tener funcionalidades y algoritmos únicos, pero si no sabes transmitir esto o el usuario no sabe entenderlo, lo siento, no funcionará (o por lo menos tardará un poco más).Cuando hablo de diseño, me refiero a aspectos que van desde la buena comunicación de tu marca hacía los usuarios mediante un buen branding que pueda transmitir sentimientos, vivencias y experiencias.Por otro lado se encuentra el diseño de interfaces, las cuáles mas allá de lo “bonito” que puedan verse, de las animaciones o colores que se utilicen deben resolver la necesidad de hacer mas fácil al usuario el utilizar un feature especifico, de hacerlo más rápido y sencillo.El diseño del producto también tiene que ver con la selección de flujos óptimos, la elección de que features son importantes y cuales no para la buena experiencia y comprensión de tu proyecto. El cómo el usuario va interactuar y reaccionar a este feature. Diseñar también tene que ver con el funcionamiento de las cosas.Por último el diseño de una experiencia que abrace al usuario, que genere un sistema de pertenencia ante un público, que lo haga sentir parte de una comunidad, al final, tu proyecto es lo que es gracias a los usuarios, no al revés.Prestar la atención debida al área de diseño y comunicación puede ayudar a tu startup o idea a ser entendida y adoptada de una forma mas fácil.Muy pocas personas bajan o utilizan aplicaciones que se ven mal, que tienen colores que no combinan, que tienen iconos pixeleleados, que usan 10 tipografías diferentes o que no tienen nada que lo identifique.Invierte en diseño, en comunicación, en una experiencia que deje un buen sabor de boca, que enamore tanto visual como conceptualmente.Lead Designer en Sígueme en Design student.

You’ve often heard it being said “find a need and provide a solution for it” as the secret sauce for developing great products.It’s true.One of the best ways to change the world is to find a need and solve it.When you study some of the great innovators through out all the ages, they often set out to identify problems, challenges, pain-points experienced by either themselves or other people. They then innovated solutions that solved those particular problems in return of a reward such as money or recognition.The same formula works today. At least it works for me. I always set out to solve a personal problem and discover than there are thousands of other people with the same challenge. But for African entrepreneurs specifically those in the African Tech industry, there are loopholes to this theory.But to keep track of content they posted, we also created a news reader which is what you’ll experience on the product’s home page. This reader curates headlines of the latest stories posted by bloggers and media houses in Uganda. And we are not done yet. Storipot is an on-going effort to make local content easily dicoverable and consumed. You can read more on However, while we have might have made significant strides in organizing the digital content space in Uganda, we face external forces bigger than ourselves.Twitter and Facebook often bundled as “social media” have become the default standard for finding content anyway in Africa.Online users no longer type in website addresses of publishers’ sites to access the latest information.Online users expect news to find them on their twitter stream or Facebook Newsfeed. If your content doesn’t hit their individual streams, then you’ve forever lost those users. And with Facebook’s organic reach of less than 5% of your total Facebook fan-base, contrary to popular opinion, it’s even becoming harder to distribute and find local content. Anyone who runs a Facebook page knows that very well.While Storipot could have helped with the distribution of local content, we discover that users would rather stay on their newsfeed (sometimes for free thanks to Facebook Zero) rather than visit Storipot.com to find local content. In essence, we are coming to a realization that we are in fact solving a need that Facebook already solved — finding local content.Isn’t this a common scenario faced by most African products?It is.What need are you going to solve that hasn’t already been solved by global giants? Search? There’s Google. Productivity and Word processing? There’s MS Office. Communication? There’s Gmail, Whatsapp, Twitter and several local telecoms. Accounting and Finance? There’s Quickbooks. Social networking? There’s Facebook and Twitter. E-commerce? Well, there’s no Amazon in Africa, but you’ll to build the physical infrastructure that would make E-commerce work in Africa(more on this later). Plus, if there’s something I’ve left out, simply visit Github, SourceForge, Google Code, Stackoverflow for free source code of whatever need you want to solve.Mxit, South African-born Whatsapp before Whatsapp ran smoothly on feature phones such as Nokias and smartphones like Blackberry. When it was at its best, Mxit is rumored to have had over 1 millions users actively using its revolutionary messaging platform. However, the coming of Silicon Valley-backed Whatsapp spelt the end of Africa’s social and messaging platform.Even well-funded products struggle against the big shots for those of you always complaining about lack of VC support in Africa. Ugandan-born Billionaire Ashish Thakkar has There have been only a handful of locally-brewed products that have made it. That’s not predominantly because they solved a need. It’s because they solved a local need that was outside of the jurisdiction of any of the Silicon Valley big-shots either because of market conditions or local regulatory landscape.A good example that’s often quoted is Safaricom’s M-Pesa, the posterchild of mobile money transactions. The mobile telecom roll-out mobile financial services on it’s own GSM cellular network which was outside of the global internet that’s dominated by Silicon Valley companies.In essence Safaricom was and still is the only bull in the kraal. The same model has been used by MTN Group, Airtel among other mobile Telecoms operating in African markets.This explains why Mobile Money hasn’t been successful in other emerging markets where regulatory bodies put stringent measures for mobile telecoms to roll out their Mobile money products.Another good example is the success of dual-sim smartphones in Africa by the likes of Tecno, Infinix etc.I’veYet another case is Rocket internet online companies in Africa. Under the Africa Internet Holding (AIH), rocket internet has mastered the art of duplicating products that have worked in the west in emerging markets.But rocket internet isn’t simply a photocopying machines as many Tech media sites would like to think. Instead Rocket is strategically rolling out only products that the Silicon Valley big shots haven’t been able to effectively do in Africa.For instance, we know Rocket for being an e-commerce behemoth in Africa. It runs Jumia which is literally Africa’s biggest online mall. Kaymu which is an eBay of sorts without auctioning, Vendito which is a Craig’s List, HelloFood, an online food ordering service, Everjobs which is a job searching site among several others.Why haven’t they done a “Facebook for Africa”? Maybe a “Google for Africa” or perhaps another “Whatsapp for Africa”? Why E-commerce?If you’ve been following my arguments up until this point, the reasons are obvious. Rocket doesn’t want to cross the path of western internet giants because it knows very well the end result of that futile attempt. It will miserably loose like most African startups have.Instead Rocket is interested in E-commerce because for starters trade is local. Amazon doesn’t work in Uganda because the infrastructure for Amazon to work here doesn’t yet exist — at all. I’ve personally found it a challenge to shop anything from Amazon. One needs aOnly a handful of banks in Uganda do offer that service making online shopping almost impossible. Then there’s shipping a product from a vendor on Amazon (who’s most likely in the US) to Uganda. The shipping charges could be 5 times the cost of the actual product. So who’s going to shop from Amazon in their right mind?Knowing very well that Africa is outside of Amazon’s turf, Rocket is unrelenting investing in online shopping internet sites. The biggest one is Jumia which is currently in over 12 countries. I’ve shopped with Jumia Uganda. It’s the best, most fluid, painless and convenient shopping experience I’ve had.The offline world in the most parts of Africa is a mess. I live in Uganda and I experience the pains of broken systems on a daily. You should probably read my post on Done? Good.Most of Africa leap-leapfrogged postal system thanks to mobile wireless telephony. While that might have made communication affordable and accessible to all, it left physical addressing system undeveloped.Rocket internet is now paying for that.While Jumia might have my physical address in their database, it’s a complete illusion. Delivering products to my doorstep involves a long string of calls between myself and the delivery man sometimes at my expense. I’ve to direct the delivery guy to my location via phone calls. If I posted a recorded conversation, it wouldn’t be anything short of being hilarious.Rocket internet is currently incurring heavy operational costs in logistics, delivery while keeping the price of products down in order to keep customers happy. Costs that very little local startups arecapable to bare without serious Series A funding from a VC.If you’re not Rocket internet, does this mean the end of your dreams. Is this the end of innovation for local startups? Can we just throw in the towel.Of course not.Brutal as it may be, the internet presents endless opportunities even for local startups. Even in a big ocean, there are big and small fish co-existing in the same ecosystem.Internet entrepreneurs like Jason Njoku, co-founder of iRokoTV, a Video-on-demand service for Nollywood content is proof that you can dance alongside Youtube, iTunes or Netflix.Ugandans for instance including myself are big fans of Nollywood movies locally known as “Ki-Nigeria”.Another person to comes to mind is Seun Osewa, the founder of Nairaland.com. You could call it the “Facebook of Nigeria”. Nairaland was started around 2005/6, just about the time that Zuck was rolling out his social network. FB hadn’t caught up yet which gave Nairaland time and space to become the ultimate online destination to find local content and connect with other Nigerians.Unfortunately, success stories across the continent are still limited. The hassle is real. But we must not give up. I find the internet the most interesting, invigorating, scalable space to innovate and build stuff.Writer. Coder. Uncle!

At least the first one.I’ve been blogging for more than 20 years, and I’ve used almost anything there is to publish articles on the Web: from a bunch of scripts using SGMLTools to generate my very first posts from SGML, to phpSlash when Slashdot was the coolest thing around, to ezPublish, to Joomla, to Drupal, to Wordpress, to Tumblr, to Blogger, to Jekyll, to Ghost, to Known, to my own bucket3. I mean I’ve setup, modified, hacked, created plugins, used or at least tested probably every popular blogging platform and then some.I like trying new blogging services and software, messing around, moving my posts from one platform to the other, trying templates and features and then debating technical, business and even philosophical issues realated to each platform. It’s my hobby. I take satisfaction spending my spare time like this.But when it comes to your recently launched startup, well, that’s a different story: The last thing you want is spending your precious time trying, setting up, customising and managing your company’s blog. Arguably, one of the best. The editing tool is amazing: easy to use, clean, inspiring. It integrates smoothly with Facebook and Twitter. It makes it extremely easy to ask people you trust to review your articles before you publish them.In addition to Facebook and Twitter sharing, Medium is it’s own social networking platform. Whenever a user likes, highlights or comments on an article, this becomes visible to their Medium followers. It also makes it extremely easy for a first-time visitor to follow you and your blog.And Not to mention the Medium app for iOS/Android that will notify your followers whenever you post a new article.You have a tech startup. And you are blogging to reach your stake holders: prospects, influential bloggers, investors, tech journalists. I don’t have the numbers to prove it, but in my experience, a significant percentage of them are already on Medium and publishing your content there incleases the probablitity they’ll read it.If I launched a startup today, I’d And if everything went well, and my company grew and we found product/market fit, then, maybe, I would reconsider moving the blog to an other platform that allows for more customisation and integration — but only then.Dad, geek, entrepreneur.

10x, as in “10x Engineer,” is a well-trod expression used to suggest there are classes of people who are so much better than average that the results you get from them are an order of magnitude higher. There’s appropriate debate around whether the concept is true enough to turn into a hiring principle and if the concept celebrates the individual at the expense of the team. Hold that aside because I’m not addressing that here. Instead I want to comment on what a “10x Angel” looks like — the type of individual investor who delivers value to the startup in ways that are notably different than the average funder.One reason Satya and I thought we had Product Market Fit for starting Similarly I was exposed to — and continue to see — what I’d call 0x Angels - people who write a check and then actually erode value. Avoid these folks. You can reference check angels just like you would VCs or employees. If you just need the money, stick unknown angels in an AngelList Syndicate so they have more limited information rights.0x Angels forward every TechCrunch article about a competitor to the founder with note “Should we be worried?” or “What’s your take on this?” (and then get offended when there’s not an immediate lengthy response)10x Angels gather info about the market from non-media sources and only contact the team when it’s actionable, such as “Hey, this PhD was talking about you guys on his blog. Seems like he might be interested in working for you guys.” or “A buddy told me Competitor A is talking with Google about an acquisition. His info is usually pretty reliable. You hear anything similar?”0x Angels disappear in the tough times, not wanting to be associated with something that isn’t yet a winner.10x Angels deliver clear feedback and set expectations for how they can, or can’t, help when companies are struggling. They’re willing to spend more time than their ownership % might warrant. This doesn’t mean they tolerate bad behavior or throw good time after bad forever, but they remember they invested in the people. And relationships are long term equities.0x Angels love to talk about their success on social media, making it about them, not the company.10x Angels also promote enthusiastically but are careful with their pronouns. “We” didn’t build an amazing company. They did.0x Angels request advisor shares if they’re asked to make an introduction to someone they know. Or when an exciting A Round may “dilute” them (no, you own less of something much bigger. That’s a good thing.)10x Angels know that making an investment comes with some commitment of elbow grease and try to be upfront about these expectations with the founders. If the founders want to meaningfully increase that amount of work ongoing, 10x Angels have open conversations about whether they can assist and if so, how to make meaningfully valuable. Or they suggest advisors, contractors or potential hires that might have more time.0x Angels don’t use bcc10x Angels take long emails offline because face-to-face is easier to collaborate, solve problems, etc than a founderinvestors chain letterAny other differences you’ve seen between 10x Angels and 0x Angels?Funding exciting startups via 

Money’s been flowing. VCs have been investing money at levels not seen since the bubble year of 2000. Entrepreneurs have been raising enormous amounts of money at valuations that assume years of future growth and eventual profitability. So what’s the downside of all this? That entrepreneurs mistake what they’re reading on Techcrunch as the reality for their own companies both now and for the foreseeable future. Raising money seems like a cakewalk, but that’s only because you don’t read about the failed financings, down rounds and recaps nearly as much as the unicorns and decacorns. And warning signs are emerging that the cascade of cash is Raising large amounts of money has been glorified. Being able to do it quickly and painlessly has become the expectation. But the reality is very different and likely to become more so as the market adjusts to a reality with few exits and difficult to justify valuations. So just remember that at the end of the day, only two things matter when it comes to fundraising. Put money in the bank and maintain optionality. Give yourself the ability to control your startup’s destiny and take on more risk only when you feel ready.Dad, product guy, ex-Twitter/Google/VC, foodie,

We’re very happy to now learn that the following new Portuguese startups that joined the Last year, 4 companies out of Following this announcement, I wanted to personally express my joy in knowing that Seedcamp invested in 3 more of our Portuguese companies.We’re in the business of supporting startups and providing them with a hub where they can exchange experiences and startup know-how. We want to provide them with the platform where they can not only learn from mentors, but also learn to help one another. Something which was previously not very common in Portugal.Following the second year Seedcamp showed their love to our startups, I wanted to describe in detail why I believe this pattern is sustained by the great job Portugal is doing to push entrepreneurship.It is refreshing to know that Portugal, a relatively small European country, now has a number of startups which are emerging in the European Startup scene. Considering the tough economic situation our country currently finds itself in, it is great to see this positive shift of mindset.Given that Seedcamp is famous for selecting that “1%”” of European Startups, how did Portugal provide so many promising startups in such little time?I believe there are a few reasons that make the ingredients for success.For one, we have great engineering talent supported by Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade do Minho and Universidade do Porto. Not only good research, but also very qualified and inquisitive engineers are formed here. We’re also seeing a paradigm shift: instead of pushing all engineers into consulting jobs (which is what still happens to 90%), some individuals try to create their companies. Our work at Startup Lisboa supports this, by giving them space to flourish and blossom.The cost of living makes for cost-effective business model validation and inexpensive operations. You can rent a house for €400 and live comfortably (the reason why we have so many foreign entrepreneurs living here). This reflects also on the salaries; a salary of an engineer is a fifth of the price of an engineer in San Francisco, without paying the price of low code quality (which is what you get when outsourcing to more traditional outsourcing partners further East). This enables you to create an inexpensive, but very qualified company that provides quality work that can compete worldwide.Another success factor is Startup Lisboa. Startup Lisboa is a state/private-funded incubator which houses the majority of the most promising startups in Lisbon. It’s the highest density startup incubator in Europe. All of the current Seedcamp companies have their offices here, just footsteps from one another, which allows them to share and grow together. We’ve created more than 250 jobs in the last 1.5 years. We’ve opened and requalified 2 buildings and we’ve just been granted another one, to fill it with startups. Our work is not only providing credibility to startups but also supporting them through value-added mentoring as well as opening doors for business partnership and expansion plans.As an incubator, our aim is to provide our entrepreneurs with office space at reasonable rents as well as a support structure, to maximize their chances for success. We do not charge them any additional money to be part of our family and we do not take any equity either. We are about providing a platform for entrepreneurs to think big and think global. Portugal serves as a great place to test an idea or a product, but we encourage founders to think beyond Portuguese borders and the connection with Seedcamp has helped us make this a reality for Portuguese startups. Companies like SimpleTax, which started in Portugal, now have a team in London. Portugal and Startup Lisboa are slowly positioning themselves as focal point of entrepreneurship and disruption. We will continue to serve startups and we want to hear from yours. From our side, we are looking forward to collaborate with Seedcamp. We’ve learned immensely and we’re just starting. On behalf of Startup Lisboa and the city of Lisbon, Seedcamp will always be a priority and will always be able to count with our support. Startup Lisboa is proud to build that bridge to Europe’s leading Early-Stage Tech Accelerator.We’re proud and we’re enriched today. And we’re just starting.Joao VasconcelosMentorship-driven seed stage incubator for web and software startups

As a principal analyst for a There is, of course, an abundance of “me-too’s.” How often have I heard this:Or this:But there are plenty of gems too. I remember my first conversation with the founders of Airbnb, I think back in 2010, when it probably wasn’t much more than three guys in a room.But even in the case of some of the most obvious “me too’s”, I can’t help but feel some admiration. It’s no small thing to take such a risk in a crowded and relentlessly competitive industry like travel.Over the years we have seen so many startups, so we decided to dig into the numbers to see what we could learn about the state of startups in travel: where are entrepreneurs investing their creative capital, and where are investors placing their bets?First, we set a few parameters: companies had to be founded between 2005-2013, and they had to be focused on travel and digital. And they had to be real. We had to see a real product or at least have some credible and verifiable backing. In other words, there had to be a little more than a couple of developers in a garage, or a fancy pitch deck.We ended up including almost 750 travel startups. Combined, those companies raised approximately US$4.8 billion over the eight-year period. That includes angel, venture and later-stage investments as well as strategic acquisitions. We excluded IPOs.Has the market been pretty hot? Well, the majority of that funding happened in just the last three years — more than $3.3 billion. This was led by some bigger deals with companies such as Trivago, Airbnb, Lyft, Uber and China’s Qunar, eHi Car Rental and Kuaidadi (it excludes the monster rounds raised by Airbnb and Uber in 2014).You could argue that ride-sharing and taxi-hailing services such as Kuaidadi, Lyft and Uber are not so much in travel as they are in local transportation. If we exclude them, a majority of the total funding would still have occurred within the last three years.One of the most exciting developments is the growth in startups coming from outside the U.S. and Europe. From 2011 to 2013, 30% of travel startups were founded in emerging market regions, but Asia — led by China — is driving most of that growth, not surprisingly.Travel really isn’t an industry so much as an umbrella term housing a range of industries. This includes everything from big global airlines and hotel brands to online travel agencies, mom-and-pop tour operators and the growing ranks of sharing economy participants listing homes on Airbnb and HomeAway, or offering local experiences through services like Vayable and EatWith. We sought to identify areas within travel that are generating the most significant interest from investors and entrepreneurs. So we undertook the painstaking task of manually reviewing and tagging each startup in two ways:Not surprisingly, lodging rules (see Figure 2 below). Lodging is the largest global travel industry segment (if you include all forms of lodging), and its relatively large margins drive the majority of industry profits for online agencies and other intermediaries. The 243 lodging-focused travel startups established between 2005 and 2013 collectively raised nearly $1.2 billion.But more telling than the total funding or number of companies is the average funding per company (the green line in Figure 2, which correlates to the secondary Y axis on the right). This gives an indication of where both entrepreneurs and investors see the biggest opportunities, or where there might be a mismatch. Ground transportation — which includes the many ride-sharing and taxi hailing apps as well as startups focused on car rental, bus and rail — has the highest funding per company. (Note: we have excluded a handful of companies, such as Airbnb, eHi Car Rental, HomeAway and Uber, whose total funding has been so large that it would skew the category averages.)One interesting vertical category is “inspiration,” second from the right in Figure 2. We created this for the many travel startups focused not so much on a single traditional vertical, such as flights or hotels, but rather on the broader activity of trip planning, discovery and inspiration. This includes social travel startups, trip organizers, mobile content guides and other services. This category may be the second largest after lodging (nearly 200 companies), but it has one of the lowest per-company funding averages. While a lot of entrepreneurs see opportunity in the inspiration and travel planning phase of travel, investors aren’t buying in.We also analyzed startups by their commercial or technical area of focus. In other words, is their horizontal focus transactional (bookings), mobile, social media, advertising, etc. There is definitely some overlap here, as well as some subjectivity to the categorization. (For example, what defines a “mobile” travel startup, when virtually every travel company today must have a mobile play.) So we took pains to designate companies to a horizontal according to their core strategic focus. For example, Airbnb has a great mobile experience, but mobile is not their mission; it’s creating a peer-to-peer marketplace for lodging (and likely other related services in the future). So we tagged Airbnb as peer-to-peer, not mobile. Hotel Tonight is about mobile-only last-minute hotel bookings (you can only book a “Hotel Tonight” on mobile), so they are tagged for mobile.The biggest horizontal category is, not surprisingly, booking (see Figure 3 below). The transaction is where the revenue is, and many of these startups are companies bringing online transactional services into new markets. Those could be new geographies, such as Latin America or Russia, or new verticals, such as vacation rentals or local events and activities, where there have been limited online booking and payment options for travelers.Again the green line (average funding per company in each horizontal) is telling. The largest sectors on a per capita funding basis are peer-to-peer, advertising and data and analytics. Social/UGC is the second largest focus area for travel startups — a lot of entrepreneurs are trying to create the next TripAdvisor or Facebook for travel — but investors seem to have decided there already is a Facebook for travel (it’s called Facebook).The sharing economy is definitely having its day in the sun. Among the more than 90 peer-to-peer companies, there are two dominant vertical categories: lodging and ground transportation. The lodging peer-to-peer category includes Airbnb, HomeAway and their myriad imitators, while ground transportation includes the well-known ride-sharing services as well as car rental plays such as FlightCar and RelayRides.A third interesting category is in-destination tours and activities, where startups such as Vayable and Withlocals are creating marketplaces for local residents to become local guides. While this latter category is home to a number of startups, it accounts for just a sliver of travel’s peer-to-peer funding pie.The big question for these nearly 750 startups is, how many have been successful? Of course, that depends on the definition of success. There have certainly been a few eye-popping exits, such as HomeAway, KAYAK, Qunar, trivago and Tuniu. There have been some incredible rounds of funding, including Airbnb, HomeAway, Uber, Lyft, eHi, Kuaidadi and Wimdu.But when it comes to acquisitions, the numbers are pretty small. Fewer than one in 10 companies have been acquired. And many of those acquisitions were not the big exits their founders (and investors) likely hoped for, but distressed asset sales or “acqui-hires” for developer talent.However, the good news is that only one in five of those companies has closed. The majority are still working toward that next round, trying to hit profitability (if they haven’t already), and still striving for that dreamed-of acquisition or IPO.At PhoCusWright we have done much more analysis and have detailed information on all of the 750 or so companies. We have invested a lot of analyst time and effort into this work, so we do charge for it.

I’ve been on the founding team of quite a few other successful B2B startups.Consumer Internet startups that I have invested in or Capital Factory has incubated:Austin is no stranger to consumer Internet success.I frequently visit Silicon Valley and New York City. I’m in each city a few times a year and have many friends and colleagues there. When I raised angel funding for OtherInbox, about 1/3 of my investors were from Silicon Valley and 1/3 from New York City.On my last trip to San Francisco, I met with Naval Ravikant from AngelList and Mike Maples, Jr. from Floodgate, two of the most well respected and successful seed investors in the world. Naval believes that through AngelList startups all over the world can attract funding from anywhere in the world. While Silicon Valley has its advantages, I think he would agree that AngelList and crowdfunding will continue to make it easier for any kind of startup to raise money from anywhere. Mike wants to see a great consumer Internet company come out of Austin and is waiting with his checkbook open and ready to fund it.It’s just not true that Austin investors won’t do consumer Internet deals.Most of the people I hear complaining about this have not created a successful company and aren’t investors. Foreca.st was one of the consumer Internet startups we incubated at Capital Factory. I shared Ordoro’s profile on AngelList and connected them with I’m not saying Investors don’t bring other value — I certainly believe in value-add investors. But the money will have less and less leverage over time for technology businesses. More and more businesses will be able to be started without investors.Crowdfunding, AngelList Syndicates and other alternative investment tools coming down the pipe will give you more and more options.I don’t think it’s true that Consumer Internet startups can’t get funded in Austin. But even if it were true, I don’t think it’s productive to whine about it. You re-inforce it by saying it over and over and make it harder on yourself.Before the end of the year I signed the paperwork to invest in Austinpreneur. Husband, father, music lover. I help people quit their jobs and become entrepreneurs.

A startup is a learning experience and pivots are inevitable. So it should be no surprise that photo sharing app Instagram started out as a check-in app, or that Slack spun out of Tiny Speck, a gaming startup, and Paypal started life as a way to Pivots are an important part of the startup lifecycle, that’s why so many great products have spawned out of them. But there’s another important part of the startup lifecycle that, if properly employed, can either reduce the likelihood of a massive pivot, or get you to the inflection point sooner, saving both time and money.Startups rarely set out on a path to product market fit. Instead they must always be willing to examine their current trajectory and alter the course as needed. The longer you head down the wrong path, the harder it is to pivot away from it later. This is why, like the plane flying from California to Alaska, pivoting more often in smaller ways often gets you to your destination quicker.Validation helps correct your course. If you aren’t properly validating at every step, you could be heading further and further from where you’re trying to go.Talking to your customers daily can help you keep your finger on the pulse of your product so that you can always be sure you’re making something that is actually satisfying their needs.

There are a ton of great services with dead simple integrations, it’s really just about deciding what you want to track. I recommend being fairly liberal here, you can always remove a tracking event if it proves not to be very useful. Here are a few great services you can use to track your events:A founder friend recently told me about monthly meetings that her and her co-founder have, in which they discuss where the business is and if their previous assumptions still seem to be true. I love this technique because it ensures that you are always being opened minded about where the business is and whether or not your experiments are working. Discussions like this can often be the catalyst for a pivot, one which might make or break your business.Building a business is about accepting that you are going to make some big mistakes, but hopefully by keeping product validation at the top of your mind, you can avoid a few of them.For now, always be scrutinizing, always be validating.Co-founder of 

From Stanford’s CS183B Course Like so many others, I was excited when I first heard that YC was going to make the lectures from Earlier this evening I sat down to and started watching Sam Altman kick things off with the subject of Startup Ideas. To help myself retain some of the information, I decided to go through it slowly, while taking some notes along the way. I quickly found that the majority of my notes were basically quotes taken verbatim from the lecture. As a result, I decided to trim my notes down to quotes from Sam Altman, all 140 characters or less, and share them here for fellow startup enthusiasts to read and share.I plan on going through the rest of the lecture and posting additional notes shortly. In addition, I plan on doing the same for the upcoming lectures as well. If you feel there are any additional quotes you would like me to add, feel free to comment and I’ll be sure to add them in.If you found this list useful, check out my post on the second part of this lecture: “Also, you can follow me on Twitter Image Credit: A collection of Quotes from Each Lecture

Startups often wonder why investors can’t see how viral they’re going to get.I met an entrepreneur yesterday who confidently stated that his product was going to grow ‘virally’ because it was the best in its category. That was essentially the optimism that powered the growth slide in his investor deck. (To see why this is wrong at many levels, read point 2 below, but more on that later)The problem: Investors weren’t buying this pitch of his yet.Why don’t investors get it?Frankly, too many startups out there have claimed that they will grow virally and too few actually have. Here are the top three reasons why a startup’s claim to going viral may not be well-founded.Imagine this! You don’t have a clue how you’re going to get users. There’s an empty slide in your deck reading user acquisition, which follows the slide showing hockey stick adoption.The solution? We’ll grow virally! Three words that fill up the slide nicely.This may sound naive but investors have seen so many startups use this route that they automatically clam up when someone presents virality as the only source of user acquisition.The second problem with this is as follows: Virality is users bringing in other users. For that, you need some users on the product in the first place. Hence, virality can only work in tandem with other user acquisition models, which bring in users, who then bring in other users. Relying on virality as a standalone source of user acquisition is fatally flawed to begin with.So here’s one of the biggest problems with entrepreneurs claiming their startup is going to go viral. Often, they don’t understand what virality is in the first place.Virality and Word of Mouth are two concepts that are often conflated and confused.Word of Mouth is what happens when people love your product so much, they just can’t stop talking about it. Word of Mouth is driven by your ability to deliver customer delight and your ability to convert users into fans. It’s largely an art, and one that you can’t necessarily structure or control. You can maximize the chances of generating WOM by delighting your users but you can’t force them to start talking about it.Word of Mouth works effectively for online as well as offline products. Virality works only for networked businesses, and hence, largely for online businesses. Users need to be connected to each other for them to spread the word about a product during the course of product usage.Investors like products that have organic virality of the kind shown above. Products that spread with usage are ideal for venture scale returns. Hotmail, Surveymonkey, Paypal, Skype, KickStarter, YouTube and Instagram are all examples of such products that have performed extremely well.Organic virality is Word of Mouth can’t be designed. But it can definitely be forced and/or manipulated.This notion continues to exist even though The problem is compounded with an obsession with optimizing virality by maximizing ‘k’, the viral factor. If your viral loop itself is leading to spam, maximizing ‘k’ will make the spam problem even worse. We’ve seen this play out with Branchout and Skillpages, and with countless games.More at Exploring the disruption caused by online and mobile platforms

The 20th of December.I came up with the idea that Medium has quite the same structure of distributing knowledge as I* implement:This simple division describes the structure of the course that consists of atomic lessons. By atomic I mean one lesson covers one piece of knowledge.There are some assumptions for courses/collections that work both in education and Medium:These 3 assumptions that were laid in Medium were also our basic thoughts on how to organize the new educational stronghold:Taking into considerations that Medium’s and ours starting points have the same directions I decided to keep on researching how I started to analyze the architecture of Medium — what is presented to users first, how to get to the smallest item (story) from the main page, what are the one-click-access, two-click-access and three-click-access elements, etc — and created some initial screen flows.The main page of Medium contains a header, a list of posts with 3 range options and a footer with 3 links. The header itself has a menu button which is a logo, a big picture, one call-to-action button “New Story”, the site’s name and its motto.The selections of elements on the main page tells about Medium’s orientation on content.Looking at the content through the lens of education: collections = courses and posts = lessons. And here’s a question. Why do course-providers hide the content on their pages?So the challenge is to change the attitude of course-providers and learners towards the content. And implement best practices of Therefore the orientation of content implies not only collections (courses), but also items (posts on Medium, applications on App Store, lessons on Stepic) to be presented on the main page.On the sketch above both courses and lessons are shown.The “Top courses” block contains the carousel where a current banner shows the most required information.This banner’s elements:Talking about collections of stories on Medium one thing is worth noticing — Medium is still about content. There is a list of stories with good spacing between and only necessary details. Stories are possible to range by 3 options as ones on the main page.And the list is headed with a short description, a big picture which is also a collection’s avatar, and a number of collection followers.There’re special collections as well with advanced characteristics.Anyway the goal of the collection is to give the content to users keeping The problem is in providing the fast access to lessons from the course page. Rearranging tabs and starting not from announcements, but from lessons’ lists is an option.Nevertheless, two clicks yet is more than one click.The initial Stepic’s vision of tile-presentation of content fits Medium’s idea of one-click-access from the collection page.One-click-access to items. Check.White space. Check.One direction to consume content. Check. And possible to change the direction (by date or by order) keeping it single. Check.Chapters and numeration. Check.Clear. Simple. Swiss design. Check. Check. Check.Other information is placed either in the header (may be with a help of a dropdown) or in the footer of the course page.Now it’s atoms’ turn. Speaking about stories or lessons.When reading a story on Medium nothing distracts you. You start with a header covered by a big picture, read the story’s title and subtitle, throw a glance at the author’s name and the collection’s name and then scroll down or just click the arrow to read the story itself.On a story page there is only content. Nothing more. Text. And illustrations.A user had a long march from the main page through collections to finally grab this item. And there must be a clear way to do it.Codecademy shows an example of a great try: it hides all the external navigation and information to keep users strongly concentrated on the lesson. However, there are more than one ways to consume the content. And some bells and whistles confuse a bit.Since Stepic runs lessons in a special player (like the one on YouTube) it will be appropriate to show the process of consuming the content on the example of YouTube item (video).So here comes the wireframe of Stepic lessons page.One more thing is about progress.When a user finishes reading one story on Medium another story comes.The same works with lessons.And some statistics on the current lesson appears.Now it’s time for statistics.Medium has a separate page showing But it only covers user’s story as a creator. Not a reader.But when it comes to courses and lessons one should know what courses were taken and what are their statuses.My task was to make it as easy as pie to understand:And to keep the overall grace. That’s why I suggested the following sketches.One banner starts with the status (a crown means everything is solved now) and ends with the end date. Seems legit.Finally I want to highlight some ideas from this post.product managerInnovative ideas and practices how to hack education and teach better | New approaches to education, not only massive open online courses

Yalın girişimi modelini ortaya atan Lean kelimesine, özellikle de endüstri ve işletme mühendislerinin alışık olduğunu düşünüyorum. Endüstride “Lean” kelimesi hali hazırda optimizasyon ve iyileştirme süreçleri için kullanılırken, girişim ve girişimcilikte biraz farklı anlamlar alarak devam ediyor.Teknolojilerin neredeyse günlük olarak değiştiği, bu nedenle ürünün hangi özellikleriyle ve ne zaman piyasaya sürüldüğünün ölümcül etkilerinin olduğu bir zamanda çok iyi hazırlanmış prensiplerle çalışan bir üretim metodolojisi.Lean Startup konseptinin çıkış amacı, kullanıcıların ihtiyaçları doğrultusunda, doğru çözümü hızlı ve mümkün olan en az maliyetle kurmak ve yönetmek.Müşterilerin istekleri doğrultusunda, hızlı ve az maliyetli girişimler kurmak ve yönetmektir. Girişimcinin dengesini kurmaya yöneliktir, ne zaman son hızla, ne zaman yavaşlaması gerektiğini öngören sistemdir. Özellikleri çoğaltmak yerine düşük maliyetle üretilen ürün üzerinden müşterinin geri dönüşümüne göre ürünün şekillenmesi, test edilmesi ve raporlanmasıdır.En basit hatları ve çirkin çizimleriyle anlatmak gerekirse;Standart yollarda, bir problem bulunur, bunun çözümü için gerekebilecek yollar tespit edilir ve yaklaşık 6 aylık, 1 senelik belki de daha fazla sürelik bir geliştirme süreci başlatılır. Buradaki sorun, her ne kadar o 6 aylık süreci iyi yönetseniz dahi, en başta sahip olduğunuz problem artık şekil değişmiştir, ya da kullanıcılarınızın bile farkında olmadığı başka sorunlar olduğundan sonunda elinizdeki çözüm, gerçek problemi çözmeyebilir.Lean Startup methodunda ise problem tahmini ve süreçleri hazırlır, fakat 6 aylık bir geliştirmeye girmek yerine kısa zaman aralıklarıyla süreç döngüsü çalıştırılır, sonuçlarına göre problemin yeni tahmini yapılır, süreçler düzenlenir ve bir sonraki sürece kadar bu adımlar devam eder. Bu iterasyonlarla birlikte gerçek probleme en yakın çözümün bulunması sağlanır.Ben Lean Startup konseptini “Girişimciliğin Mühendisliği” olarak görüyorum. Bunu da “Bir girişimin başarılı ve sürdürülebilir olarak hazırlanabilmesi için her bir adımının onaylanarak ileriye götürülmesi, geribildirimlerin de sisteme dahil edilip, girişimin adapte edilmesiyle birlikte hataya izin vermeyen bir sistem oluşturulması” olarak tanımlıyorum.Lean Startup konseptini en iyi anlatan şeylerden bir tanesi süreç döngüsü. Adımları açıklamak gerekirse;1- Fikri bul2- Fikri yapılandır3- Kodla4- Ölç5- Çıktılarına bak6- Öğren, yeni öğrendiklerinle ilk baştaki fikri daha uygun bir fikre dönüştür.Lean Startup metodu da bu 6 adımlık süreyi en kısa zamanda yapmayı ve sık yapmanın yollarından oluşuyor.Biraz daha anlaşılabilmesi için Lean Startup Prensiplerinden başlayarak, konsepti biraz daha anlamaya çalışalım.Bir işe başlamak için bir garaja, ya da bir ofise ihtiyaç duyulmaz, girişim her yerde başlayabilecek bir oluşumdur.Girişim bir ürün değil, bir kurum / şirkettir. Bu yüzden yönetilmesi gerekir. Her farklı kurumda olduğu gibi girişime uygun yönetilme ihtiyaçları vardır.Girişimler bir şey yapalım diye, para kazanalım diye ya da insanlara hizmet edelim diye kurulmazlar. Girişimler sürdürülebilir ticaretin nasıl yapılacağının anlaşılacağı bir ön fazdır. Buradaki öğrenimlerin bilimsel olarak onaylayabilir, deneyler ve testler yapabiliriz.Muhasebe kelimesi biraz sıkıcı dursa da, girişimlerin doğası gereği yapılan inovasyonların etkisinin ölçülmesi, ne kadar ilerlendiğinin anlanabilmesi, büyük adımların planlanabilmesi ve işlerin önceliklendirilmesi gerekir. Tabi ki inovasyon olacak, ama kör bir şekilde “inovasyon” peşinde koşmak bir girişimin amacı olamaz.Girişimin en temel aksiyonu fikirlerin ürünlere çevrilmesi, onların kullanıcılar / tüketiciler tarafından nasıl karşılaşıldığının anlanması, buna göre fikri değiştirme ya da tutma kararı vermektir. En iyi girişimlerin en önemli önceliği bu geribesleme fonksiyonun hatasız ve hızlı olmasını sağlamaktır.Lean konusunda konuşacak çok şeyimiz var; bu yüzden hepsini bir yazıda toplamaya çalışmak istemiyorum. Ama güzel haberlerim de var:1- Lean Startup Circle bu methodun yaygınlaşması konusunda en aktif olarak çalışan ve Eric’le birebir iletişimde olan grup. Bu grubun Türkiye temsilcisi olarak yaz süresince yapmak istediğimiz toplantılarla ilgili görüşmeleri sürdürdük. Ekim ayında grubun başındaki 2- Meetup’a gelmekle ilgileniyorsanız 3- Bu ve sonrasındaki meetuplarda benimle birlikte çalışmak isterseniz, formun içerisindeki kısmı da doldurmanızı rica edeceğim.4- Bu meetuplarda konuşmacı ya da sponsor olmak bana Eğer Lean konusunda daha fazla bilgilenmek, süreçlerinizi incelemek ve insanlarla tanışıp, girişiminizi güçlendirmek istiyorsanız katılmanızın çok faydalı olacağını düşünüyorum. En azından güzel birkaç saat geçirip, birbirimizin girişimlerine faydalı olabiliriz.İlgileneceğini düşündüğünüz arkadaşlarınızla da bağlantıları paylaşmanızı isterim!

30-minute template cheat sheet printable coming up next week!Any mentor worth their salt might have told you that they’d like to receive an update of your progress from time to time. And that’s where an investor update comes in. As a startup, we initially didn’t realise the importance of consistently sending an update out.You don’t normally think about these things, and if you do, it’s probably not at the top of your to-do list. It’s something we learnt, and were pushed aggresively to adopt as part of our workflow, at Now investor updates aren’t necessarily just for your investors, or even potential investors — think of it as a newsletter of sorts, a way of updating your very own little tribe, so include the folks whose opinions you trust, as well as the folks who will champion you and advocate for you wherever they might be going. They don’t need to be lengthy or complicated emails either — the shorter the better, the less fluffy the better.Say you meet someone along your startup journey whose opinion you really trust, or really It’s really one of the most important things you can do for your startup as a founder.Hell yes. It’s important to start building relationships with future investors as early as possible. Keeping them updated on progress shows them that you can consistently keep the momentum going.And that’s why it’s so important to send these missives out, even if all you have are numbers that don’t seem to be going up no matter what you do, users you just don’t seem to understand, or a product that you think should probably be built from ground up. Your future investors invest in lines, not dots. Plus, asking for advice as part of your update allows them to chip in with (hopefully) constructive feedback. Because they’ve been following you from the start, they’ll know to dive deep, shaping their feedback to best fit the snapshot of your current situation, as opposed to your going out to get shallow surface advice from a totally new mentor.Note that we said As for the top-of-mind thing, put yourself in the shoes of an angel. Startups clamour to work with you, each and every single day. You probably get asked to meet a few hundred, if not thousand — and not everybody will be memorable. Wham, bam, thank you ma’am. That’s how it’s done. Check back next week, and find out how to write an investor update in 30 minutes or less. :)At Potential VC we build, grow and invest in digital companies.

It seems like everyone wants to be a SaaS founder these days. I meet with great VPs of Sales and Product in particular who are Ready. It’s time. To go out on their own. Start their own SaaS company.Awesome.I get it. I’d like to recruit you to be a VP at one of my companies, but I get it. No one ambitious wants to work for The Man. I mean, not really.1. Maybe an Instagram or a WhatsApp or a Pinterest or a Meerkat can explode in just 12 months. That just doesn’t happen in paid SaaS apps. Can you “afford” to commit for 24 months just to get to Something, to real Initial Traction? If not, you should pass.Slack went from $0 to $12m ARR in ’14. Woah. But it wasn’t founded on 1/1/14. It took them a year to get to a Minimum Sellable Product. And it was really founded as a company many years earlier, see the Crunchbase chart to the right:And the honest truth is most folks can’t really commit for 24 months. For financial, or personal, or whatever reasons. That makes sense. But you’ll fail in SaaS if you don’t commit to 24 months to Initial Traction.But can you really, honestly, commit to obsessively thinking, worrying, futzing, stressing about how to do The Impossible. Every. Single. Moment of the day.Nothing else, but work. Even when you are playing with the kids. Having dinner with your husband. Because that’s what it’s going to take. If you don’t have the mental bandwidth — you should pass. Because everything in SaaS is just insanely competitive. And also because SaaS is so multi-faceted. You’re going to have to be the VP of Sales, Customer Success, Marketing and probably Product in the early days. There’s endless drama with paying customers. You’ll almost lost your Best Logo Accounts. You have to be intensely, painfully committed to do all this.Later, there will be fat, once you get to $5m ARR or so. 3. This just never works. Not for high-growth start-ups at least. If you need to maintain optionality — you aren’t ready to do your own SaaS startup.…..Ok, now what if you aren’t Then take a pause. But don’t say no yet. Instead, go do some more homework. Because again, the great founders can see The Future. But sometimes they need a little help to get there. I did, in both my start-ups. 20 interviews and a just amazing co-founder can be the missing pieces, to show you how to really do your own SaaS start-up.Going back to one of our Dreamforce SaaStr.

Recently, during a talk I gave on startup storytelling for international entrepreneurship students at Stanford, a woman named Beatriz asked how she should answer the question she receives all the time, from investors, potential employees, and random networkers. The question, of course, is “What do you guys do?” Before responding, I posed the question to several of her classmates — each a founder — and sure enough, I got sub-optimal answers. In this post, I’ll share the advice I gave to Beatriz and her classmates for doing better.All of the answers I received from Beatriz’s classmates started with the word “we.” Trouble is, “we” statements, by themselves, are devoid of the kind of story-powered magic that boosts engagement. As you may have noticed if you’ve ever said, “We do X,” your listener will frequently counter by asking how you’re different from others who say they do X (“Subscriptions? You mean like Zuora?”), putting you immediately on the defensive. Worse, your listener may have so little experience with X (as I do with veterinarians) that he/she will simply itch for someone else to talk to.To make Beatriz’s answer more engaging, I asked her to describe one of her clients. As she embarked on the tale of Pedro, a 36-year-old veterinarian who lives in Mexico City, her face lit up.Pedro, she told me, earned his vet degree in the early 2000s, but his surgical skills — particularly for the small-animal operations that, according to Beatriz, are the bread-and-butter of many vet practices — had not kept up, and he was losing business because of it. He wanted more training, but his only option in Mexico was to enroll in a university, which would have been prohibitively expensive — and so time-consuming that Pedro would have had to shut down his practice for two to three years. According to Beatriz, there were lots of veterinarians in Mexico like Pedro, and that’s why she started her company.Together, we spent a few minutes editing Beatriz’s story to craft a new answer to “What do you guys do?”:OK, it’s not going to win an Oscar, and it can still use some polish, but hopefully you notice three important differences between this answer and Beatriz’s initial one (“We offer training for veterinarians”):Later, I helped Beatriz’s classmates craft customer-centric “What do you guys do?” answers for their own start-ups, which they tried out on each other. One man said that immediately talking about customers, instead of about his company, felt awkward at first. But he quickly got over it.“Now,” he reported, “everyone seems more interested in what I’m saying.”Helping entrepreneurs tell strategic stories. Stories about telling company stories

I don’t need to bang the drum about why security is interesting from a VC perspective. The constantly changing nature of attackers, tactics, techniques and processes, as well as a constant inflow of new controls and defence technologies, has made it a great space for venture investing.Few sectors promise such consistent and high returns , especially as many more breaches are being detected every year. So much so that 2014 is now known as ‘More scares around breaches, of course, mean more budget for security, and support is coming from the corner office — JP. Morgan’s CEO announced the bank would be With all trends in the security industry pointing up and to the right, Over the past few months, as I have spent time with the teams at So what is different…?A few weeks back, I was hanging out in my lovely home town Malmö in southern Sweden, listening to Hampus Jakobsson of I generally agree with this logic. My advice to start-ups has often been to avoid chasing clients and contracts for which you risk dying trying to cross the desert — the desert in this case being the 18 month+ sales cycle. This generally includes any organisation in financial services, government and telecom. Unfortunately for security start-ups, these are the exact clients you want and need.Although targeting SMEs may be the largest opportunity for security companies in the long run, the market is currently very different. Smaller companies either have fewer breaches or are simply worse at detecting them. Seen from another angle, cyber crime is, at its core an ROI-driven business — adversaries will be attracted to the most valuable data and the closer you are to financial information, the closer you are to financial return (all else constant). Either way you view it, demand for security products is concentrated with the large enterprise. On top of this, security is an industry where catching an elephant attracts more elephants, and potentially a long tail of deer in the long run. Signing customers that are known to be the gold standard in security, e.g. Goldman in financial services, gives the credibility to win more contracts.Eric Reis’ Lean Methodology has become the standard playbook for developing products and scaling businesses, where the best way to create a product that people love is to release one they love less, collect data and tweak the product until they love it more. There are a lot of areas where this is incredibly effective, especially for consumer products and increasingly for B2B products as the enterprise becomes more consumer-driven.Unfortunately, the idea of an MVP doesn’t quite hold up in security, or at least the definition of ‘viable’ is totally different. Look at it from a bank’s point of view: if their data is 99% secure… it’s not secure. It’s not an industry where you can send a beta version out to market to test, and look to improve the solution in version two.Secondly, it is not an industry where feedback is happily given. Unless you are in the inner circle, you are not going to get a lot out of a CISO you want to build a solution for. Outside of highly restricted industry associations and roundtables, actual issues and pain points are kept to secret.This actually poses a huge challenge for security in general, as today there is Here’s where I’m undecided. As cyber-security companies ‘need’ to work with established organisations such as banks, telcos and governments; does this mean that typical young, energetic, slightly naïve, outsider entrepreneur not hold up? Does the idea of disrupting an industry with a new perspective simply not ring true when it comes to security?On one side, entrepreneurs coming out of organisations like GCHQ or BAE Systems Detica will have access to information about the real issues CISOs are facing. They will also have a better understanding of controls already in use for specific clients and organisations that are more advanced when it comes to security. A lot of innovation is likely to come from commercialising solutions use in national defence and high-security organisations. The industry is also one where network is important to sell, as CISOs are prone to pay attention to tools recommended by people they know and trust. Breaking through the clutter is incredibly difficult in an industry where everyone claims to be selling a Lamborghini but few people know what a Lamborghini looks like. A number of early stage companies in the UK, e.g. Digital Shadows, Garrison Technology and RipJar, have significant security DNA.But there is also merit in approaching this area from an outsider point of view and there are many stories of applying powerful technologies already in use elsewhere to the security space. Balderton portfolio company As this is an industry where network is key and product development in a longer and less iterative process, a lot needs to be done in bridging the gap between start-up and industry. More so than other sectors.From an investment perspective, this means that companies will need more funding pre-revenue, whether from public or private sources. From a sales perspective it means it will be more important to know who to speak to within larger organisations and build partnerships that can champion the product and help break through the clutter.Accelerators like CyLon are a great start. Building a network of industry veterans willing to mentor start-up in the space will help bridge the gap between the security- and the start-up world, and will hopefully be a good launch pad for new technology into a relatively closed off vertical.Early stage investor 

Good marketing For my inaugural Medium post I wanted to ask you to read the story of my career to date in Silicon Valley, culminating with why I quit Google, the company of my dreams. I couldn’t offer anything particularly tempting for why you might do this, so I found you some inspirational quotes (from the Three weeks ago I quit my job at Google and joined Spreading the word is my specialty. Most recently I was the Chief The story of how my marketing career intersected with Wealthfront started many years before this, however.I developed an interest in finance while attending college at Cornell. I took finance classes, but one particular lesson stuck with me from a class textbook, “I began my career traditionally, in management consulting for IBM. Shortly after moving across the country for my IBM San Francisco assignment, choosing a place to live, and paying off my most expensive debt, I knew that it was time to create a plan for myself that dealt with my finances for the long term. I’d learned what I should be modeling from Modern Portfolio Theory: a portfolio that was highly diversified across different asset classes and that was allocated optimally according to my risk profile. I knew that trying to beat the market would likely be futile, and that walking down wall street was more “random” than anything else. As a young, urban professional, I was actively looking for an intelligent solution for managing my finances and investments, because I really didn’t want to do it myself.I’ve always believed that machines do many things better than humans, and that understanding how to optimize my finances while capitalizing on market efficiencies was one of those things. That’s why, when I stumbled across Wealthfront serendipitously by reading an article about it on TechCrunch, I funded an account and became one of its earliest adopters. I’ve been a client ever since.Meanwhile, at work, I left IBM to become closer to the Silicon Valley I was most passionate about; the land of entrepreneurs, innovative thinking, and startup culture. I joined Wildfire, a social media marketing SaaS company, as the seventh employee, and was tasked with figuring out how to spread the gospel of social media with a very low marketing budget (but a huge amount of enthusiasm).Wildfire’s growth trajectory culminated in one of the ultimate Silicon Valley success stories: Google acquired our startup in August 2012. As an early employee, I was thrilled with this new and unexpected equity event in my life, but I had a ton of questions along with it. I read every post on the Wealthfront Deciding on an investment strategy, and the way you’re going to handle your financial life, is a big decision, but it doesn’t have to be a hard one. The best time to decide is, of course, yesterday (like so many decisions you’re supposed to make to become a successful individual).The second best time is now.When I thought about trust, and where I would place mine to choose a financial advisor, I thought about expertise, thought leadership, and authority. Have you ever heard the phrase “I wrote the team my most excited and congratulatory email yet. At that point I’d interacted with members of Wealthfront’s team many times, usually when I had some feedback about marketing messaging or a new product announcement I wanted to talk about. I was an …outspoken… client. Luckily they welcomed that and as a result of these interactions I became friends with the VP of Research, One year after Wildfire’s acquisition by Google Jeff and I met for lunch to talk about the upcoming addition of another economic authority, Making the decision to leave my team at Wildfire was Life is made of stories.

As more and more products and services have some sort of digital component or touch, usage of it can be tracked, learned from and optimized unbiased. By actually understanding what customers like about your offering presents the opportunity to not only be more creativity and make a bigger impact, but also make greater products and in the end happier customers.If you study the concept and mindset of Growth Hacking you will find that it is most often applied to startups.In the heart of New York City, the center of some of the most exciting developments within technology happening right now, on Madison Avenue we opened the IBM Design Lab (now MC Lab) in 2012. The perfect place to redefine how marketing is done - taking it back to its core; whatever gets more customers can be considered marketing.As the discipline of marketing is shifting from gut-centric to data-centric, but still with people at its core (not just treating them as numbers) we have approached a new way to corporate marketing. Design Lab was established as a joint-venture between the CMO and CIO parts of the organization recognizing the importance of a cross-organizational partnership as data and analytics are becoming a part of the main foundation of marketing.“The Lab”, as it is called amongst my colleagues, functions as an incubator for internal startups (scrum teams) working on a variety of digital projects. Each scrum team consists of different skills like content strategists, designers, developers, information architects, data analysts, social business managers, along with experts of any other relevant business area required for the project. They are given almost total autonomy to spot new trends, adjust to changes and try new ideas, while focusing on designing experiences that enhance the customers’ interaction with IBM and ultimately form a scalable system of engagement. Working in this fashion minimizes the traditional big company-lead time and makes the teams very agile, similar to many startups.The teams deliver the minimal viable product that meets the need, then measure and improve repeatedly. By treating marketing as code it becomes about constantly testing, tracking, iterating and improving ‘till we make something anyone would actually care about. By thinking small, making it work and then thinking big, the enourmous gambles that typically comes with big budget launches and campaigns are not only unnecessary, but also counterproductive. It removes the pressure and adds nimbleness to the way we work, but most importantly it gives people the freedom to experiment without the fear of failing.To get growth hacking right we needed to break with the antiquated notions of what is or is not marketing and understand that what may seem like a product development strategy is also marketing. By building marketing into the products and services we launch make them more effective than bolting it on post-launch. An example that always comes to mind is how This couldn’t be further from the heydays of Mad Men, billboards and celebrity endorsment and yet the Design Lab is located on Madison Avenue, which is a signal of the changes hitting the marketing discipline and the need for adopting new ways.The next evolution in growth hacking will be the move from product-centric to experience-centric; focusing on creating great and shareable customer experiences. As These moments are no longer limited to a single channel. Customers discover, consider, purchase and advocate on social, mobile, web and in real life, but they don’t treat any one channel the same. Each channel is leveraged differently and satisfy different needs. Depending on the stage in the decision making different touch points occur and presents the opportunity for a brand to influence the customer. It is imperative to get those engagement opportunities right, regardless of source or shape, as they affect the next steps and impressions of customers and ultimately decide whether a customer will move along in the brand’s favor.The challenge presents itself when you look at most organizations where different groups own different parts of the experience and the customer journey. The mobile experience is handled seperatly from the social experience and none of them are connected with the web experience and you can add customer service as well as any offline experience. Usually they are developed independently of each other. The big issue of course is that customers only see one brand! So when the different channels work independently of one another the experience becomes broken and there is no way to create a customer journey that is optimized for the moments of truth. The challenge will be to create an organization that enables the creation of a unified and frictionless experience in every moments of truth no matter the context.To deliver this takes vision, courage and to marry organizational stakeholders (does breaking down silos sound familiar?). It is nothing new, but forward-thinking organizations are already doing interesting choices that leads in that direction. A model that combines the CDO’s vision and ability to bridge organizational groups with the ability of something similar to the Design Lab to execute and iterate fast is where the future lies for customer engagement. In the future these will be the owners of the entire customer lifecycle optimizing and enhancing every touch point along the customer journey, not just online but offline too. It cannot be a someone, a person or team that is bound to a specific function, but it needs to be someone that bridges internal interests, while still focusing on what really matters; the customers and their experience with the brand.Thank youSocial Business Manager 

Hello.I’m here to persuade you Specifically, if you think the world needs another website providing travel inspiration or an app to help with trip-planning, I’m very keen for you to read this.I don’t want to overstate the matter, but your startup will likely be dead in in a matter of months. If you’re very lucky, you’ll identify the need to pivot into something unrecognisable, or sell for pennies to a established industry player.If I sound pessimistic about your chances, let me assure you I’m not. Chances are you’re very smart, but very smart doesn’t mean you won’t do very dumb. No amount of funding will help matters.It’s happened And And And I’d like to explain why I think it keeps happening, in the hope you’ll take note and live substantially longer than others that have gone before you:At least, it’s not a I hear very few friends complaining that they don’t know where to find inspiration for their next holiday. At the very least they’ll start asking questions, not rack their brains to think of a specific website they can turn to. Most people I know relish the opportunity to daydream, to scour the internet, to #humblebrag to friends on Twitter and exchange stories at work.This all sounds like a We’re very happy wasting our time here, because it’s not time wasted — it’s escapism, and as much a valued part of our vacation as the vacation itself. And yet it’s a problem so many founders misidentify, including this Does this really sound like something so many talented developers should be pouring their brains into?The moment we sniff the chance of a vacation, we start talking to friends; buying guidebooks to read in the bath; scouring Pinterest; interrogating flight comparison sites; posting queries on Facebook; downloading apps; eyeing up package holidays on Expedia; checking exchange rates.We pool our ideas from any number of sources, and despite all this chaos, nobody is hurting for the lack of an online repository that aggregates our inspiration. A few of us might write a to-do list, start a Pinterest board, open a spreadsheet, but we’re not crying out for our adhoc processes to be packaged up with a bow. We cherish the lack of order.PathWrangler attempted to PathWrangler lasted 20 months before a lack of revenue saw it close.Let’s say you’ve ignored the first two points and are still convinced that a lack of inspiration is a genuine problem. If it is, then it’s also a problem that consumers are only likely to experience Meanwhile those people who travel regularly don’t really need to feel inspired. Business travellers are visiting pre-determined destinations; the variables will be schedule, availability and price. Inspiration doesn’t come into it.People who may consider a service providing inspiration will hardly use them; people who travel often rarely need them. You can’t build a successful service that your most engaged users will barely use.There are problems (and opportunities) in travel, but they tend to be around hard issues like logistics, schedules and pricing— the stuff everyone has to go through, regardless of frequency. You can target that slither of consumers who travel frequently for leisure, so ask yourself how you best engage them; having to download an app immediately creates friction — can you create a service that compliments or utilises a more established platform?Planning anything for a group of friends is rarely a democracy. Everyone wants the right to have their say, but the reality is most participants are lazy and will absolve themselves of all responsibility at the first opportunity.Again, there are logistical issues when it comes to group travel —how to qualify for group discounts, hotel booking sites that don’t differentiate between ‘twin’ and ‘double’ rooms — but the likelihood is that the planning stages will be led by a very small number of people, not the whole group.A non-sequitar is a conclusion that does not result from the original premise. It’s a failing in basic logic, and it’s why the world is full of bad startups:That’s fair, if you ask the other people and validate your assumption, but it then leads to:And that’s where so many startups go wrong. There are a thousand ways to solve any given problem; it doesn’t follow that because you’re capable of identifying a problem, you’ve magically determined the best solution.Group travel planning is a big problem, so that means a web app together with a calendar plugin will solve it, right? So many founders will start developing their ideas based on similar leaps of logic.If you’ve read my considered opinion and thoroughly disagree with it, that’s ok. Nobody has yet made their billions by writing a step-by-step guide to There are, however, plenty of wrong ways to go about a startup, and the travel sector knows this better than most. Take flight, but don’t crash and burn.Co-founder  CEO 

Below are some tips that we have aggregated to help startups as they grow on AWS. Most of these lessons came as a direct result of some mishap or mistake that happened in the first year of Lob. These are things that we wish we knew from day 1 that would have eliminated some early hiccups.When trying to scale engineering one of the best things we learned was to completely separate the development infrastructure from the production infrastructure. This means development and production should be on completely separate accounts. This way only those who absolutely need access to the production infrastructure have the credentials. Meanwhile, all other developers can run tests using the development account without accidently deleting an important AMI, changing a security group, or taking down a set of core servers.Not everyone in the organization is an AWS expert. From day 1, create a set of simple IAM groups that restrict access and give permissions to users. Ensure that both production and development accounts have these groups. This will eliminate a new hire or intern accidentally destroying something important. Be disciplined with your IAM access, never sign into the master account unless you have to update billing.Create at least 3 different users to access your DB — an admin, a read-only user, and a read-write user. Your application should be the only one with write access. Give everyone else read-only access. This will eliminate the probability of someone dropping or overwriting your entire users table. It happens. Ensure that your database is multi-az, has automated backs, and has DB snapshots turned on. This way when something goes wrong you can revert. Also save a full copy of your DB to S3 every night at midnight.Make sure to set up your development and production infrastructure to be identical on AWS. That includes VPC, security groups, IAM groups, AMI’s, S3 buckets. Never cross share information. This will allow your development workflow to be almost identical.Since you will most likely want to share domains across both production and development accounts there are complicated ways to share NS records so both accounts can have access to the same domain. That way you can haveDon’t rely on AMI’s. They get stale quickly and can have bad data stored on them. It is best to always start with a fresh server build. This will also force you to learn how to use Chef or Puppet early on and how best automate server configuration.Add alerts to all your AWS and DB instances. This is an easy way to know when your servers have high CPU, are down, or are running out of memory. It will also give you warnings when they are close to certain thresholds.Let us know if you found these helpful!Integrate printing  mailing into your applications with a simple API.Valuable tips, tricks, and technology to help you work smarter, earn more, and succeed in business and in life.

Back in mid-2011, I’ve been immersing myself in startup articles and trying to learn from others more experienced than myself for some time now, and Since we arrived in San Francisco, my expectations of how easy it is to meet people and how helpful people are have been surpassed. In addition, We’ve not even been along to one of the many events happening in SF yet and I’m sure that will emphasise this feeling even more.I think this point is actually pretty key for me. In the UK I found that most people didn’t “get” what I was doing or why I was doing it.For my startup this is even more apparent. In the UK I’d have to actually explain Twitter sometimes when describing what Buffer is about. Whilst even in San Francisco some people don’t use Twitter, pretty much everyone I’ve chatted to understands it and knows how powerful it is.However, with all the positive things said, there is one thing which hit me pretty hard when I first arrived. Adjusting to a new environment and finding our way around certainly took up some of my time, but We’ve been in bustling coffee shops packed with people working away, and we’ve been in quieter more relaxed places. In a “programs like TechStars are great, but they shouldn’t be the single enabler. Keep on moving forward on your company.”I feel the same about location. Sure, you might not be in Silicon Valley and you might not be able to just pack your bags and hop on a flight over here for many reasons, but Overall, I believe that for myself, What are your thoughts and experiences on the difference being in the right location can make for your startup? I’d love to hear from you in the comments.Photo credit: Founder/CEO  at Collection of posts from those who make Buffer.

(Originally published November 2012.)Some advice to companies interviewing at Y Combinator: stop focusing on hacks and just figure out your goddamn business.Six months ago, some friends and I made a somewhat last-minute decision to apply to Y Combinator. Paul Graham told us our product was “too much of a ‘startup idea’ anyway”, and Sam Altman started our interview by telling us “this is the classic example of a bad startup idea”. As you may know, we got in, and are now working on So, what was our interview “hack”? Y Combinator holds its place as the most prestigious startup incubator for good reason - the partners are the smartest group of people you’re likely to meet. As you’d expect, it’s obvious that they’re tremendously reflective on how to screen for good teams. Put this way, which do you think is more likely: you’re going to actually discover the most optimal number of times to say “we talked to users”, or the partners are going to notice that you’re trying to work it in without much meaning?Moreover, the interviews, stressful as they might seem, aren’t actually hostile to you - the partners are trying to decide if the team is a good fit for the program. Unless you’re trying to “hack” them. In which case, you’re now in some sort of stupid intellectual, statistics-based battle with the partners. Even if you somehow trick them, how long can you go on finding hacks to get around not knowing who will use your product?The Y Combinator interviews are about showing the partners that you can do what you need to do to have a successful startup. Along those lines, here are some of the things which made us successful: [1]1. Know your product inside and out. You should be able to answer 99% of questions about your market without delay, because you should have already thought about them. 2. Don’t ever talk over each other - it makes you look like you’re confused and don’t work well together. (It’s going to do this to your users, too!) If you have problems with this, you should be working on your teamwork in general.3. Know your co-founder. If you don’t already, it’s probably a bit late for this tip, but you should be aware that you’ve made a decision not unlike marrying someone you’ve been dating for a week.4. Be clear and concise. [3] If someone wants more information, they’ll ask for it. If you still aren’t sure if something is concise, try to take out 30% of the words.5. Be committed. When the partners ask you if you will continue to work on the project if you’re not accepted, you need to honestly answer yes. Have an honest conversation with your co-founder(s) ASAP if you haven’t discussed your actual feelings on the matter.Seems simple, but these things are often out of the comfort zone of the founders, and never get done. It may be more comfortable to try to hack the process, but building up a strong business is a more assured path to success.[6]1. Evaluating my own tips against my evaluating criteria:1.1. Sort of goes without saying, but knowing your product is quite useful for figuring out where you’re going, knowing what questions to ask users, talking to the press, and talking to any investors worth talking to.1.2. Having a team which trusts each other and an environment free of people trying to one-up each other is a fairly well-documented necessity for success.1.3. See the large number of horror stories.1.4. Useful for talking to users, talking to press, talking to family and friends.1.5. By definition, continuing to work on the product without YC is beneficial to working on the product ignoring YC.2. I’m not saying iPG will solve all your problems. Almost every product has its own set of questions. Any smart investor is going to ask about those. What are yours?3. If you’re not concise, you run the risk of the partners cutting you off because they’ve formed a questionably-accurate picture in their mind of what you mean. The same thing will happen in the real world - it’s called tuning out. In the real world, it’s often difficult to get the right balance, because users are stupid. YC partners are not stupid.4. Not all good “hacks” fit perfectly in this criteria - 5. In fact, saying you “talk to users” as often as possible is probably harmful, in that you’ll only bring on awful investors.6. For the sake of completeness, I’ll mention that it is possible that attempting to “hack” the interviews is a good predictor of success. This runs against the advice I’ve been given by many alums (as well as my common sense), however.Program director at StudentRND.

They figured out that folks started using less energy when you told them how their electrical bill compared to their neighbors. They built some great products around that insight and sold them to utilities around the world. Along the way, they’ve kept over 6 trillion pounds of CO2 from re-entering the atmosphere. Oh, and they both just earned over $100m.The best thing about stories like this is that they’re not just great for those directly involved. They’re great for all of us who are trying to build things that actually matter.

Many entrepreneurs dream of having their startup become the next Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter… However, to learn from their success you need to go back in time and not be blinded by who they are today. Look at these companies when they were no bigger than your startup is today. What made them grow faster than their competition? Let’s look at the hacks that turned around these little startups into the giants they are today and how you can learn from their success.In 1979 Microsoft was one of the many startups, trying to break through in the PC industry. In the late 1980s however, Microsoft controlled the operating system industry. Versions of MS-DOS ran on more than 80% of PC’s. How did this happen? The ‘growth hack’ that fueled Microsoft’s growth curve in this early stage was: In 1980, Microsoft formed a partnership with IBM that enabled them to bundle Microsoft’s OS (MS-DOS) with IBM computers. IBM would pay Microsoft a royalty for every sale. The platform was now able to quickly gain critical mass and achieve network effects.Who can you partner up with? Standing on the shoulders of giants can be a great way to fuel your startup’s growth. Find a partner that already has an established distribution channel, targeting the same audience as you are. Find ways to deliver value this potential partner with your product.In 1976 Apple released the Apple I, the company’s first product. Built by Steve Wozniak and marketed by Steve Jobs, the company eventually sold about 200 before jumping to their next product, the Apple II. Though the Apple II was a big improvement, it still didn’t dramatically boost the company’s growth. Until one VisiCalc was the first spreadsheet computer program, originally released for the Apple II. It turned these strange new machines called What killer-app or killer-feature can turn your startup around? What single feature or use of your product can dramatically improve people’s lives?

There are very few people in this world who could be objectively considered mentors, and guess what, you are probably not one of them. I, for instance, am not one for sure. I couldn’t be a mentor for anybody, unless I pretend to. I may give you some specific advice, if you explicitly ask me for, but I don’t guarantee they’re good advices. It’s just my humble opinion. Or, as Our team is currently building Some mentors say we need to have a clear business model before we even start wandering about building a prototype. Some others maintain we shouldn’t care of it, and that reaching many users first is the most important thing.Some claim we need to have a very specific, limited, and local target for our product, and we should never pronounce the word ‘everybody’ in relation to it. Some others guarantee that a consumer product should obviously be for everybody.Some recommend to carefully listen to people because they know what they want. Some state, quoting Ford, that if you had asked people what they wanted they would have said faster horses, not cars.Some assert design doesn’t matter and a good product is good whatever it looks like. Some argue that design is the only difference between good and bad products.If you’re running or have run a startup this may sound very familiar to you. In the end, you get very disparate critics, appreciations, opinions and points of view, which is very good. But that’s not the way they call it. They usually sit there, arms crossed, leering sideways at us and our roadmap and our efforts, grinning at our ridiculous attempts at arguing with their sacred gospel. Which between the lines implies something like this:And of course the truth is that everybody can have different opinions, and everybody is right because they take those opinions from their experience, and everybody has different experiences. The big mistake they make is that they believe those opinions to be valid and true for everybody else and for every other situation. These self-proclaimed mentors and serial entrepreneurs are sometimes just too superb. They consider themselves like prophets for they had some success, which probably didn’t even depend on them.Pardon our excessive impetus. But really, we all startuppers have had enough. If we need some advice, we’ll ask you, no doubt. We also love criticism and we’re probably the most cynical and schizophrenic critics of ourselves. But next time you, dear mentor, are about to tell us what you think of our product, remember we’ll take it for what it is: nothing more than Interaction designer, blogger, game developer, sometimes tech enthusiast and sometimes tech pessimist.

Hoisting himself atop a table, serial entrepreneur and Koa Labs founder Gathered at Torres took the stage with a nearly definitive talk on startup hiring, from when to hire, why to hire, and how to tell if someone is a fit for your team. When dealing with co-founders or early hires, he advises, recruiting should be treated like courting, as the early startup process is akin to entering a marriage. Thus, recruiting should be more of a “hanging out” process, rather than a resumé-reading frenzy.“Don’t hire for skills. Hire for the people,” Torres says. Palmer concurred, adding that For the first few handfuls of employees, Hodges says, culture is a huge ordeal. “Every new hire can have a potentially huge impact on the way the company runs,” she says. “You can tell very quickly if a new hire is going to be detrimental to the company’s culture.” When you find yourself in that predicament, “Fire fast,” says Hodges. “I’ve never regretted firing someone. But I’ve always regretted not doing it sooner.” As soon as the feeling starts sinking in that a hire isn’t the right fit, do something about it, she advises. You’re only wasting time and resources keeping a lemon around.Before getting yourself down a rabbit hole of cultural ickiness, Palmer offers up the Above all else, founders should keep their radars abuzz for amazing candidates, the speakers agreed. For startups, the key to success is finding great people. Roles and duties change, but great people will typically always be great and will improve with experience.The best people are the ones who are already employed, though, the speakers warned. They’re not looking for you, so you have to be on the lookout for them. Keep a list of people you want to hire, Palmer says. When a startup you admire fails, go chat with the key teammates and test their interest in your work. It all comes down to ABR, says Palmer: “Always Be Recruiting.”The role of startup founder is that of a recruiter. Hone your skill of spotting great people and do whatever it takes to get them on board. Without a great team, a startup is nothing.

The recipe for a successful startup soup is as follows: throw super-bright nerds in a saucepan, sprinkle liberally with enthusiasm, and heat with as much funding as you can scrape together.It sounds simple, but the failure rates are high. No matter how hard you stir, or how brilliant your nerds, your soup can end up tasting like cheap packet ramen. Which is why so many startups are now hiring in-house chefs.Successful companies like Google, LinkedIn, Zynga, Palantir, Dropbox, and Airbnb all started food programs early in their lifetimes. Hiring an in-house chef hasn’t always been high on a startups’ list of priorities, but it was only a matter of time before smaller companies began to catch on. For the CEO of Bandpage J. Sider, the economic calculation is simple. In the Bay Area startup scene, the average employee salary is around $100,000. Break that down to a per-hourly rate, and each employee costs $48 per hour-long paid lunch break.Because the operational costs of food programs are both ordinary and necessary, they’re tax deductible business expenses. Coupled with the fact that unconsumed food can be donated to organizations like The equation is even better for employees. Assuming that an average meal ticket at an area restaurant is $12, eating two meals a day at the office at least four days a week can save over $5000 in post-tax money a year. Many food programs also supplement meals with snacks, CSA boxes, and alcohol, meaning that the actual savings are higher. One software engineer at Stripe, the mobile payment platform for developers, reported that eating at the office’s in-house food program was now saving them close to $10,000 a year.Of course, it’s possible to construe these programs as a sinister tactic to keep employees bound to their desks for more hours. But, sharing meals has a more complicated relationship to success than the purely economic.For Airbnb’s Chef Sam Lippman, food provides an emotional connection. No matter what you’re working on or who you’re working with, says Lippman, lunch-time is a shared experience, an informal chance to talk and exchange ideas. “It brings disparate teams together, allows for cross-pollination of ideas, and is one of the secrets to our success.”It’s hardly surprising that in-house chefs see themselves as providing an intimate form of support. Thumbtack’s Exec Chef Aubrey Saltus says that she feels like a mom to the whole company. “I provide a home cooked meal each day and an opportunity for family bonding. I’ve developed a strong connection that transcends food… I’ve had employees come to me and cry on their last days.”As engineers brag about their startup’s food quality to friends, food programs have become powerful recruiting and retention tools. At Bandpage, says Chef Callie Waldman, all interviewees are screened around the lunch table in a casual setting. “This tends to put people at ease and I’ve had current employees tell me that our kitchen was a major driver in joining us over another opportunity.”With in-house food programs fast becoming a competitive industry, hiring a chef is no longer a lavish Silicon Valley extravagance. Just start with the “minimal viable product [MVP]”, and hack it from there. According to Waldman, “No stage in a startup is permanent, and your food program can be bootstrapped too… Start with a part-time chef, one meal and a few snacks a week. Just make sure you lay the groundwork with intention.”Zynga’s Bairam Jacobsohn also advocates a back-to-the-basics approach. “Start with sandwiches and build from there. Get product development feedback from your employees — they know what they need, and they are your user. Develop an MVP around them and work closely with your office managers. And sooner or later you end up with the oven you need.”Today, both Airbnb and Zynga sit at the pinnacle of the corporate dining experience. But it didn’t start that way. According to Lippman, Airbnb fed almost 300 employees with an improvised kitchen. “We had a grill on the roof, rice cookers and inductions stoves, and we did a bunch of raw vegan stuff.”Zynga’s Jacobsohn describes the beginning of their food program as a guerrilla world. “It was a lot of responsibility. But we were ready for the challenge. Ready to solve problems. Facilities and equipment can be expensive, but we proved that benefits outweighed the costs with our approach. The costs came down with scale and then flattened out.”Chefs, by the nature of their work, embody a consummate hacker ethos. They ship rapidly iterated product every day, to real customers. Recipes are their spec sheets, and the tools in front of them, no matter how limited, are the resources they use to build. This can be inspirational to the rest of the team, because the right chef “knows how to roll with the lunches” says Jacobsohn. “They’ll go to the end of the earth to make sure their employees are healthy and happy.”Chefs are attracted to startups by a full-time salary, benefits and sane working hours, all of which are rare in traditional restaurant kitchens.Former CouchSurfing Chef Ken Hernandez advocates “plugging into the active and vibrant office manager network,” like Most importantly, your candidates should reflect the culture you want to build and have passion for your company’s mission and vision. A chef who doesn’t gel with the company can kill the entire program. “It’s such an important position,” says Lippman. “You need to make sure that their interests align with yours, just like for any other leadership role at a successful company.”Once you’ve narrowed down your list of candidates, make sure you test them hard. Founders and HR folk will already be familiar with the relevant interview techniques, as hiring a chef is strangely similar to hiring an engineer! “Ask to test them for a week and pull out some Top Chef-style [stuff],” says Jacobsohn. “Throw in some wrinkles and challenges to see how they react… The best chef for you is a problem solver who shows a passion for what they’re doing, and for what the company is doing.”In data-driven Silicon Valley, the proof is in the pudding. Or the sandwich, or the soup. No matter which crappy pun you decide to go with, in-house chefs are proving that they play a successful role not only in providing companies with an economic edge, but with a social one as well. After all, if your programmers aren’t eating, they’re probably not coding either!—is a startup based in San Francisco, whose mission is to help food businesses thrive.

I recently took over as one of the “Curators” for the Silicon Valley edition of As curators, we receive dozens to hundreds of submissions for local startup events every week, and our job is to filter and curate a select number of events that we deem to be the “best”……And therein lies the inherent challenge — Every week some events are a clear “Yes”, some are a clear “No”, and the rest are total toss-ups that could go either way. Which begs the question, what makes a *good* startup event?It seems like such a simple question, but the more I thought about it the more I realized how loaded it is with subjectivity, which is why my co-Curator and I felt the need to document and open-source our event selection criteria guidelines.By eliciting your feedback, we can hopefully start converging on a widely accepted description of what a “good startup event” entails. Our hope is that by being as objective and transparent as possible, no one can accuse us of playing favorites and there will always be a clear consistency in the way we select events.To start off, my co-curator and I tried to sum up in 1 sentence what makes a quality startup event, and here’s the Version 0.9 that we came up with:In addition, here are some of the key criteria that we consider -For the purposes of Startup Digest, we define “event” as a gathering of people, open to the public, convening at a designated time and place in order to discuss or engage in a common interest.This means that things like accelerator programs (which are selective) and paid membership-based communities do not qualify as events and thus do not qualify for Startup Digest in and of themselves.The Startup Digest community as we understand it is a very diverse one, consisting of founders, investors, engineers, designers, marketers, product managers, etc. There are tons of great resources for any one of those verticals, but our job is to focus on *startup* events, since an interest in startups is the one thing that all SD subscribers have in common.That’s why it’s called “Startup Digest” and not “Tech Digest” or “Design Digest”. It’s certainly possible that a niche technical event can provide valuable insight for a startup founder and we’d certainly consider it, but startup-focused events will always take priority over more general engineering/design/marketing events.Specific and focused events are more likely to attract attendees with a lot in common, which will lead to more fruitful interactions and networking. An example of a focused event would be a Bitcoin hackathon or a talk on how to build a top engineering/sales team.On the other hand, general events with a hazy focus (e.g. “the latest in tech” or “the biggest mobile trends”) are likely to attract a more casual, disinterested crowd, and we are less likely to include those kinds of events in the digest.It makes our job as curators easier when an event is already “pre-vetted” i.e. has received a stamp of approval from someone else whom we already know and/or respect. Specifically, we are partial to events with quality speakers, quality venues, and quality sponsors (in that order).For example, an event featuring a talk by a household name like Steve Blank or David Heinemeier Hansson would be a no-brainer. These are people with limited time and a brand to protect, and they probably would not lend their name and time to an event unless they thought it was very high quality.An event that is taking place at the HQ of a highly respected company like Twitter, Stripe, or Dropbox has a much better chance of making the cut. These companies probably would not lend out their event spaces to just anyone, and the same goes for sponsoring.By “interactive” and “hands-on” we mean events like hackathons, workshops, etc. as well as larger events that include a hackathon or workshop component.We’re less likely to approve “networking for the sake of networking” events unless they have some other redeeming quality. We believe that all events by their very nature are “networking events” and that networking happens most naturally and effectively when there is a common, specific topic of interest or task at hand.If an event seems like it’s more meant to promote a company and it’s own product(s) rather than to benefit its attendees, that’s a big no-no in our book. This also goes for “events” that are actually just paid classes or tutorials.The question we ask ourselves when faced with an event that offers clear value but has a high price point ($50) is, “Are there any other events this week or in the next few weeks that offer the same value but at a lower price (or for free)?”All other things being equal though, the more affordable the event, the better. Given the vast selection of events that are constantly taking place in the San Francisco Bay Area and the age of unprecedented online access to quality content that we’re living in, there’s no reason you should have to pay hundreds of dollars to attend an event. (Unless the event is so impressive and unique that its value more than justifies its high price tag.)Even today’s top “star” founders and startup companies all started from the bottom at one point. Likewise, we understand that smaller grassroots events and event-based organizations may not have the marketing muscle that larger, more well-known brands have, and we consider it one of our duties at Startup Digest to help surface those small but quality events that might otherwise have trouble getting publicity.In the absence of any other information, the best (and really only) way for us to know if an event is good or not is to meet the event organizers in person and attend the event ourselves, time permitting. As curators, we always try to speak or meet with event organizers whenever necessary, and nothing makes us happier than when organizers reach out to us first.If you are an event organizer and you believe your event is high quality but lacks the requisite “star power”, then the best thing to do is reach out to us and show us how awesome you are.Whether you agree or vehemently disagree with these criteria, we’d love if you could let us know so that we can keep refining them. The more feedback and constructive criticism we receive, the closer we’ll get to our goal.And sign up for the Startup Digest in your area Hungry and Foolish. Literally. // placeholder text

The first in our new The idea behind the series is to help large companies see what’s coming next. To stop them from becoming the next Blockbuster, Borders or Blackberry. But also to provide a source of inspiration. We want to look at the ways in which these startups are disrupting the status quo, highlighting new products and services, technologies, business models, and ways of working.Startup Watch is a new fortnightly / monthly / whenever-we’ve-got-a-spare-hour blog series focused on startups.It’s like To put together the series, we’ll be scouring the best articles, blogs, tweets and podcasts on startups. We’ll be looking at where the money’s flowing, through traditional venture capital or on crowdfunding sites like To kick things off, this month we want to focus on the trend in anonymity. Over the past two decades the rise of social networks and the shift to cloud computing has led to unprecedented levels of information sharing and transparency. Privacy concerns were set aside in favour of tweets and selfies, and the ability to access information from anywhere. The trend seemed irreversible. But in the last year we’ve seen a distinct shift in attitudes. Companies are seeking to profit from privacy. So what does this all mean for corporates? Is the trend in anonymity here to stay or just a post-Snowden fad? Time will tell but, in the meantime, companies should be thinking about what privacy means for their organisation, and whether there’s an opportunity to meet changing consumer needs. Of course, it won’t make sense for all companies to launch security-heavy or anonymous products and services. You probably don’t need an encrypted daily newspaper or a self-destructing chocolate bar. But there may be other ways to profit from the trend — beefing up data security to prevent embarrassing breaches or using privacy as a competitive differentiator, for example by offering a premium, ad-free version of your service or promising never to sell customer data.So that’s it for the first Startup Watch post. Let us know what you think. Is the trend here to stay? What other startups are entering this space? And what about corporates — how are they responding to growing concerns about privacy? Plus let us know what you’d like to see in future posts. What are some of the trends and companies you’re seeing in the startup world that big business should be keeping a watchful eye on?For a daily dose of emerging startups, follow me on twitter 

Obviously Product Hunt attracts a startup oriented audience. This is a product that is aimed and helps that audience so it got a lot of play. But there are plenty of collections of startup tools — including on Product Hunt itself. There are specific reasons why Startup Stash got 1149 (at the time of writing) instead of 300.Startup Stash is successful because it is Startup Stash is organized into categories of ten products each. This saves users time finding the tools they need. In particular, I love this insight about how the categories are organized:Bram thought about what a first time visitor needs. Sure, an alphabetical list would work and everyone would understand that organizational framework. However, some visitors might not even know where to start. There’s a reason they’re looking for tools: they need help! Bram helped them by showing visitors where to start. It’s subtle but it’s a great attention to detail.Bram states many times that Startup Stash in its current form is an MVP. I am always fascinated by what and how makers choose to include in their product launch, so let’s focus on that.Thanks for joining me for day two of Product Exercise. I’m writing these to push myself, but the love on social media is really encouraging and energizing. I’ll be posting another Product Exercise tomorrow in Product Thinking Critically about Products

Most people don’t know this about me, but in college, I started and failed 5 businesses in a wide variety of markets, from athletic equipment, to travel apps, and health beverages. Some of these startups failed due to lack dropping out of school to focus on them, but, for the most part, they failed due to naiveté. I didn’t know what it meant to work my ass off, and I certainly didn’t listen to anybody when they told me what it meant. Post college, I co-founded DropertyTax.com to help homeowners drop their property taxes, which, to this day, is mildly successful.I have learned a lot of what not to do, but I still make mistakes all the time. My personal key to improving as an entrepreneur has been to acknowledge my mistakes and own them. I recognize that I am terrible at many things including math and anything remotely technical. Acknowledging your weaknesses helps illuminate your strengths. I am proud to be the dumbest person on my team, because I only hire people who have skills that I do not, and can fill the gaps created by my own weaknesses.Many people call themselves idea people. I have a little leather-bound notebook (which I suggest everybody keep in their back pockets) with hundreds of ideas jotted down. Ironically, the companies that I have started are not written down in that book. Why? Because there is no way in hell I would be able to forget them, let alone stop thinking about the idea for long enough to get a good night’s sleep.The difference between an idea person and an entrepreneur is action, but most importantly, burning passion. Your startup will own your life, so if every bone in your body is not aching to start this company and make it a huge success, then you will most likely burn out and give up. When you have that burning desire to build something that solves a real problem — Nobody told me how to be a good team builder. I just do what I wish all the bosses would have done at companies where I was fired or quit. Celebrate everything. Do eccentric (and hopefully endearing) things that make your employees laugh. You don’t need to be best friends with all your employees, but they must be comfortable around you. You can pay someone all the money in the world, but If they don’t like what they are doing, if they don’t feel like they are appreciated, or don’t like coming into the office, then they will not work their hardest.I do random things to keep it interesting in the office, from surprise bonuses to dancing at my desk. They laugh at me, but respect me because they see that I truly care about them, and about our mutual success. I keep a bottle of good whiskey in my desk to toast milestones. Everybody has a standing desk and a bouncy ball to sit on. I make a big deal out of people’s birthdays. As a founder, it is your job to nourish your employees’ health and happiness, because without them you would most likely be screwed. Stop thinking about it and just do it. If, like I mentioned before, you can’t sleep because you are too amped up about your idea, chances are there is someone out there with the same idea just as amped and with more resources and experience to get it done. Don’t let this get you down — every good idea has been had at least a dozen times. Be a bull. Make quick decisions and take decisive action. Build a sense of urgency into everything you do. When you move fast, you discourage others from following suit. I should mention that you should do a bit of idea and market validation, and seek advice before diving fully in, but once you get going, major roadblocks will show themselves. Be optimistic. Put the fires out as they come — don’t go searching for every reason to doubt or quit before doing anything.When you have something to lose, you become much more motivated to find solutions to even the most daunting problems. If you have nothing to lose, the simplest problem or roadblock will seem like a non-starter. I went from idea conception to building a great team and launching Roost* in 10 months. Urgency leads to accomplishing things. As you keep accomplishing, aka executing, you build up momentum. In the startup world, people notice and feel your momentum, and want to get on board. Roost’s first investor, who committed $100k after our second meeting — because I asked him for it flat out — said to me as we were talking terms, “You could bootstrap, or better yet, take this and do it right the first time.” Bootstrapping makes things take wayyy longer than if you put resources directly towards the end goal. Bootstrapped companies rarely make headlines. If two companies are competing in the same industry, the financially secure company will always win. This holds true for hiring a team as well. Too many times I see founders being very stingy with equity, and they turn to outsourcing development, and trying to do everything with some sort of hack. While it may be cool when it works, I much prefer to negotiate a good deal, put the money in, and do it right the first time. I say this from having done it both ways. I am not stingy with the equity that I give to my early employees. When you hire skilled people, others will try to hire them away from you. If someone is irreplaceable, make sure they are properly anchored and incentivized to stay for the long haul.Ask for a discount, ask for an upgrade, ask for double, ask someone to leave their old job, ask the girl or boy at the bar for their number. Nothing will ever be handed to you. Relentless hustler~advisor~troublemaker~optimist~freestyle rapper.

Startups go through many different phases. These phases provide fundamentally different opportunities and work for employees. Which phase is the best for you will determine when the best time to join is.If you care about pure financial gain you’ll want to get in early — The earlier the better as a general rule of thumb. If you care about solving interesting challenges that businesses only face as they scale, you’ll want to join later on.The phases of risk, reward, and role are on a spectrum for a startup. Challenges you’ll be able to face in each stage are very different. In general, there are three phases which you can join a startup.If you have any specialized skills, then joining a startup too early will leave you feeling under-utilized. In the early days everything is so general that few specialized skills are needed immediately — and if they are, the founders normally have enough of that covered to start. This is generally a startup less than 10 people.Jumping in too late and you’ll feel like just another employee at a great company. You won’t be known as one of the initial members of the start-up, as in one of the first few at the company. You wont make the connections and the networks that the others have. You wont have deep personal relationships with the founding team. This might start happening at around 30-40 people.So is 10-20 people a sweet-spot at joining a startup? It might be, but think through some basic questions first before signing up. Do you believe in their mission? The team? Is there a market? Are investors taking interest (if you care about quick growth)?If it’s a yes for all of this, then perfect. Looks like the startup you’ve found is at the perfect stage for you to be one of the first great employees.They’ll have a vision. They’ll have a team. They’ll have made some impressive progress. They’ll be great people. All is great!But, they’re in an inflection point in their timeline.For the first time they’re thinking through process. They’ll be thinking through budgets, through culture, through HR. That means these processes and functions wont exist yet. You’ll have to be prepared for some bumps.The first on-boardings will be rough. The tools will be limited. The resources constrained. The problems won’t always be challenging — but they’ll will take You wont benefit from the mistakes of others because there You are a trailblazer. This is how you significantly affect the company.Your startup is still very much at war and you’ll be joining in mid fight. That means the expectation is for you to put on your boots and grab any old gun. There isn’t a lot of time for training or explanation…Your skills and specializations are great. They’re exactly what the company needs. But it also needs a bunch of jr. tasks to be done — and you’ll be the best person for that job.You’ll be a commander and a foot soldier all in one. @bhorowitz makes a great point when he talks about The benefit of being a commander/foot-soldier is that you control the movements of an army. You’ll be able to set the direction and implement processes you want, in a way that future soldiers will follow.You’ll fix everything you hated about your last job. You can structure it in the way you would have always wanted it. You’ll use the tools you love and build a product, team, and company you’re proud of. You will learn. This is your Masters Degree.Joining a startup between 10-20 employees is great. You’ll be the one solving the challenging problems as they come up and the interesting ones once you have time to focus on them. Your team will grow beneath you.Do you want to The first lets you think for months about an interesting challenge.

In other words I’m at least 1/2 And don’t worry, although this A few months ago The New York State Supreme court recently lifted a restraining order on a start-up called HAILO. The actual court case isn’t very interesting but the first sentence of an article in To give a little background, HAILO is a start-up enabling New Yorkers to summon cabs through their smartphones.I laughed when I first heard it. It taps into a true and apt criticism of the current start-up world. Companies solving problems that aren’t really problems. Stacking solutions on top of solutions. Now, I don’t want to speak for What does that even mean?

I guess I’m just tapping into my inherit idealism. The current era of millionaires is a of a different form than those in previous decades and centuries.

What is the most important thing to have for any SaaS startup? It’s definitely (not venture capital) At a certain stage of development, most businesses begin to get consistent organic traffic. It’s that moment when you no longer work for a reputation, but the reputation starts working for you: niche sites and blogs regularly review or feature your product and the word of mouth gets unstoppable.However, as the time machine hasn’t been invented, you can’t obviously just jump right into this heavenly stage. So what to do when you’ve got a Unfortunately, I can’t give you a simple answer and offer a panacea solution that works in 100% cases. And I doubt anyone can do that. What I’m going to do is to share our own experience at The majority of first-time IT entrepreneurs believe that the key to success is getting publications on such media giants as Well, first of all,Secondly, Speaking about roads to success, Paul Graham describes a startup life through the following curve:The graph illustrates hot initial growth might be followed by a plunge. In the ideal world a growth curve will look like the pink one below, however, in reality it’s similar to the green line: One thing I know for sure — you need to experiment with different tactics and approaches to come up with a perfect balance. Below I’m revealing what kind of promotion we’ve been up to for the last month.One of our first activities was submitting Everhour to a number of blogs and sites reviewing startups or web apps. The list looks like Obviously, you come across both free and paid options. We’ve personally decided to pay 3-4 times and haven’t actually been impressed with the results, to say the least. Honestly, we’ve received tons more traffic from free articles while the highest number of visits and conversion rates was from independent reviews we had nothing to do with.In terms of reviews, I’d point out two things to keep in mind:For instance, we wanted to get a paid sponsored post on Some of the sites we looked into boasted a pretty good Alexa rank but after we contacted the resource representatives for details, we saw that, for instance, the daily visitor figure was around 200. Which doesn’t seem impressive at all when you’re asked to pay $80 for posting an article.Blogging and guest posting are great free ways to attract visitors by generating quality content. We’ve witnessed how such companies as Mint, BufferApp, Groove have gained recognition and acquired a huge audience with their corporate blogs.I know some people have negative feelings about ads but they are a fast and in most cases, guaranteed-results way to gain traffic. We’ve tested the waters with three popular options: We got inspired to try the paid discovery on this site after coming across this The campaign lasted for three weeks with the Here is a The main page ad slots are available for almost every day BUT! here your pay per impressions and given the number of Reddit visitors, you can imagine how much money you’ll need.Google Adwords advertising is in fact not as complicated and expensive as many may think.

So make sure you offer users a quality solution to their needs and have a crystal clear understanding of what your unique selling point is, since this is what your whole campaign will be based on — telling people why they should use exactly your product.Creativity generator, linguist, big dreamer, dancer and movie junkie; contributor to 

All startup teams need help. The good news is that there is no shortage of “startup mentors” out there. The bad news is that there is no shortage of “startup mentors” out there. How you recruit and work with your advisors is critical as the right advisors managed properly can really have a powerful impact on your business.Many startups that I work with like to build as impressive a list of advisors as they can. When talking with founders about advisors, I usually focus on two things:The Team’s NeedsLook at the needs of your business over the next six months to a year and then look at the skills of your team. You will have a lot of gaps. Start to think how an advisor can fill some of those gaps. Some teams will need help figuring out BizDev or do pricing of their products. Some will need help with higher level technology decisions-or someone to interview a CTO candidate/co-founder. Some teams have all the necessary parts but lack a little “gray hair” or folks with the battle scars of doing business a long time. Some teams lack the network to raise money and some teams lack domain experience. (Which I question why are you in that business in the first place.)You need to find advisors who can augment your team with skills, experience, and connections. If you are all PhDs in astrophysics and are building a related startup, you don’t need the head of your University’s Physics department or even a Nobel winning Physics on your advisory team. You will need some people with business and fundraising experience. Also, don’t try to go get famous people to be an advisor; I know that Mark Zuckerberg is not meeting with you monthly and won’t add much value except for the coolness factor.The good news is that there are a ton of people out there willing to give you advice. The challenge is keeping the advisors engaged.The Dreaded Conversation: How to Formalize and Compensate an AdvisorYour advisors mean well and want to help, but they are busy people. You need to set the expectations up front as to what kind of advice you need and how often you will be asking for it. If you don’t have this conversation with your advisor, you run the risk of some very misaligned expectations, leading to a bad experience for both sides. Typically for companies that I advise, we usually have a call once month or every six weeks. But when something comes up that I am uniquely qualified for, the frequency is higher.You also need to formalize your relationship with you advisors! This is important for several reasons, but the first is legal liability. If overnight your company is worth billions and your advisors have been informally advising you without a contract, they may think that they are due a large stake in your company and sue. Another reason to formalize your advisor’s relationships is that by formalizing it, they will take the relationship more seriously. So many companies ask me to advise them, but the ones I say yes to and have a formal agreement with, I feel more obligated to make the time for. An easy way to lock down an advisor is to use one of the standard Advisor Contracts. I have used Lastly, you need to compensate the advisors in order to keep them engaged. If your advisors want a huge chunk of your company or a salary or stipend, they are not the advisors for you. Use the following matrix to determine how much to compensate the advisor with. First determine what stage your company is at: idea, startup, or growth. Idea is usually pre-seed, startup is usually Seed stage, and Growth is typically a Series A or later. (I explain the Lastly, have a vesting schedule and a way to easily remove the advisor. Typically you have an advisor for a year or two, depending on the need of your team. For example, if you lack a technical team at the idea stage and engage with an advisor who is very technical and expected to help you recruit and hire an CTO within a year, you probably only need to sign that advisor up for a year or two. Then make room for other advisors in other domain areas.Advisory Board vs Board of DirectorsWhat is the relationship between a Board of Directors (BOD) and your advisors? Nothing. More importantly, your board members are responsible for the governance of the company and legally liable for its execution, while your advisors are responsible for nothing and legally liable for nothing. Your directors have high engagement, often meeting in person several times a year. Your advisors are less engaged and often engaged via email and Skype.CommunicationYou should update your advisors (and investors) with a bi-weekly or monthly email: explain the good, the bad, the ugly since the last email communication. At the end of the email put in the ask, or what you want your advirosrs to pay attention to or what you need from them. While your advisors may only skim over the updates as they come in, at your next call, the advisors can review those emails before the call and make the call more efficient. You won’t have to spend the first 10 minutes of the call updating the advisor on what happened over the past month. I love getting these emails, it shows me that the companies that I advise are organized and understand proper time management.My Experiences AdvisingI’ve advised many companies over the years. I’ve been asked by many more than I’ve said yes to, I only say yes to companies that I can add value, are in an exciting space, and the founders are awesome people to work with. (Now that I am an investor, I say no to almost 100% of the asks to prevent a signaling issue. I did, however, recently agree to become an advisor to a company where my skills made me uniquely qualified to help.)What was my experience like? Some companies rarely contacted me. Some contacted me randomly, usually when they needed some specific advice. Other’s scheduled a regular phone call. I’ve done it all: lots of general strategy, accelerator application advice, fundraising tips, team compensation, interviewing CTO candidates, make introductions, MA advice, and sitting in-between founder breakups. I’ve even pretend to be Some of my companies have had exits, sometimes the money from my shares was great; one exit was small and paid for an awesome dinner and night out with the team. One company I advise recently shut down and I helped the founder find a new gig. All my experiences were worth the time I put in and lots of fun.Lastly, I learned a lot advising, as much as I taught the founders!Geek. Entrepreneur. Investor. Mountain climber. Sports fan.

Jumping head first into a startup, fresh from a cosy university lecture theatre, is not dissimilar to cautiously picking your way across a sharp coral reef and then having the guts to launch yourself into double overhead surf. In both cases, you are stepping some way outside of your comfort zone.It is easy to lose focus on your startup idea or be demotivated by the perpetual walls of crushing white-water and strong rip currents. Despite giving it everything you have, it can sometimes feel like you’re going backwards. That said, the rewards – once you reach them – could not feel any more exhilarating.Writing over a hundred years ago Jack London eloquently explained the best tactic to employ when you get hit by big waves:This same tactic works just as well in a startup environment. If you are constantly trying to fight small deviations from your original idea, refuse to adapt to innovations in the industry, you’ll very quickly run out of steam. Being open to new ideas and knowing when it is time to adapt or switch track is one of a startups greatest assests.Those at the top of their game both in the ocean and on land tend to have desperate, obsessive focus. In startups this means throwing every fibre of your being into the project. In surfing, focus means going out into the ocean every day, even when the conditions are onshore and messy and your wetsuit is freezing cold.In the water this means watching others in the water, how deep do they sit in the line-up? How early do they kick off the wave to avoid the dry section? In startupland it is incredibly helpful to model your strategy on successful people who have braved the road before you. Why did they succeed? Or perhaps a better question to ask would be why did they fail?The Kelly Slaters and Jack Dorsey’s of this world make their success look easy, inevitable. They have the frustrating ability of gliding serenely along the surface as if they’re not even trying. It’s important to realise that 99% of the time this is an illusion. Their performance only looks so effortless because of the sheer number of hours they have spent in gruelling training – dedicated to perfecting their craft.Good surfers know that catching the best waves is an art – it comes down to positioning and wave choice. It isn’t always easy to guess what the shape of the reef is and then position yourself just outside where the sets are breaking. You focus on the horizon, trying to judge the lumpy swell from shadows and when you see one, you paddle for the horizon as fast as you can. In startups the same logic applies, you need to understand the mechanisms which drive the trends, watch users behaviour and position your idea in the right community at exactly the right time.In the water you’re constantly taking calculated risks - it is not possible to take every wave. If you tried, you’d end up paddling in circles and catching nothing. Instead it is sometimes better to spend time sitting further out back and wait for the bigger sets. Then when you pick your wave, you go for it with everything you have. You paddle like your life depends on it. Hesitancy here can translate to losing skin on the reef below. Equally, in startups, it is essential to take the time to understand the problem you are solving and then be willing to commit to the idea with everything you have.If you paddle out into the ocean when insanely big sets are rolling in, you expect to take a pounding every once in a while. But it can be amazingly liberating knowing that you’ve taken the biggest pounding possible and yet you’re still alive. This inspires confidence because you no longer have anything to be afraid of. Likewise, the most innovative companies design systems which plan for failure not success. Life in a startup is a constant process of failing, picking yourself up, reflecting on what you learnt from your mistakes, and then forging ahead in new directions.— Bruce LeeSurfing teaches you to be present. The first dive under the whitewash is invigoratingly painful. Not for a prescribed period of time, but as a friend once said, “for an eternity of moments”. You catch a reflection of the morning sun. It brings your focus to the present and reduces you to a state of inarticulate wonder. As Mickey Smith says it is ‘Sure there’s nothing wrong with going solo, but driving 8 hours and scoring perfect waves is all the more incredible when you can share the joy with the people that mean the most to you. I can’t yet claim to know about success in startups yet, but I would imagine it is all the sweeter if you can share it with people you care about and who have shared the highs and lows on the road to get there.Do what you love with relentless passion and trust that your hard work will eventually pay off in the end. To close, I think there is a lot of truth in the old saying that the journey is more important than the destination.Cofounder 

The great thing about startups is that they get s**t done. There is no time to pontificate, no budget to bring in McKinsey and plenty of uncertainty and risk that entrepreneurs grow to be comfortable with. This context has created a way of working that powers startups to innovate at internet speed and disrupt most industries in their wake.We call this way of working ‘Lean Startup’ — a discipline which accepts that a startup doesn’t know all the answers when it begins and must deliberately discover the mechanics that will cause it to succeed. Great businesses never lose this habit.Done well, lean startups massively de-risk the chance of failure and build conditions that lead to rapid, efficient scale. This is not just for social networks and e-commerce sites. Businesses all over the world are using this process to launch broadband networks, develop pharmaceutical drugs and create new energy solutions.A government can become a leading practitioner of innovation not just an organisation that makes policy around it. Consider Tesla. Arguably a startup with government scale ambition, Tesla has built, measured and learned its way from a pilot (testing the battery tech in a Lotus car) to a company that intends lead the replacement fossil fuel across the world.Why aren’t governments doing this?Lean startup tells us to get out there and do something, then measure what happens. Governments consult and fund huge thought experiments carried out on paper. What if governments ran programs that tried things in a small way and measure how they helped people. Then learned how to scale them. Policy can be developed using lean principles. Instead of asking experts what they think, what if governments actually made what they imagined and asked their citizens to try it?What if we tried to run a whole town on solar power and batteries? What if we ran experiments learning how people’s routines changed and what new businesses could form? What could we learn? What if we gave a whole school population $1,000 in bitcoins and configured a whole town to accept payments? What could we learn? What if we gave everyone in a GP surgery an iPhone and experimented with a 100% electronic health service? Can we make people healthier? Can we reduce health costs?The first human genome took 10 years and $1.5 billion to sequence and now it takes 24 hours and costs $1,000. Within a decade, each adult in the world will have computing power equivalent to a human brain. We haven’t invented 99% of the inventions, opportunities, businesses and jobs that are before us. It is time to stop protecting the past and look to the future. Embrace the startup way and step into a prosperous, extrardinary future.What do you think Phil is the CEO and Co-Founder of Pollenizer, which builds incubation and acceleration programs for big companies using ‘startup science’.

Bir İstanbul startup community denemesidir.Merhaba yeniden.Daha önce part 1ini yazdığım; bir toplu startup denemesinin ikinci kısmıyla karşınızdayım. İlk kısmı okumayanları İlk yazının ardından yüksek yüzdeyle olumlu, çok düşük bir yüzdeyle ise olumsuz tepkiler aldım. Olumsuz tepkilerden en sevdiğimi sizinle de paylaşmak isterim.Bunun yanı sıra oldukça mutlu eden ve övgü dolu da tepkiler vardı. Değerli katkıları için sırasıyla Ayrıca mail atarak, facebooktan mesaj yollayarak bu projenin içerisinde olmak istediğini, her türlü katkıyı sunacağını söyleyen arkadaşlara da ayrı ayrı teşekkür ederim. İşler biraz daha ciddiye binince güzel şeyler olacak bence.Gelen sorulara cevapları yazının sonuna saklıyorum.Güzel derslerden biri şu: eğer “Gelelim zurnanın zırt dediği yere. Bir önceki yazıda konuştuğumuz gibi Persona’larla devam ediyoruz. Bildiğiniz gibi talkers ve stalkers olmak üzere iki tip kullanıcımız vardı. Bu kullanıcılar için ayrı ayrı persona çalışmaları yaptım. Talkers için 4 adet, Stalkers için ise 3 adet persona çıktı.Ruşen’in kim olduğu malumunuz diye düşünüyorum. Ruşen bizim için önemli, çünkü aslında elimizdeki en kaliteli içeriği muhtemelen o sağlayacak. Ruşen’i mutlu etmenin yolu, onu küstürmemek. Teknolojiden uzak olduğu için, talker’ların kullandığı app’i oldukça basit kullanılır yapmalıyız. Çok fazla fonksiyon içermeden, amacına uygun olmalı. Üstelik Ruşen’in seyirciyle bağlantısı çok kritik. Kimin sevip sevmediğinden çok; gelebilecek yan sorularla ilgileniyor.Melek bir başka prototipimiz. Muhtemelen kendini tekrarlayan içerikler sunacak fakat uygulamanın trendy olması en çok Melek’e bağlı. Melek’i mutlu etmenin en kolay yolu ise, uygulamada ona has bir şeyler olduğunu hissettirmek olacak. Artık bunu avatar’la mı yaparız, yoksa kişisel ileti ile mi bilmiyorum ama Melek şu ana kadar yaptıkları bilinsin ve hayranlarına hayran eklensin istiyor. Konuşulacak konuyu genelde Melek belirliyor.Hakan’ı tek kelimeyle özetleyecek olursak “BAŞARILI” olurdu bu. Sektöründe ciddi etkisi olduğunu düşündüğünden kendi fikirlerini, ona sorulacak soruları cevaplamayı istiyor Hakan. Fakat ürünümüze alacağımız en önemli insight; Hakan hatayı sevmiyor. Gördüğü ekranlarda eğer kalitesizlik sezerse, o anda çıkar gider o ortamdan. Zira kendisine yakışanı giymek gibi bir hastalığı var. Eleganlık, onun ruhunda.Şaziye daha çok bizim mass kitleye gittiğimizde ihtiyacımız olacak prototip. O ancak uygulama belli bir popülerliğe geldiğinde kullanır. Sonsuz basitlik onun için en önemli kriter. Onun konuşmalarını kaç kişi dinliyor, kaç kişi beğeniyor görmelidir. Mümkünse; diğer Şaziye’leri de bilmelidir. Çünkü gerçek Şaziye odur. Competition dürtüsüyle platformda yer alır ve kazanmak için bir çok ekstrem şey yapabilir.Bu personamızın adına da Hakan demem tam bir talihsizlik. Hakan kitabi bir “early innovator”dır. Her şeyin yenisini Hakan’da bulmak mümkündür. Eğer bir de tükettiği şeyden anlatacak hikaye çıkarabilirse değmeyin Hakan’ın keyfine. Ufak problemlere aldırış etmeyecektir, ama eğer Hakan’dan geribildirim isterseniz ve onun söylediklerini hayata geçirirseniz ondan sadık kullanıcınız olmaz. Sosyal ortamlarda güçlü bir etkisi olduğu için uygulamanın yayılmasına doğrudan etki eder.Gözde’yi sosyal medyadaki çocuksu isyanlarından tanırsınız. Örnek aldığı isim Melek’tir, ama her yerde Melek’i kötülemekten de kendini alamaz. Çok farklı arkadaş grupları vardır ve paylaşmayı sever. Onun için en önemli konu içeriğe hızlıca ulaşabilmesi ve kolaylıkla paylaşabilmesidir. Paylaştıklarından geri dönüş bekler. Talker olsa binlerce kişinin onu dinleyebileceğini düşünmektedir.Mehmet en hakikisinden idealisttir. Çok fazla paylaşmaz ama mutlaka dahil olmak ister muhabbetlere. İçeriğin kalitesi onun için çok önemlidir. Hangi konuyla ilgileniyorsa o içeriğe ulaşmak ister, anasayfasında Şaziye’yi gördüğü gün uygulamayı silecektir. Fakat onun için bir onaylama mekanizması yaratılırsa ve kendini böyle ifade edebilirse uygulamanın sadık kullanıcılarından biri olacaktır.Her persona aslında uygulamanın çeşitli tarafları için güzel öngörüler sağladı. Çalışmanın bu yönüyle amacına ulaştığını söyleyebilirim.Bundan sonraki adımımız Wireframelerin çizilmesi olacak. Şu noktadan itibaren gerçekten bir UX designer’a ve Tasarım desteğine ihtiyaç duyuyorum. Kendi öngörülerim dışında, personalardan tanıdığınız varsa ve bir şekilde ulaşmamı sağlarsanız en büyük katkıyı vermiş olacaksınız.— Tabii ki bizim gibi girİŞimcilerin aklına gelen ilk soru “nasıl para kazanılır?”.Uzun bir süre bu işten para kazanılmayacağı aşikar. Uygulamanın “talker”larından ötürü ilk etapta run rate yüksek olabilir. Bunu önlemek için Ruşen’e gitmeli ve tanıdık vasıtasıyla Hakan’ı konuşturmalı. Kullanıcı kitlesi 10K+ olduğunda “sponsored ürün” incelemeleri enteresan bir deneyim olabilir. Kullanıcı kitlesi 100K+ olduğunda ise kimseyi üzmeyen bir reklam modeline geçilir. İçeriğe göre ürünün lafı muhabbet içerisinde geçebilir.— Diğer bir soru ise tavuk mu yumurtadan çıkar, yumurta mı tavuktan?Bu soru yıllardır beni delirtiyor. Ne yapmak istediğine göre değişir. Haşlama tavuk istiyorsan, bekleyeceksin, tavuk yumurtadan çıkacak; onu horozlara bulaştırmayacaksın; sebat edeceksin. Omlet yapmak istiyorsan tavuğun kıçına konsantre olacaksın. Horozsuz bir dönemde yumurtalar zaten tavuksuz olur.Bizim durumumuzda da yumurtaları tavuklar çıkaracak ve horoza bulaşmayacağız. Tavukları bulmak için de sizden yardım istiyorum. İlk örnek tavuklar, kullanıcı kitlesinin olmadığını bilmesine rağmen içerik dolduracak. Uygulamayı ilk indiren stalker’ın dahil olabileceği 20+ chat zaten hali hazırda yapılıyor olacak.— Kimse yok mu böyle bir şey yapan?Evet, hakikatten henüz 1–1 aynı işi yapan birilerini duymadım. Serkan Ünsal’ın önerisiyle YouNow’ı inceledim ama benim hitap etmek istediğim ihtiyaca cevap değil. Eğer bildiğiniz böyle ürünler varsa paylaşmanızdan mutluluk duyarım.Geldik Part 2nin de sonuna. Projeye dahil olmak isteyen, katkı sunmak isteyen herkesi bekliyorum. Ama UX Designer ve Tasarımcıysanız ekstra ekstra bekliyorum :). Hala okumamış, birlikte yapmaya çalıştığımız deneyi bilmeyen kişiler için yazıyı paylaşmanız, hatta “Recommend” etmeniz süper olur!Cevaplarınızı, önerilerinizi bekliyorum!iletişim için;Twitter: Email: aykutb @ outlook.comgecenin sonuna yolcu.Gelecek aklında ilerle.

Many large organizations are now looking at how they can generate new growth by launching new adjacent startups or business units. Skunkworks teams, corp incubators, and product development agencies are buzzing — trying to disrupt themselves before being disrupted.However, all startups are not born equal nor have the same objectives.At There are in general many embedded dynamics that make these ventures unlike what you might see amongst more traditional startups. Here are a four tips on areas to consider if you are building a startup associated with a big company:Finally, get going! Venture creation is risky and filled with mostly unknowns. In a corporate environment, those are traits that nobody enjoys. However, if you are the one tasked with innovation you should take responsibility for getting started.

Between working with students and business partners, learning the ropes of the startup world, and working to resolve issues affecting premature infants and food and beverage production companies (respectively) at his two companies, Mills certainly has a lot on his plate. But somehow, he manages to balance it all and unearth some valuable lessons — on networking, leadership and the future of food — along the way. Mills’ work as an educator doesn’t end in the classroom; when we spoke with him, he passed on some of these lessons and more — including the key factor that got one of his startups off the ground.Mills received his Ph.D. in Microbiology from the University of Minnesota in 1995.

When my co-founder, Derek, and I sat down to start Culture bleeds right into our product, our relationships with customers, and our potential impact on the world. How can it not?We started the process of building our company culture early on — before we hired any employees — by writing down our desired values. This was a great start, but actually expressing these values everyday is difficult. I’ll strive to articulate how we chose our core values and how they became engrained in our culture as we grew.While working on our last startup, Derek and I often spent long lunches discussing what we were ‘hacking’ in our lives: the latest diet, workout, productivity system, or leadership technique.We loved this discussion and mutual support so much that we brought together a close group of four friends, quarterly, for a long, candid conversation about our lives, our aspirations, and how we can make progress.One of the most important pieces of reading Ive ever done is the Core Message: Netflix trusts people to be responsible — and hence increases their freedom as much as possible.I read those key pages while the culture of my last company was imploding. Business complexity had grown — and freedom had been drastically curtailed. Suddenly we were tracking vacation days, implementing a nonsensical snow day policy, and generally sucking the life out of the place as a result.Freedom is nice — but without these systems nothing much would get done!I used to be a bit of an asshole. You could count on me to barely listen when you were speaking (too busy planning my rebuttal), bulldoze your suggestions (mine were better!), ignore your emotions (and be unaware of mine.) This lack of kindness and respect in communications made me almost impossible to work with.But those who could ignore or work around my failings found a gem in my communication style. I was always direct and to the point — I gave real reactions and feedback when they were used to folks dissembling in various ways.I believed that the directness I so valued was in direct conflict with kindness and respect.My co-founder Derek had the opposite communication style. Kindness and respect was paramount. You could count on Derek to be empathetic, to be a good listener, and to have amazing insight into personal relationships.But when being direct ran the risk of ruffling feathers — Derek would avoid the rough conversations and maintain decorous relationships at all costs.Derek had come to the same conclusion: directness was in conflict with kindness and respect — but had chosen the opposite side of the table.Having the chance to work together so closely has led us to a different conclusion. We wholly reject the notion that directness lies in conflict to kindness and respect. In fact — Directness  Kindness/Respect We’re working to take this insight into the heart of our culture. We strive consistently to achieve both … unlike our other values — there arent as many clear bullet-points for how weve built systems to express this value. There should be and will be more — ideas welcome!As weve grown Change Collective from just the founders into a real company, weve been constantly re-thinking how we articulate and live our values.Each addition to the Change Collective team (Joel, Jim, Maroun, Edwina, Brent, and Rob so far!) has contributed greatly — and we look forward to years of additions + modifications!Being thoughtful about our values has been well worth the effort — best of luck bringing together yours!Co-founder of Change Collective — courses for change with world-class experts.Improving our lives through behavior change is a fundamental human desire. Let’s make it easier.

If you are doing a startup, just starting as a side-project or profitable and on its way to unicorndom, as a founder you are bound to encounter many advisors on your journey. These interactions come in unstructured and structured ways: the coffee with a friend of a friend who’s an exec at a Fortune 500 to an entrepreneur who is a formal advisor on your board. They come with different names as advisors, partners, mentors or just friend.Over the last decade, I’ve had my fair share of advice received. I’d say I had more than 1,000 lunches, dinners, coffee, drinks or plain meetings with advisors. There is no certification or requirement to be an advisor. When people seek you to give an advice, you become an advisor. There is one commonality among all advisors: they don’t have to live with the consequences of their advice. That’s why they are different from employees. Employees (you and your team) need to actually take the advice, make it happen, live with it and if it fails, you can’t blame anyone but you. Advisors, on the other hand, never get the blame, as it probably should be, and, worst of all, don’t have to live with it.Mentor whiplash is a real thing and you can read this Being on the receiving end of that whiplash (and probably on the sending end as well), I can tell you there are three types of mentors you’ll encounter. Each provide their own value, and possibly the same person might personify more than one type in a single meeting, but being able to identify which type of advisor you are talking to will help you do a better job at understanding the true value of that advice.(Despite the fact that I use gender stereotypes on the categorization of advisors, this is not about gender)The Dad has the answers. He knows best. He’ll tell you exactly what you need to do and when. He’s the one who sees you drilling a hole in the wall and yells from the other side of the room “That’s nowhere the hole should go, it should go here” and he grabs the drill from your hand, drills it and breaks a pipe.He’s more experienced than you and by the sheer nature of his experience he has to know best, right? That’s the person that will give you answers, even when you asked no questions yet. He (or she) will tell you how to run your business, how to price your product, which features to add, who you should hire and which partnership to pursue with no lack of confidence.The Mom won’t give you answers. She’ll ask you questions. She’s like a therapist that knows if she tells you what she thinks without you being prepared to hear it you might take it at face value or you might ignore it completely.The Mom Advisor will help you figure out a framework to find the answer. She will help you decide what’s the best way to prove or disprove a hypothesis. She will answer most of the question with “On the other hand, with the simple stuff, she’ll give it to you straight. Don’t cheat, be happy, follow your heart, be kind, eat your vegetables. She knows the simple stuff just needs to be taken care of and dwelling on it won’t make or break your business. Need payments? Use Stripe. Need Retention Analytics? Mixpanel. Where to store source code? Github. Sure, there are dozens of options, and her answer on those won’t be wrong because they won’t make or break your startup. She knows exactly when she’ll give it straight (when it doesn’t matter) or she’ll help you find the answer (when it does matter).Ah, the Grandpa Advisor. We like them so much we’ll even pay to listen to them talk. That’s the advisor that instead of giving you answers (Dad-type) or asking you questions (Mom-type), will tell you a story. It’s their personal war story. Sometimes (always?) a little embellished, but what a good story it is. You ask them about your Series A round strategy and they spend 30-minutes telling their story of raising that Series A. In the end, it might not even have any direct value or relation to what you need, but you’ll love it anyway. And talking with advisors like that, a picture starts to paint itself right in front of you.When Ben Horowitz wrote (Side note to event organizers: If you want to create a successful conference, let speakers tell a personal story that relates to the conference topic.)If there is one thing that we can all learn from religion, is just plain advice or life-lesson (business-lesson) doesn’t work. It has to be embedded within a narrative, a human story that we can relate to, directly (empathetically) or indirectly (sympathetically).Entrepreneur, builder  technologist.

On May 29–31, we will be bringing together more than 125 hackers, designers, and hustlers from all different nationalities for the first-ever Immigration-themed Startup Weekend hackathon event, aka The most frequent question we’ve gotten has been, “What kind of ideas will attendees work on?”There are so many problematic areas of Immigration that could benefit from the talent and creativity of Silicon Valley. Not only that, Immigration in the US is such a minefield of complexity that it’s difficult to know much beyond your own unique situation, or that of your friends.That’s why we’re providing this list of Immigration Startup Ideas. You definitely don’t have to work on an idea on this list — It’s mostly here to help stimulate you to think about all the different ways you can go about creating a more even playing field for immigrants. Our hope is that someone who’s been itching to work on an idea in one of these areas will consider attending our hackathon, but we’d also love for you to show up on Friday and surprise us with an idea we haven’t even thought of.We’ve divided the list of potential ideas into 4 “life stages” of immigration, which closely mirror that of a startup. After all, immigrants and founders have more in common than you might think — Both refuse to accept the status quo, both are taking a risk that most other people aren’t willing (or able) to take, and both are ready to sacrifice everything to make their dream a reality.Here is the list (we’ll add to it over time) of some areas we’re particularly interested in:If you’d like to help solve some of these longstanding problems, join us on Friday May 29th at Hungry and Foolish.

About two months ago, we set on a mission to show the world what is the definition of “success” in different countries. We used a very simple metric for that — the size of the biggest internet companies built in these countries. The goal was to show that even given very similar market conditions, population size and geographical location, the size of the companies that can be built varies significantly. We hope that by using this data, people can have realistic expectation of the level of “success” they can achieve in their country.In order to collect this data, we reached out to WSR community members all over the world. In many cases, the top internet companies were public, which made our job of validating the data straightforward. In other cases, we based companies’ valuation on news related to their recent investments, acquisition talks, revenue numbers, etc. In the case of private companies where little or no information was available, we turned to our community members who often are connected with the key personnel in the relevant companies. These people shared private data with us to support this research, and in return we treated their data with utmost confidentiality. It was challenging to sometimes accept data without a second source to double check, but we made the decision to trust our community because they are often the best people to provide this information.Iran proved to be the latter case. Hardly any information was available online. However, we had one knowledgeable source of information which we ended up relying on. When The debate became so intense it ended up splitting this young ecosystem in half. In one entrepreneur’s words:What was really frustrating was that the arguments in the community were more personal than fact-driven. While many folks complained, no one was able to give us any solid data to support their claim, even worse, no one could help us put together the correct data.We were in a bind.With the time running out and pressure mounting, we agreed with The Economist’s tough decision to remove Iran from our global research. We swallowed our pride and admitted to The Economist that Iran data is too controversial at this point to remain on the publication. It was a very sad moment for us, but much more so for the community because Iran rarely gets this level of international coverage on their startup ecosystem. And the one time they finally received it, it was forced to be removed.The story didn’t end there. We saw how passionate these Iranian entrepreneurs were and we had a feeling that if we just had a single unified cause, we could unite them and push this community to a higher level. Getting removed from The Economist was exactly the spark that this community needed.What we did in the next 48 hours should serve as a guide on how communities can be united, no less than it should be a guide for our peers on how to get back up when fallen to the ground. Instead of rewriting the story again, we’ll share 3 emails that started and ended this journey. We highly recommend you to read and learn from our experience.While a degree of secrecy is necessary to compete, opaque ecosystems suffer from a lack of recognition and friction, communication, investment and business. It’s a tragedy of the commons.The Economist’s stance provided the spark that brought a healthy amount of transparency to the Persian ecosystem, putting it officially on the world map. It should also lubricate the flow of information in the country’s ecosystem, allowing it to thrive. We hope this remarkable example of a joint effort will inspire others!————————————————————————————————hello [@] worldstartupreport.comWorld Startup Report is a social project to help understand and connect the startup ecosystems worldwide.

Vor 6 Monaten habe ich meinen sicheren, spannenden und gut bezahlten Job bei einer der grössten Digital-Agenturen der Schweiz gekündigt und meine Anteile verkauft. Ich habe mich entschlossen, meinem unternehmerischen Drang mehr Freiraum zu geben und die Komfort-Zone zu verlassen.Warum das? Tja. Ist gar nicht so einfach, das in 2 Sätze zu fassen. Aber wenn ich rückblickend nochmals darüber nachdenke, ging es am Ende des Tages im Kern wohl darum, dass es ab einer gewissen Unternehmensgrösse schwierig wird, Unternehmer im Unternehmen zu bleiben und nicht zum “Manager” zu konvertieren. Diese schleichende Metamorphose ist in der operativen Hektik manchmal schwierig zu erkennen, aber trotzdem in vielen Fällen Fakt. Wenn man sich zwischendurch mal ausklinkt und über alles in Ruhe nachdenkt, hat man die Chance zu erkennen, dass man irgendwo angekommen ist, wo man eigentlich nicht hatte sein wollen. Das ist dann der Anfang vom Neu-Anfang.So war es zumindest bei mir. Und jetzt sitze ich seit 2 Monaten in einem kleinen Office an einem grossen IKEA-Tisch, zusammen mit Roger und Josip. Wir versuchen gemeinsam Nicht nur die schnelle, direkte und unkomplizierte Arbeit an realen Dingen, auch der andere Teil meines Lebens ist durch den Change spannender geworden. Zum Beispiel der Mental Shift in Bezug auf Geld: Sparen im “Everyday Life” ist wieder angesagt, da der Fixlohn im StartUp logischerweise viel tiefer ist. Und man glaubt es kaum: Meine Frau Ruth und ich haben Spass daran. Hätte ich mir so vorher auch nicht gedacht ;)So gesehen gibt es aus meiner Sicht bisher absolut nichts zu bereuen. Und ich möchte Gleichgesinnte, welche heute in “sicheren” Management-Rollen sind, ermutigen, über Ihre Situation nachzudenken und sich zu überlegen, im Rahmen der jeweiligen finanziellen Möglichkeiten die Komfort-Zone zu verlassen. Man kann es z.B. auch als Projekt für ein Jahr sehen. Das lässt sich im Übrigen auch Zuhause einfacher vermarkten ;)Es ist nämlich ein wenig wie beim Fallschirmspringen:Zeit, etwas Neues zu starten. Why Not?PS: Hier noch ein 2 Links zu Texten/Präsentationen, über welche ich auf dem Weg mal gestolpert, und die ich bis heute nicht mehr losgeworden bin.Father of 3 daughters, CEO at Frontify, Inventor of sakku, Digital Addict

I have advised and helped a bunch of entrepreneurs the past few years in their fundraisings or operations. Not easy to be a good/valuable advisor if you absolutely try to play it smart while you should not. I’ve recently learnt to accept my position and my role and put together those 10 rules that, in my humble opinion, every advisor should live by. He or She:Last but not least, a good advisor never ever puts his stake into consideration when advising an entrepreneur.Partner at Kima Ventures | Nurturing European Entrepreneurs w/ Education, Unfair Advantages and Capital

For most of the world, Athens (capital of Greece, home to nearly 50% of Greece’s population) in 2012 was synonym to words like crisis, debt, IMF, austerity, corruption and unemployment. The economic and social reality on the ground was/is harsh and it affected everyone one way or another. Everyone talked about the cuts, bankruptcies, new taxes, lack of political leadership, insecurity and so on.The Greek business community was very ill prepared for such a hit and had nothing to hold on to. Athens (and Greece for that matter) had and still has no headquarters of multinationals or globally leading tech businesses that would spur growth/innovation around them. It has only a handful tech focused entrepreneurs.So if you combine the above with the fact that in a country of 11 millionIn addition to that, on the consumer side, only By 2012 the first few Athenian startup founders had already moved forward with the creation of the first products. They were the only examples of people starting in this chaotic Greek environment and creating something that had some value.So we all wanted to learn from their mistakes. (Some leading examples being: We are in Q4 of 2012 and it’s time for the second generation of Athenian startups to surface. We find our selves in Colab Some founders had read We all kept reading everything on We reach 2013, the gates have opened and Athens flooded with “startups”  startup-related professionals. New co-working spaces, incubators, accelerators, private equity funds, VCs, angels, meetups, private meetups, networking events, media, advisors, mentors and basically anyone who could convince he or she was worth having a startup-related title also came along.That brought unbelievable levels of bullshit in the air, making it difficult for us newbies in the beginning to distinguish those who had value from the rest. It quickly became obvious though.Yey! we have an alpha (fail) version! It’s not fail because it’s alpha, it’s fail because we have no idea what exactly is the value we want to create and for whom, how to do it etc.None of the founders had any prior experience in developing a global tech product (no ex-Google or ex-Apple employees here), putting it to market and testing it, so we didn’t even realize what we needed to do for testing or how we could do an MVP, this is why I used the term alpha.Eric Ries’ lean startup model is great when you read it, but when you try to apply it, all your perceptions and preconceptions mess it up, and you end up asking the answer in the question. Yet, you don’t see it.As months passed the ecosystem bullshit has grown. Before having achieved anything, simply for starting up in the chaotic environment of Greece, the Greek and global media portray us as At that point the ecosystem’s dilution with startup-wannabes (in my humble opinion) has hit an all times high.Being presented in the media became something of a hobby. Every week or two, some of us either independently or together with other founders would be on TV, on major radio stations, on national newspapers and news websites/blogs you name it! And we became also frequent speakers at events taking place in Athens (for no particular reason).Later on in 2014, we were even invited to speak at events of the two major political parties and to meet Angela Merkel (the German Chancellor and most influential European politician) at a private session with our Prime Minister They then continued inviting us in closed door meeting with Ambassadors from 50+ countries to Greece, and special missions for Greek exporters…along with orange and olive oil producers Back to 2013, funding time has come and we are looking to raise funding in order to move forward. Most of us are running on borrowed or personal money which is ending soon and there is quite some anxiety.Some of us manage to raise early funding from the two Greek tech startup funds of that time (It was a new weird thing, both for us and for the people at the funds.Looking back it, I think we all tried to simulate the “Silicon Valley best practices and standards”, while neither of the two had any similarity to the Valley’s equivalent. We are so far from the Valley in so many ways, and it was just weird…The two funds mentioned above are financed 70% by the European Investment Fund in Luxembourg and 30% by private mainly Greek investors.So it’s largely public money they were investing in us. That didn’t make any of us happy, but for the first time it was being given as equity through investment and not for free via pointless EU programs as it happened until now.Greece has had a tragic experience with EU programs and financing, as well as regional and local “Funds for Development”. Wrong political decisions and wrong implementation at EU level, combined with record high Greek corruption and incompetence, led to a chaos. That started from 1981 when Greece joined the EU and probably is still happening until today, although I don’t know the details, I only hear what is being said by people who are involved in such activities.By now, around 6–7 startup founders — among the funded ones — have formed the The credit for this goes to the founders of Locish (It failed. The founders now started Although we didn’t care how other saw us, we were an integral part of the startup hype for few months. We were the first wave of multiple (small) investments that happened in Greece in a short period of time and with all the publicity, it made a splash.We are now in deep beta and we are super happy as we are getting early traction. Some of us with more robust beta products, others with much less, anyway the numbers are not yet that important.As time passes product  business decisions become harder and harder. Our skill sets start not being enough, and the beta success for those of us who had it, makes us feel like we jumped from a plane and we are trying to create our parachute while falling…as Funded founders (seed and above) generally tend to be fairly clever  skilled people. Some more, others less, but in general they have what it takes to build something and convince someone to give them an important amount of money for it.This is why funded founders represent a tiny % of the population of developed countries. In Greece, what most people lack though is what I would call “context”. For building a great tech product you need to understand how products are built, I mean the tools, methods, techniques and approaches everyone uses in the world’s leading tech companies, when trying to build a tech product.In an ecosystem like Greece where basically no one (apart from… 4 people) has done it, no one has the slightest idea of how it can be done, so being a new startup founder in this ecosystem is like if you are…trying to learn how to drive (for the first time) at the F1 Grand Prix Final Race.With all this push, and massive new programs supporting startups, new startup awards (we also won a 5.000 EUR award — Get In The Ring competition), still the new Greek startups that I hear about are as lost we all were.If the Greek (or any other) startup ecosystem which lacks 100% “context”, hopes to succeed (=exits  IPOs), it must first of all understand it will take 20 years of failures, and that the stats about startup success rates won’t represent 15% of all companies started, as most people say in tech.It will be more like 0,1% or 0,5% for the first 10–15 years and this should be seen as normal. It won’t solve the unemployment problem, it will need to attract foreign talent and it may push several companies to relocate some or all of their resources at some point outside Greece.It can’t be done only from within (i.e. only Greeks in Greece without global tech experience) as we all need external input from people who have done it before.Having said all that, if you are planning to start in any place apart from the Valley, London or maybe Berlin, Founder of Keepwit / Helping founders and teams on sales acceleration / Previously founded a $480k funded SaaS startup, and 2 companies 

You could say it’s been a New Year’s 2015 started us out literally on top of the world, after Many people called us fakes—and worse—after no official word came through from Google HQ regarding this stunning surprise acquisition, their first of 2015. We waited and wondered ourselves what this could mean, until suddenly we received an We tried to reason with them, but we are just a young struggling startup, and their lawyers beat ours in a very complicated metaphorical arm-wrestling match.So we announced that we would be buying back our company, with your help, via a The digital ink was barely dry on our fabulous list of rewards we were prepared to offer backers, from the $5 level on up through the $10,000 limit set by Kickstarter—when suddenly, the phone rang.I’ve learned to hate the sound of my phone ringing these past few days.I checked the caller ID, as the phone rang again, more insistently this time.It said simply:What now?Hesitating, I picked it up, expecting the familiar robot voice, flinching in anticipation.“Hello, is this Early Clues?” a warm, boyish voice bubbled.“That depends…” I responded, warily.Probably another tech fanboy trying to ‘figure out’ what our service was or get to the bottom of our original acquisition price.“Ha ha,” the voice didn’t skip a beat. “Listen, it’s Z—”“Z?” I said flatly. No bells were ringing.“Zuck?”“Er, I don’t think we want any,” I said, about to hang up.“As in Mark Zuckerberg…” he was laughing, seemingly without a care in the world.“…”I couldn’t respond.He went on, unprompted.“Look, we watched your video—the one with the robot…”“Oh right,” I said blankly, “the robot.” I stared off at my brand new 2015 Z continued, “Don’t bother hitting submit on that Kickstarter form.”“How did you know I was about to hit submit on our Kickstarter campaign?” I asked, nervously.“Ha ha, you’re logged into Facebook, aren’t you?”“…maybe,” I said, worried about the implications.“Anyway, it doesn’t matter. We’re prepared to help you.”“How?”“By bailing you out.”“Listen, Mr. Zuckerberg. I’m sure you mean well, but—”He wouldn’t let me continue.“I know, you’re worried about the same thing happening again with us as happened with our competitor.”“That’s right. We think we’d rather stay independent, you know. Cut our own firewood and all that...”“I hear ya, I hear ya,” he sounded so, confoundingly “Look, we’re not like our competitors. We’re “You’re open?”“Yeah, Facebook’s mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected. People use Facebook to stay connected with friends and family, to discover what’s going on in the world, and to share and express what matters to them.”“I’ve read the press releases, Z…” It’s me who was feeling “But how does Early Clues fit into all that?”“It’s your technology, see…” his characteristic bravado sounded “You don’t know what we do,” I started. “Isn’t that right?”It was contagious. I started laughing too.I glanced up at the cute kitten for “I have to admit, I don’t,” Z offered.“And you’re okay with that?”“Of course I want to know,” he said. “Doesn’t everyone?”“And you’re prepared to spend “Whatever it takes. Money is no object. You’ve piqued my personal curiosity. This is bigger than business for me now. Name a figure…”It would more than cover our original purchase price, our lawyers’ fees, our Kickstarter campaign, the value of the free coupon books we’d been offered…“Done,” he said.I sighed.The kitten on the calendar looked like he might just regain his grip.“Listen, my people are already working on the details. Press releases have already gone out. A drone is on its way to deliver your “Let me guess, free coupon books we can use on your corporate campus?”“You’ll see,” he told me. Somehow managing to add a “So I guess you’ll be wanting to find out our secret product then, right?”“I know it may not sound like it, but I’m a patient man. It will come out when the time is right…”“Hold on a second, if you knew I was about to hit ‘submit’ on our Kickstarter campaign, that probably means you can see all the activity on my computer—probably all our computers—all our network traffic, etc.”“Ha ha, I can’t confirm or deny that officially. But like I said, we’re a very “What I don’t get, is if you basically have x-ray vision inside of our company, why don’t you already know everything there is to know about our product?”“Ahhh…” He sounded more serious, almost meditative even. Like a zen master who had just heard a pupil’s response to a particularly deep “That is the question, isn’t it?”A very good question indeed.I waited for a response.“I believe in the power of the Great Mystery,” he finally said, cryptically.“What is that supposed to mean? That doesn’t answer my question remotely.”I began to doubt the deal I had just agreed to.Just then, the doorbell rang.I saw Richard get up to answer it.With some kind of wrapped gift basket.“You and I worship at the same altar,” Z broke the silence.“You mean, technology?”He laughed a hearty long laugh.“No,” he said, “what’s “And what is it you think is I wasn’t in the mood to play games.“The Mystery.”“The Mystery?”“Money can buy anything,” he said. “But it can’t buy the “I’m pretty sure you’re trying to The kitten was slipping.It was him who sighed now.“Look,” he said. “I don’t want to know. I want to “That’s a very peculiar position for someone who just spent the money you did to buy our company.”I could see Richard, Roger and the others gathering around the Should I stop them?Call up the drone and send it back?Suddenly, the stress of the past nine days collapsed to a single point.“I’m done,” I told him, finally certain of myself again — for the first time since 2014.“I’m getting out of the business,” I announced.Z sounded ecstatic, then, asking like a delighted child who had just found a play buddy, “Do you want to join my book club?”The kitten waved at me.Richard and the others, in the background, had opened the I hung up the phone, and went over to join them.Leveraging Infinite Growth

Hace ya un tiempo que sigo de cerca temas relacionados con Soy de la opinión que YC y las personas involucradas han creado mucho más que empresas tecnológicas exitosas: han sido responsables también de la creación de toda una cultura y maneras de pensar que muchas personas, yo incluido, encuentran sumamente valiosas para la vida personal y profesional.Desde Otra de las iniciativas de YC que seguí muy de cerca desde hace un par de años es Varias noches pasé tiempo escuchando a personas como Entonces llegó la oportunidad. Apliqué hace unos meses para la edición 2014 en Silicon Valley de Startup School junto con Tomé un vuelo a San Francisco, esa tierra mítica donde me tocó pasar algunos momentos claves de mi vida y donde tenía ya más de un año sin estar. Al día siguiente viajé hacia el sur, a Cupertino, donde se encuentra la sede del evento: el Flint Center, mismo lugar donde Steve Jobs presentó su primera Macintosh más dos décadas antes.La atmósfera del evento fue tal y como la esperaba. Se escuchaba el bullicio de las 1,700 personas invitadas mientras se registraban y tomaban bagels con queso crema antes de ingresar al auditorio. Se respiraba emoción y expectativa en el aire. La gente estaba ansiosa por comenzar a aprender cosas provenientes de los labios de aquellos y aquellas líderes intelectuales.Y entonces comenzaron las pláticas, y desfilaron por el escenario Les comparto algunos de las frases memorables que capturé, junto con reflexiones mías al respecto:Resumiendo, Startup School fue una oportunidad para mí para volver a sentarme en la silla del oyente, del pupilo, del aprendiz. Constantemente me encuentro a mí mismo participando del lado de los organizadores o participantes en conferencias y/o talleres, y había pasado una considerable cantidad de tiempo desde la última vez que me senté a escuchar.El resultado fue que, una vez más, fui inspirado por los y las ganadoras del mundo de crear cosas nuevas con tecnología. Recargué baterías y pude alimentarme de esa cultura tan rica que emana de YC y de todo el contexto que le rodea. Verdaderamente respeto a esta organización por el valor que generan en el mundo y por el efecto energizante que tienen sobre mí.Me hacen querer salir a comerme el mundo, sin importar los monumentales retos que eso conlleva. Pero más importante aún, me hacen creer que es posible comerme el mundo. Y eso vale mucho.P.S.: Encima de todo, también hubo oportunidad de ver a unos excelentes mexicanos, los de Soy hermano del mundo. 

Back in september of 2011 Eric Ries published a book that changed many of us deeply. Over the last few years, there’s been a lot of repercussion about the Lean Startup and how it applies to the Enterprise, Non-Profits and even to But there’s one thing I haven’t heard or read much about, that is the individual’s benefits from working with the So, here’s a list of principles and how they positively impact team members individually.That means What’s more important from an individual perspective, you’ll get massive opportunity for empirical learning.So, now that your manager considers you an entrepreneur, you know that you will be given autonomy.If your position is such that you don’t have a team, you will still be free to manage yourself and all your incumbencies. This is what Jason Fried calls “the manager of one”. And if you do have a team assigned, you will be allowed enough freedom to manage your team How about working in a “dogma-free” environment? Your manager is convinced that we live in a world of “extreme uncertainty”. Everything is a hypothesis that must be tested. There’s no such thing as “this is how we do things” or “because I say so”.Learning the process by which you define what needs to be learned, design the experiments, gather data to measure and draw conclusions is one of those skills that affects many aspect of your life, not just the work you are currently doing.The terms “innovation” and “accounting” are both well known and understood. However, by combining the two terms together they take on a very different meaning.By embracing the Lean Startup principles, your manager is going beyond “vanity metrics” and focusing on metrics that really matter — those metrics that speak about cause-and-effect relationships.Everyone deserves to work in an environment where leaders care about what’s really happening with the product and what can be done to make it better.Now you have a hypothesis, a product to build, and MVP of your better self. Go So, either convince your boss to change in order to embrace the Lean Startup principles OR convince yourself to change, to redirect your career.

For seven years I suffered from endometriosis. It’s a debilitating disease that attaches itself to 1 in 10 women’s reproductive system and/or other organs. … And depending on its state of growth or location inside the body can cause extreme pain. And I mean EXTREME pain.Rewind eight years ago, I was working as architect in London, cruising through life and sharing Facebook statuses of how awesome life was living abroad in the UK. However I was holding a huge secret from the people that cared about me most. I was suffering badly from a disease that was slowly starting to take over my life.What started as small irritation that a few painkillers could sort out turned into a three-day hell each month that no medication could save me from. During these three-day sessions I could not move, communicate or express emotion. This is a point of extreme pain. Only those that have experienced a pain this deep and horrific would understand. Any form of engagement or interaction intensified what was already in overdrive. The only way the body could try to expel the pain from the system was via vomiting and/or diarrhoea (delightful!).Interestingly enough, as soon as the three-day session was over, I was completely back to normal. As an outsider you would never know anything was wrong. I looked completely healthy and behaved like it never happened.Over seven years I learned how to mentally push through pain. Even though the pain was severe I knew that it would end at some point. I learned how to ride through it by taking my mind fully into the present. This might sound odd, but by being in the present made me feel every inch of the pain for what it was and via this method I was able to endure it.Knowing this was not a way to live forever, I decided to see what I could do about it. My doctor informed I had the symptoms of endometriosis and the only way to confirm it was via a laparoscopy. At which point if endometriosis was found, it would be scraped off the affected area. Someone scraping my insides??? My reproductive system? It did not sound right, so I started to seek alternative therapies.I tried everything. You name it! Acupuncture, Chinese Medicine, Massage, Diet, Yoga, Pilates…etcWhilst I did not find my cure or relief from the disease as a whole, I did find amazing service providers along the way who are fabulous at what they do. What may not work for one woman may work for another.Five years after my stint in London, I returned to Australia to help run my father’s business whilst he was in recovery from his own health battles. No one had ever seen me experience the three-day hell however on one evening my father and brother-in-law witnessed it in action. Seeing the concern and fear in their eyes made me realise how bad this was. I finally caved to modern medicine and technology and opted for the laparoscopy.The day of the surgery is one I will never forget. It is the day my life completely changed. I remember moments before being knocked out on surgery table. My anaesthetist was singing ‘Try’ by PINK, however what happened after surgery is most vivid. My eyes were still closed. I could hear someone moving about my bed in the recovery room. My mind felt clear and still. In a moment of clarity, I felt a warm rush of white move from my feet to my head. In that moment I knew I was about to embark on a mission that would have global impact. I was going to help women in way that I did not think possible.In January 2013 I won a Female Founder Fellowship to start a tech-company through Little did I know over 100 people applied for the program and only 28 were accepted. Only two received fellowships. Of the 28 accepted only 7 people graduated with a new tech-startup, and my business went on to receive investment.Fast forward to 2015, I am the founder and CEO of tech start-up Eternal Eve is a mobile app to help women find quality providers in beauty, health and wellness via their private yet powerful girlfriend network.I founded Eternal Eve on the core belief that all women deserve the highest quality of beauty, health and wellness and services and am now on a mission to raise the benchmark worldwide.There are 1000s of amazing individuals worldwide who have poured all their energy into becoming excellent service providers in the beauty, health and wellness sector. These are the experts that have set a benchmark — ensuring the highest level of quality service and satisfaction for patients and cliental. These are the businesses that deserve recognition and prosperity. These are the businesses that are industry leaders for others to follow.It’s interesting how a disease has helped me find clarity in my purpose.As all entrepreneurs know, there are highs and lows in setting up a new business venture (and running one for that matter). As endometriosis has trained me to mentally push through pain, I now use the same mind techniques to push through the low points in my start-up.Whilst I do not suffer from the same intensity of pain of endometriosis as encountered years ago, it is still unfortunately a disease. It can be scraped away, but it grows back. I can only hope that through the power of Eternal Eve and the girlfriend network I also personally find a way to eradicate this disease for life.

This method has gotten my startup into TechCrunch, Mashable, ABC News, Reader’s Digest, New York Magazine and countless other publications and blogs.If you’re trying to get press for your startup you’ve probably emailed all those catch-all addresses. You know, “Don’t feel bad, though, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll get press from emailing a catch-all address. It’s kind of like walking outside an office building and yelling, “HI! WILL YOU HIRE ME!” with the hope that someone will say yes. You’d have much better luck if you did your research and approached the right person, introduced yourself, worked your charm, and said, “great meeting you, I’m really interested in working here!” See the difference?Okay so you have a bunch of relevant email addresses and you’re ready to get press. Maybe you’ve thought about it and maybe you’re still thinking it, but no, you can’t write one email and BCC a bunch of journalists. This won’t get you press. Sure, it’s easy and convenient but it’s ineffective…and you’ll just end up annoying people.Don’t put too much thought into this. A few examples of subjects that have worked for me:Your subject doesn’t have to be glamorous. Just let the journalist know what you’re writing about. Most of them are getting hundreds of emails a day, the more you help them sort it, the more likely they’ll read it.Imagine you’re telling a friend at a party about your startup. Picturing it? Now write down exactly what you’d say and send it to your journalist of choice. Be quick and casual. Here are a few examples of emails that have worked for me:ororDon’ts:• Don’t write a lot. It won’t be read (trust me, I’ve made this mistake)Getting press is really a numbers game. Sometimes you’ll write an awesome email and you won’t hear back right away…or at all. That’s okay. Journalists are really busy and are constantly bombarded with tips and pitches. They also have deadlines to meet and assigned topics to write about. Sometimes your pitch will fit in perfectly and sometimes it won’t.Believe it or not, some of the best press I’ve received has been from journalists I’d emailed months prior. Suddenly they were writing about something relevant to my startup or their schedule freed up, or whatever!Good luck, you’ve got this!

Besides the above lessons that we discussed I have two general conclusions. The first is that the founders and the initial team have to have the selling attitude. Determination, persistence, motivation that brings action and sales.The second conclusion is that a startup has to build professional competence to sell. It has to learn techniques, collect know-how and employ talent that will make sales effective.Let me wish all of you great sales!early stage investing and venture coaching

Ryan Hoover started The Startup Edition — the ebook — started as a way to organize all of the knowledge from the startupedition.com newsletter in one place. A place where every entrepreneur — or aspiring entrepreneur — could learn how founders struggled with their startups and overcame adversity.As I said it before, it all started with an email.Several months ago I sent an email to Ryan Hoover asking him what he thought about turning the startupedition.com content into an ebook. If you don’t know Ryan, he was the Director of Product at When I sent that first email to Ryan I knew two things:I started to read about self publishing from Since I knew nothing about what tools to use, I followed Guy’s advice and decided to publish the ebook with Now, into the hard part.Even though the startupedition.com site was the home for all this knowledge about startups, the content was all over the internet. Every question will be answered by a member of the startup edition crew in one of their blogs. And every blog will have a format of its own. Welcome to formatting hell.At first I thought about paying someone at I wanted to publish the ebook on Amazon but I found out that you are not allowed to publish an ebook with a $0 price tag — even though I have downloaded many books for free from Amazon. I thought this would be a little bit tricky so I decided to publish the ebook on And just like that, the ebook was live.Well, first and foremost, I just wanted to see if I could do it. I’ve always As I said it before, I learned a lot from all of these founders, hackers and designers. I hope everyone that reads this ebook can learn a lot from them too.Co-fundador de 

As someone who has managed technical teams for several years, at large and small companies, I’ve received and read hundreds, maybe thousands, of emails from applicants. You certainly learn some heuristics to help identify the good ones quickly, but you also spot frustratingly common mistakes. In my experience, the most common mistake for people applying to startups, the one that has undermined the chances of some otherwise qualified candidates at If you haven’t spent any time to learn about us, and what we need, then why should we do the same for you?Every candidate that gets to an interview stage requires us to do hours of preparation, interviews, and discussion. If your introduction is generic, then I’m led to believe you’ve contacted dozens of other companies as well. If we’re going to invest our time in getting to know you, we’d like to know you’re serious about us.It’s different for bigger companies, where hiring processes involve more people, and put your information through some normalization (a huge hiring database) anyway. But at a startup, every hiring decision is so important that it takes careful consideration.Here are some specific manifestations of this problem, which you should avoid in your own communications.By, contrast here’s how you can stand out.And always include an up-to-date resume. I hope this helps some job-seekers out there!VP Engineering Building, curating, and leading great teams of people to do extraordinary things

First and foremost, I see design as solving problems in the most elegant way — good design should barely go noticed. To me there are several layers to design, but if you don’t get the basics right everything else is secondary. I believe the best design balances beauty and simplicity.In my experience they often don’t see value in investing in design, particularly early on. There’s been a culture of technology first, whereas I believe we should be taking a more people-centred approach to building products and services. Unless the thing you’re building has real value to someone, it’s just a vanity project, no matter the technology. Whilst the tide is turning, there’s still a need to educate startup founders about the competitive advantage well-designed products and services can bring. I founded a regular design meetup for startups (In CEO speak, higher revenues. It’s been proven that there’s a direct correlation between a well-designed product and loyalty. Customers that have a positive experience tend to spend more, more often and tell their friends. I see design as a direct route to free marketing through the positive word of mouth it helps to generate. People are now more savvy than they were even 5 years ago and so won’t put up with a poorly designed product or service if there’s a better alternative. In most circumstances a customer’s experience with your product or service is the main contact with your brand so it’s key to really work at this. If this creates a negative emotion, they’ll more than likely never come back.To me good design isn’t just about aesthetics or function, it’s about the emotional connection we make with the people we’re designing for. Startups have an amazing opportunity to build a loyal audience by make their customers happy (particularly early adopters), but too many focus solely on squeezing out the most from them and not giving much in return.Not necessarily, I just think of it as common sense, empathy, but I realise many entrepreneurs don’t think in the same way. Whilst many agree with the approach in principle, very few actually put their money where their mouth is and practice it fully. As startups are inherently in a state of flux, it’s key that they are in constant contact with the people using their products — their customers. Many startups lose sight of this, but the best companies realise the importance of a cycle of iterative development based on feedback from real world use. Only in this way can we create experiences that create real value for people.We find that visualisation is a great start. Many people (particularly entrepreneurs), don’t think of themselves as creative, but often it’s just a question of giving them the space and freedom to generate and share ideas. We feel the best way to communicate an idea is through sketching as it helps to reduce misunderstanding and instantly creates an something tangible to talk around.We also make a real effort to educate our clients about the value of testing early ideas or prototypes before we’ve gone too far in the development process. For startups that are new to product development this can be a learning curve. We also get clients involved in other design techniques that can aid the design process such as behavioural mapping, user stories or persona creation. We try to make these exercises fun to reduce friction and stimulate creativity.Solving real problems that matter to a particular group of people. This requires a thorough understanding of their customers and their world — who they are, what makes them tick, how they behave and how their product fits into the context of their lives. Too many startups assume people will flock to buy their product once it’s released but place too little emphasis on the real world problems that exist.I also think of copy as a key element of design, particularly on the web. Crafting a killer value proposition can help cut through a lot of noise and help the user to understand what the product or service can do for them. In terms of interface design, microcopy is also key to creating a connection with the audience.Yes. We’ve been using the lean canvas with our clients for a while now (a variation of Alex Osterwalder’s Business Model Canvas). We host an inception workshop with every new project and the canvas is our starting point for the day. It helps us to get a picture of how their idea fits into the wider business model and gets the discussion away from a prescribed solution early on. More recently we’ve created our own version At my company Generally we find that startups products and services often arise from ideas generated by the founder(s). The proposed solution is usually derived from a number of assumptions about the audience, market, etc. Entrepreneurs can, by their nature, be single-minded, so asking them to test their assumptions with other people can be a struggle for them. “But I know my customers!” can be a common response when we try and challenge a client to speak to some of them to validate their assumptions. So rather than take a design-driven approach, they adopt a ‘build it and they will come’ mentality. More often than not, they’ll learn the hard way that this is a risky business.It needs to come from the top, so it’s about education and awareness. Founders need to believe in the strategic advantage a design-driven approach can give them. The earlier they can bring in design, the more they can reap the benefits. It’s a lot harder to bring in design when a product or service has already been developed.I believe the best way to do this is either to have a designer as part of the founding team (A better understanding of what people actually want and would pay for, more empathy for their customers and their world, a way for them to communicate their uniqueness through their product or service. Technology can often be copied, design can bring in an emotion which often can’t.Yes. Sometimes sketching and paper prototyping if we want something raw to get early feedback on, but more often than not we quickly progress to interactive prototypes using either Bootstrap or our own in-house framework. We’ve found this to be the best way to quickly reach a common understanding with both our clients and their users. We try to keep discussion and documentation to a minimum and focus instead on creating artefacts to talk around.Our toolkit for any particular project could include any of the following:It depends. For our From day one. It’s been proven that the earlier design is brought on board, the greater the ROI. A good designer will want to understand both the business drivers and the needs of an audience, often if they are brought in midway through a project there’ll be a lot of backtracking going on. Good design can often be the difference between a product succeeding or failing.Sparkly optimist and man on a mission to spread entrepreneurial happiness.

Ok, I admit. I’m a sucker for fast. Always have been. Despite my penchant for speed, myIn food we glorify things that have leavened for hours, cooked for days, or fermented for weeks. We love that the ingredients are handpicked and the method of preparation is hundred years old. We like to measure things with the latest equipment, but know that love is best ingredient.So why is fast wrong? Well, fast is not wrong but the absence of love and belief. We started out in August 2012 with Dexplora — So — now you connected with your CRM saw what data is trustworthy and not. Our customers love us and our advisors praise us. What’s wrong then?We disliked the idea. We saw how the pilot customers used it: investigate the data, create a “dirty data export”, and send it to the sales reps. Some of the sales reps got hundreds of accounts to update. We were an “analytics cleaning company” —Yes, we changed (change #3). Every single one of the people we talked to laughed about trusting their CRM. Why? Well, the CRM needs more data to be useful. So, we felt we had to solve the problem not by building a better whip, but by solving the cause: In February 2013 we launched I think we gave up too quickly, but we did give up. I could write a whole post on local maxima in the startup world.We spent spring interviewing customers and realized what they asked for was away to get rid of all fields in the CRM, not just a custom UI. We went live in December after a fall of customer development with good results. In January we started sales and signed our first customer with almost 80 licences. Other pilot customers requested that we had more featueres for management. We added what management always love — charts. And happy managers we got.We did customer trials for three months. All trials started with both sales and management excited. All trials failed. The sales people didn’t like our product. We had been blinded by our beautiful and efficient user interface and committed In May 2014 The last three months have been amazing. We went from a handful new companies downloading and setting up Brisk.io every week, to about 10 companies installinf Brisk.io per week. In a couple of those companies Brisk spread to 10+ users inside.Our During the fall we will focus on keeping (and improving) this retention, growing the inflow of new users, and start converting happy users to paying users and organisations. The I wish we would have asked ourselves earlier about the I’m not saying we should be slow or not act. But And then… then that customer asks for a Founder of Thoughts about the process of taking an idea and making it reality for a lot of customers in an economically sustainable way.

I have tremendous respect for those that vulnerably share their mistakes and lessons learned. Although people, technologies, and markets change, we can learn from these stories.Here is a collection of fantastic postmortems I’ve saved over the past several months:Founder of Product Hunt. More at Startup failures and lessons learned

A month ago when planning how to get the maximum number of sales during this holiday quarter the marketing guys at To date, Lost My Name’s drivers of growth have used three classic internet startup techniques:This has gotten us to where we are today, selling over 5000 books a day to customers all over the world.But, given that we expect to sell more books in the run up to Christmas (Q4) than the other three quarters of the year put together, its vital that we explore every mechanism to tell as many people about the magic of Lost My Name as possible.So our attention naturally turned to the granddaddy of mass marketing — TV. Our product has mass appeal, so we thought TV might just work. In the past, we’d had success using TV to spread the word after Lost My Name appeared on Dragons Den. You can read about On the other hand, doing a TV ad is As far as we know we’re the In this post I’m going to explain the The first thing to point out, again, is that TV is expensive. Very expensive. Especially if you’re used to digital marketing. People in the industry talk about ‘The TV tax’, where you basically add a zero or two, or three on to everything you do.Here are the things you have to pay for before you start getting any feedback on whether the TV ad is working to increase sales.All in, doing a TV campaign means Fortunately, at Before you start working on the creative idea for your Ad and filming it you should We used a London agency called They started by asking us who our customers are. We aim most of our current marketing campaigns at women aged 25–50 on Facebook so that was where we started with TV.The agency then go away and come back with a schedule of shows that they think match our target audience and an expected budget.We’d allocated £60k a week to spend on the media buy. GoodStuff told us that this gave us enough money to buy around 34 TVRs. A This equated to around 400 plays of our ad on air.It’s worth pointing out that We couldn’t afford that, and we couldn’t satisfy the demand if it worked. But more importantly, All ads start with a script. For us this was quite easy to do. We decided to do a ‘Direct Response’ TV ad where we want customers to ‘take action’ from the ad and search for Lost My Name (as compared to just making people aware of the brand).We basically want people watching the Ad to We already had a 90 second film running on the homepage of our site that we know increases conversion rates by 1–2%, so we decided we’d just re-work the script of this existing film.Writing our script was made even easier because one of the co-founders of Lost My Name, Also, fortunately we also had most the footage we needed because we had the rushes from the original shoot of our 90 second ad. Here’s the ad that plays on our site.We asked an editor to make a rough cut of the 30 second version using the original footage, and then we tweaked the script and made a prototype of the new 30 second version of the ad.This phase is normally called ‘pre-production’. Typically you’d pay an agency or producer around If you want to broadcast a TV ad in the UK you have to submit your script to So before you shoot your ad you should submit your script to them to make sure it won’t get banned later on. It can take We took the decision to press on with production anyway, because we didn’t have time to wait for the OK — as mentioned, we have some experienced TV people at Lost My Name who made that call, but I would not advise it.ClearCast took a look at our script and sent back some more information requests — they asked us to justify the claim that our book was ‘ a magical book They also required us to put info about when you have to order by to get your book by Christmas.Normally at this stage you’d begin a second pre-production process to get the ad made, figuring out who will be your voice over artist, what locations you need to shoot at, what audio recording needs to be made, what props you need, who will be your actors etc etc.But, at this stage, we already had original footage we were going to use of the kids enjoying their Lost My Name books, so we just had to re-shoot the product shots.In addition, we had a special weapon — Steph — who runs a production company called Normally a production company would charge around We shot our new product shots at Steph’s house on 5K film and spent Once you’ve done your shoot you need to edit the raw footage. Typically a post production (post) company would charge around We spent You’ll also need a separate sound studio to record the voice over and music and background and mix it down into the ad. Most Post Production companies offer this service as well.The price of this can vary enormously depending on the type of licenses you buy and the amount of music you use. It could cost you anything from We spent After you’ve done your initial ‘offline’ edit you take your raw material (film, the sound, the animation, the voice over) and you make what’s called an ‘online’ edit that puts all the pieces together. Now you can actually see what your ad is really going to look like.The The final part of the editing process requires you to In addition, every TV station has its own subtly different requirements for sound and picture quality so you have to render your ad out in various formats (e.g Sky is playing out in 4k right now). Again, the parallels with web design are interesting — this reminds me of browser testing.Finally, you have to add these weird clock numbers and bits at the start and end of the ad to make sure the station can sync your ad for broadcast.All in, we basically spent around This is insanely cheap. It’s probably safe to say that the average ad costs ten times this to get to this stage, at So, you now have a good looking, legal, TV ad that can be broadcast.Oops. No you don’t! You then have to resubmit the ‘online’ edit to ClearCast for a final approval. Wahey.Normally an agency would take Once we did that, we gave all the money to Good Stuff and they went to the TV stations with a wheelbarrow full of money and bought the slots.You do need a media buying agency to do this. They basically have relationships with the various TV stations which means they can organise all the payments. They then send you a media schedule with a list of stations your ad is going on.The final piece of the puzzle is to actually We used Here’s our finished advert!We could do it much cheaper and quicker than normal because we had experienced people who knew what they were doing. I’m afraid there’s probably no substitute for this.We also managed the risk by reusing footage and buying a weeks worth of ads with the option to buy more.Next up we’ll be writing about P.S — If you found this interesting, hit subscribe below and Writing about the work behind the scenes done by the writers, designers, engineers and everyone else 

I’ve received exactly two emails from work since the beginning of my parental leave to the effect of “hey, hope everything’s great” and “keep sending photos of the new kid!” Neither of them expected an answer, as I shouldn’t be checking work email anyway.I’m fortunate to be a part of, as a coworker eloquently put it, a startup that grownups want to work for.Well, maybe we’re not a startup. The office is abandoned during the weekends. Yes, we have an Actual Office and we’re not squatting in someone’s dining room. We’re big enough to have catered Friday lunches, monthly Happy Hours and Game Nights, quarterly volunteer hours. We have Grownup Benefits with all the associated paperwork. We have standard issue, enigmatic ADP logins which only work during a lunar eclipse and a Supermoon.

Since I started writing on Medium, I’ve been very impressed with the amount (and quality) of thought put into Every day, I’m discovering new features that make writing and reading so much more pleasant on Medium.Yesterday, it was their easy drag-and-drop-into-post to upload pictures feature. Today, it’s their reading time feature which indicates how long it will take to read through each article. This really manages a reader’s expectations and sets the tone right for each read (How often do we browse an article only to realise it’s too long and end up just scrolling through and not reading it? With this, you can pace yourself better and therefore absorb knowledge more effectively.).Brilliant, just brilliant.

Earlier this year, I decided I was going to take the initiative to start my first startup. However, I’d never really done any web development before so I had no clue how much money I needed to get started. One of the biggest factors deterring me from starting a company was that I thought I didn’t have the funds necessary to start one. I read in several places that the barrier to entry was much lower now than before because of low costs, but I couldn’t really find information on what these costs were and how low they actually were.I did a lot of research online and came across different calculators — Eventually I gave up on trying to figure out how much it would cost and decided to just build it. I was amazed at how cheap it was to build my startup’s MVP. Now, as I get ready to launch my product, I thought I’d share what I learned to help other people who are trying to figure out whether it’s feasible to build and launch their own product.The total development costs for my startup from start to launch was Building and launching has become extremely cheap and easy, especially if you’re willing to put in the time and effort to learn some web development. Different products have different needs and costs, but hopefully this post helps some aspiring entrepreneurs realize just how cheap it really is to start a company.Follow me on Senior at UIUC CS • Most recently: VC for the summer at General Catalyst

My co-founder and I spent about 2 weeks putting together our first business plan. We prepared more than 100 slides, each densely packed with text, figures and charts. We got the deck bound. We even used shiny quality paper and hard covers. It was nice and heavy. We thought that it gave us credibility as first time entrepreneurs. After all, we barely had a product and no traction to speak of so we needed something else that looked “serious”.During our first investor meeting we pulled out the deck. You could hear the thud when the deck hit the table. We felt proud as if we were two nerdy kids who had completely overdone their homework.Half an hour later we barely got through 15 slides. The investor was bored out of her mind. She asked us to describe our startup in a single sentence. Our reply didn’t seem to convey what was so different about our idea. We tried giving a longer answer but the investor interrupted asking us to describe our growth strategy. Again, we couldnt give a coherent answer in a single sentence. The meeting was over soon. Out of politeness she took our deck — probably she thought it would be a good (and very heavy) doorstop.We walked out frustrated. It was clear we would never prepare a slide deck that big again. A rookie mistake. However, it seemed unfair that we needed to describe our idea in a single sentence. How can a single sentence do justice to an idea like ours?! We thought the investor was obsessed with a trivial issue and we simply needed to talk to other, more reasonable, investors.Eventually we managed to get funding. We hired a team and began building our product in earnest. However, we kept struggling to describe our startup in a single sentence. We did come up with many single sentence descriptions, however, none of them successfully delivered the punch. We would always resort to longer explanations. In fact, we couldnt summarise any part of our strategy in a single sentence. We thought people would believe in our product once they got the chance to use it. We hoped that somehow clarity would emerge from a sequence of A/B tests. But it didn’t.Our startup lasted for another year before failing due to a wide range of typical reasons. Fundamentally, our inability to come up with a single sentence description of our startup was a symptom of a much later problem — the lack of a coherent vision of what we wanted to build.If we asked everyone in the team to write a single-sentence description, we wouldnt have probably come up with the same answer. In all likelihood the same was true for our business model, growth hypothesis and most other aspect of our startup. Were we really pulling in the same direction? Could we prioritise the right activities as a team?The failure of the startup indicates we didn’t.As a founder you should be able to describe every important component of your startup in a single sentence. This is not to impress investors (although it will certainly help) but to make sure that your own thinking is crystal clear. You should also make sure that everyone in your team is able to do the same and that your view of the startup is coherent.Get everyone in the same room, give them a sheet of paper and ask them to describe each of the following items in a single sentence.Let everyone in the team read out the answers. You will be surprised by the differences. You need to discuss them and repeat Step 1.Get everyone to talk to outsiders (e.g. users, advisors or perhaps other people in the startup community) about their single sentence descriptions. Can the outsiders understand exactly why your startup is positioned for success? Again, you will be surprised by the answers.Repeat Steps 1-3 until you can all agree that everyone has the same understanding of your startup and why it will succeed. Keep your answers and revisit them in a month or two.Early stage startups evolve with every iteration. This doesnt mean that at any given point you and your team should not have clarity of your vision. It’s the only way for everyone to pull in the same direction.A strategy consultant, tech entrepreneur and admirer of great design.On London’s tech scene

Fresh out of university, not quite bright eyed and bushy tailed but definitely ready to move on and find an industry to succeed in, startups give graduates instant responsibility and a chance to carve out a meaningful role for themselves within a business. It’s not the free fruit or table tennis that should be the draw, it’s the opportunity to work in an innovative environment where everyone’s opinion counts and where having a chat with CEO is as easy as crossing the office — a stark contrast to the more corporate, office politics riddled roles many of your friends may end up in.Programming is the classic route in. While it may not be modern day poetry as some have suggested, writing code will always be crucial to most startups. If you think Javascript looks like stepping into ‘The Matrix’ don’t be alarmed — there are plenty of other opportunities. Wrote for a student paper? Think about becoming a copywriter. Addicted to Twitter and Facebook? Apply to the marketing department and see how social media can affect a company’s brand. Ultimately, candidates with prior experience and skills will always be preferred — you should always be on the lookout for ways that you can widen your skill set and make yourself more employable while you’re at university. Be proactive in trying to get relevant work experience, failing that, societies and campus brand ambassador schemes are good ways to develop the skills that startups will be looking for.Companies will also be gauging whether you have the qualities that will help you fit in with everyone else. Sometimes this is as simple as ‘do I want to sit next to this guy for 10 hours a day’, but often it’s the most important part of the evaluation process. Startups want to find hard working and creative individuals who are going to add to their existing team dynamic. This is particularly important given the freedom that many new hires are given from the outset. At Valve you’re given a desk with wheels and told to roll around and find a project that interests you! Google makes sure you spend 10% of your time working on your own projects and ideas to help the company. If you can convince the company in question that you tick these boxes and will be able to hit the ground running without constant supervision, (your new colleagues won’t have time for extended ‘nannying’), then you’ve got a great chance.They don’t have the money to flaunt their presence all over campus. They won’t be in the ‘Times Top 100’ and they won’t be sponsoring your university’s football team. Often it takes a little more time and a little more research to find one that you want to apply to, but that’s important! You shouldn’t just be applying to the companies that your best mate is applying to anyway. Taking the extra time forces you to think about the kind of environment that you want to work in — the right cultural fit for you. Find a role that suits your skills and a company that fits your character and goals and you’ll end up with a job that you will actually enjoy!Persistence throughout this process is key. Be sure to follow up your correspondence and make sure someone gets back to you — everyone at a startup is swamped and you may not be on top of their to-do-list. You can easily improve your chances of getting noticed by being a little inventive with your application. Reach out to the company on social media, show examples of your work or track down a relevant contact to speak to on Linkedin. 80% of jobs are never advertised so being proactive certainly pays off. We had an applicant that designed a website that detailed exactly why he wanted to work for us — that’s the kind of thing that gets you through the door.The application process may be a little different, but then so is the job. Working at a startup is dynamic, varied and interesting and I wholeheartedly believe that everyone should at least consider it.VP Growth at Beamery, the recruiting platform that leverages A.I.

The one thing that really bothered me is the crappy livechat solutions.Currently there are some players (olark, snapengage, zopim, …) that have nailed the (visitor) interface and the process around the chat. But no one has thought about the agent/team experience. Plus the mobile experience is horrible!Has anyone tried this ?

That way I’ll be the target audience and know what is important giving me a great head start.Don’t get me wrong: I will not start this business just because I think it’s a great idea. Before I continue I need to be sure that this is a problem worth solving. More on that below.The idea for LiveSlack to become successful is under-do the competition. There are plenty of LiveChat services out there. I lost count after the first 20. I guess olark, snapengage and Zopim are the most famous ones.So what will we do ?

When we talk about startups these days, we usually talk about small ventures that were started in a small garage by a couple of geeks that became or are becoming the next big thing.Financing from the biggest Business Angels and VCs on planet earth. First office in Silicon Valley and New York. IT department in India with 200+ employees. A sky rocking IPO in two to three years after launch.Never having to work again. Enjoying life to the fullest. That’s something we all dream about. A dream that seems so close. A dream that we are all trying to live. But this is nothing new. A couple of years back we called this dream the “American Dream”.Thanks to the world’s biggest investment vehicles and their business plans that need to be fuelled with “big hits” we can now all live the “American Dream”. The “American Dream” was globalized.The best thing about it: we don’t have to move to the US anymore. The “American Dream” was internationally scaled and can now be chased from Ho Chi Minh City, over Bangalore to Rio de Janeiro. To put it in an investor‘s words: the US were the proof-of-concept and global scaling is currently in process.The German saying “from a dishwasher to a multimillionaire” is outdated. Today we would say from an “entrepreneur to a business angel”.But don’t get me wrong here. I deeply believe in entrepreneurship, innovation and technology. I am convinced that this is the only chance to get the entire world out of poverty and create new and sustainable jobs and companies.But what I am trying to say is that you should think about what you really want in life. Do you want to chase a dream that will allow you to live a life that you maybe already have?Be honest to yourself and ask yourself if founding a venture will help you to achieve your dreams and allow you to live the life you really want to live. If you dream about a relaxed, stress- and care free life and having a lot of money, founding a company might be the wrong choice.Don’t start a company based on wrong assumptions and wrong expectations. Starting a business will be very stressful, you will usually be on a tight budget and it takes many years, or even decades until you hit the jackpot. Most of the times you will never get a glimpse at this jackpot, ever.But if your goal is to change and improve people’s lives and create create value, then starting a company in our digitized world is a great and very powerful tool. If you think back in time, changing people’s lives took a lot more a couple of decades ago.Nelson Mandela, had to stay in prison for 27 years to fight apartheid. Mahatma Gandhi was eight years in prison to fight for India’s independence.So before taking the decision to start a venture sit back, relax and think about what you really want in life. The classic tale of the “executive and the Mexican fisherman” is a wonderful story that represents how we all have learned to focus on what we desire mentally without taking into account what we really want in life.You can use this story as inspiration to slow down, reassess, and get real about how you want to live life. Otherwise at some point in life you might find out that you are not the type to found a company and wasted your time and money chasing someone else’s dream.Feel free to also connect with me on Facebook Photo: Entrepreneur | Author | Blogger | Works at 

‘The minute a major Silicon Valley VC sets up a branch in Mexico, you will be out of business,’ a Mexican founder told me over dinner at last year’s Mexico VC Day in San Francisco. I did not respond because I actually think our risk of going out of business is higher if they don’t come. And we don’t expect them to come in the near future.Last June, SVB (Silicon Valley Bank), LAVCA (Latin American Venture Capital Association) and Endeavor organized a trip to Mexico City for ‘leading Silicon Valley VC funds and investors’ in order to scope out the investment potential in Mexico. The entrepreneurial community expected to welcome partners from top-notch funds such as Sequoia, Adreessen Horrowitz and Accel, who were coming to get their piece of Mexico’s dynamic and fast-growth investment pie. Unfortunately, not one of these VC market leaders sent a partner, EIR or associate, reflecting their indifference for Mexico´s vibrant VC investment climate. A similar trip to China was organized by SVB 7 years ago with great reviews to the point that some claim it sparked off a wave of successful investment.So why the lack of interest? Is Mexico too risky? Unimpressive Growth? Lack of innovation? Seems too small today? Silicon Valley funds invest in much more unstable and risky environments such as China and Israel. They participate in zero-growth regions like Europe and Japan. China and India’s hottest venture backed startups are mostly copycats. And finally, when has today’s market size been a problem for an industry living in tomorrow!I am sure many have great answers to justify all of the above. While, I can’t explain the indifference to the Mexican investment market, I certainly can describe what they are missing out.‘We invest in Silicon Valley because, we happen to find a disproportionate amount of talent here. We’ll go where the talent is’, so they say.Mexican founders are excellent. Just as in Israel and India, Mexican entrepreneurs develop a grit early-on as they defy the immeasurable odds of functioning in a business environment riddled with corruption, insecurity and monopolistic uncertainty. Time and time again Mexico has been ranked within the top-ten hardest working countries in the world, testimony to the relentless work ethic that governs the nation. Mexican entrepreneurs never shy away from long hours, long days, long years. Most of the entrepreneurs have lived in the highly international and integrated NAFTA economy. Founders in Mexico have studied in Stanford, MIT or Harvard and worked for Paypal, Groupon or Uber before launching their first company. This founders are supported by high profile Endeavor mentors, experienced Angel Venture Mexico angel investors and a new group of extremely talented Venture Capital investors.When BlablaCar, the French Unicorn, decided to launch in Latin America, Brazil seemed like the most obvious option and started working on its development. However, they made a 5,000 mile course adjustment and instead acquired Mexican startup Aventones to partner with the talented Cristina Palacios, Alberto Padilla and Ignacio Cordero. More recently Mexican entrepreneurs Oscar Salazar, first Uber CTO, and Adolfo Babatz, ex Paypal executive and MIT grad, respectively raised $14 M for healthtech startup Pager and $5 M for fintech juggernaut Payclip to scale two of the most promising new companies in the region. Mexican founders are finding ways to succeed but a huge talent pool is still untapped.“Mexico has so much potential to become a powerful country (in the startup world). It can change to an innovation-based economy. It could be huge.” Marcus Dantus, founder of Startup MexicoMexico’s entrepreneurial ecosystem has finally begun to gain density and dynamism, leading Latin America’s early stage investing activity — complete with co-working spaces, accelerators and angel investors. The Mexican government may have trouble keeping a felon in prison but they nailed it when creating INADEM (Instituto Nacional del Emprendedor) one of the most advanced and comprehensive public policy frameworks, attracting the likes of 500 and Techstars. Three years after a massive injection of subsidies to the ecosystem, Mexico has become the hottest market for the most promising startups from the Spanish speaking countries around the world.‘The product is great, your traction is impressive and we’d love to partner with you but it is still too small for us’. blank Silicon Valley investor to blank promising Mexican startup.As an investor helping founders raise follow on rounds in Silicon Valley, we hear the above comment all the time regarding E-commerce and Fintech. And looking at today’s figures, these industries are indeed small. The huge internal market potential is undeniable unless, somehow, the millions and millions of Mexican smartphones will never buy or bank. If the timing doesn’t seem right for these market, timing is phenomenal for larger industries that are going through systemic change. These untapped opportunities represent 100 billion dollar markets within the Healthcare, Telecom and Energy Sectors, further enhanced by technology shifts and long-awaited regulatory reforms. The next ‘Unicornio’ may not be an app but it might as well be a SAS startup for hospitals or an electricity trading platform.If you are a value-added investor, you know that in order to evaluate any investment opportunity, you need to include your own impact on the start up’s path to success. When evaluating Mexico as an opportunity, I would argue that Silicon Valley funds need to compute the impact of their investing in Mexico. When Dave McClure partnered with Cesar Salazar and Santiago Zavala to launch 500 Mexico City, they probably made that calculation. They could leverage the raw talent and seize these amazing opportunities. Unfortunately, as good as they are, they need to team up with their Silicon Valley follow on co investors to make their model work. Our ecosystem would benefit greatly from having Silicon Valley funds investing in Mexico; working along these funds would make us better Venture Capital investors for our founders. In the end, founders would be able to have the best of two worlds: the Silicon Valley know-how and capital and the local support and experience.So today, unless leading Silicon Valley investors start thinking about the Mexico of tomorrow and invest here, we are all missing out.Venture Capital investor, Marketer, Stanford lecturer, co founder of 

My post In this post I will discuss Michael Porter’s 3 Generic Competitive Strategies. My goal in these posts is to provide concrete yet easy to use frameworks that founders of early stage startups can quickly learn and adapt as they work on moving their organizations through the discovery process that takes them from being a startup to becoming a company.To ensure we are on the same page, and thinking about the issues from the same starting point . . . first, some definitions. You can skip past the definitions if you have already seen them in one of my previous posts.In Competitive Strategy, Michael Porter describes Before delving into the details of the generic strategies, one observation; Often, discussions about strategy get stuck in dogma — is it about creating a competitive position that a startup can defend, or is it about gaining market share? I do not think strategy can be an either/or proposition in that sense. It must be both. Good strategy protects a startup’s current market position, while attempting to reshape the competitive landscape such that it tilts overwhelmingly to that startup’s advantage.Also, by definition a startup is still searching for a strategy . . . so many of the examples I will use are of companies, not startups. However, the idea is that this helps a founder go through the search and discovery phase of building a startup with these frameworks in mind.The following generic strategies help a startup create a defensible position in its market, but they should also be thought of as a means for launching offensive moves to gain market share as market conditions evolve.A startup might choose a cost leadership strategy in order to cope with the threats posed by powerful buyers who can push prices down, but no further down than the cost leader in that market can bear. Also, cost leadership provides wiggle room for dealing with the threats posed by powerful suppliers who can increase the costs of inputs that the startup needs in order to develop its own products. Becoming the cost leader in a given market lowers the threat posed by new entrants to the market under the established rules of competition because the decision to enter the market under those conditions would be difficult to execute at a cost that is acceptable.Startups exploring cost leadership as a strategy should consider making large upfront capital expenditure investments with an eye towards achieving economies of scale within a relatively short window of time. As they gain market share and scale, startups pursuing a cost leadership strategy will need to continue making relatively large CapEx investments that are aimed at keeping their overall costs low.Additionally, cost leadership entails paying more attention to continuous process innovation, higher than normal labor-monitoring practices and pay-structures that might be described by outside observers as “below market”, and intense scrutiny of and discipline towards keeping overhead costs within a narrow band relative to revenues.Examples:The image below, showing the startups that have been built by unbundling CraigsList shows another risk of the cost leadership strategy; namely that someone else can compete with some aspect of another startup’s business model by pursuing differentiation or focus as a strategic choice.A startup might choose a differentiation strategy because it helps insulate it against competition. When implemented successfully, differentiation creates a barrier to entry that is very hard for new entrants to overcome. Successful execution of a differentiation strategy has a strong positive correlation with brand value, leading to customers of the startups products becoming less sensitive to price since by definition a highly differentiated product has no close substitutes.The cumulative effects over time of a successful differentiation strategy become apparent in a number of ways. The threat posed by buyers reduces over time since they do not have a very good alternative to the differentiated product. Pursuing a differentiation strategy often means that the startup can maintain and enjoy profit margins that are considerably higher than average for that market. Consequently, startups that pursue a differentiation strategy maintain room for maneuvers that would have been unavailable had they pursued a cost leadership strategy instead.The organizational traits that make pursuing a differentiation strategy possible are; strong marketing and brand-building skills, continuous product innovation, relatively large RD expense, and an organizational culture that emphasizes customer support.Examples: Apple.Examples: Every early stage technology startup that grows successfully after the search for a repeatable, scalable, profitable business model is complete.I get it. I understand the dilemma. Capital is scarce, your burn won’t go away if you wish to keep working on your startup. All these potential customers come along with promises of potential revenues to ease the stress posed by your lack of capital . . . The temptation to “take as much revenue as you can get, from whomever is offering it” is nearly impossible to resist. I get it. I would have the same struggle too if I were in your shoes.Yet, we have to pause and think about this for a few minutes lest we do something rash.Paul Graham is often quoted as having said that early stage startups should “What is often not well understood by some investors, and many founders . . . especially first time founders is why that advice is so important.Here’s Paul in his own words:That initial fragility is why focus is theIf you have not done so yet, you should read Paul’s post. He delves into the subject in a way only he can.Imagine a team of 3 co-founders with 2 contract developers helping build a product, it could be an enterprise or consumer product . . . and let’s assume they raised a $750K in outside capital. Now think of the stress that team would be taking upon itself if it were to try to serve 10 different enterprise customers in 8 different industries. Consider all the ways each of these industries might differ in terms of the business protocols that the startup would have to become subject to, now also consider the ways in which each of the 10 customers might differ from the others. With only a few exceptions, it would make more sense to win 10 customers in 1 or 2 industries . . . Gain experience, gather momentum in those markets, grow the team in step with the growth of the startup’s customer-base and revenues . . . . and only when business development in those initial markets has reached a tipping point, then the startup can begin exploring customer acquisition in other markets. An analogous thought process works for startups building apps for consumers, and reaches a similar conclusion.Think of it as building a solid foundation before attempting to complete the structure which will rest on the foundation. What ever the size of the structure, it will not last if the foundation that is meant to hold it up is weak.Most research about why early startups fails lists the top two reasons as some combination of “produced something for which there was no market” and “run out of cash” . . . The research is often not granular enough to enable us to say definitely what exact reason led to those conclusions, but . . . A failure by an early stage startup’s founders to adopt focus as the launch strategy makes those two outcomes inevitable. Why?First, lack of focus means the startup spreads itself too thin and fails to find and devote its attention and resources to those customers or users with the highest propensity to use, and then pay for the product.Second, a lack of focus can be exorbitantly expensive if the startup is selling a product that is far from fully-baked to multiple industries. Several rounds of customizations for a small number of customers in a given market without a sales process to increase the revenues from that market quickly results in expenses that can quickly get out of control. It is not difficult to think of how this plays out for startups building apps for consumers.Early stage VC 

Elepago was a mobile payment company looking to introduce pay-by-phone functionality to Mexico. The following is a timeline of the events spanning the life of Elepago.I had recently graduated from Princeton University and decided to move back to Monterrey, Mexico to start a business. Rooted by my love for technology and the start-up culture, I was dedicated to bring the Silicon Valley mentality to Monterrey.After intense market research and getting a feel for the country, I decided digital payments was the way to go. The original idea was something that would facilitate online payments. Competitors included PayPal, MercadoPago, DineroMail, and more. After mulling around the idea, I decided to leverage mobile phones for loyalty management, convenience, and security. With a ‘solid’ 60-page business plan, my father and I committed $300,000 MXN ($22,000 USD) to give life to Elepago.Young and ambitious, I decided to take on the payment world. The mobile-security enhanced online payment quickly shifted to a digital wallet for use in physical stores. I had a couple of meetings with people around town and found a to-be co-worker, Charlton Harrison. Since we were just getting started and strapped for cash, he accepted a below-market salary and would get 18% equity of the company (when incorporated).He has 20+ years experience in programming, while I was learning the basics of Javascript and the difference between client  server-side languages. We began working full-time on getting a prototype put together.Elepago, SAPI de CV is incorporated in Monterrey, Mexico. Prototype is ready; we are working on a full product now. Charlton’s expertise helps for back-end work and database architecture. I invested my time to learn about AWS for elastic cloud hosting as well as modern javascript technologies to set the framework for a mobile app. We decided to use PhoneGap with jQuery Mobile (which we later replaced with Ionic Framework). This helped us to only maintain one code base for both iOS  Android.After prepping and pitching to family and friends for over 3 months, we finally close an angel round for Elepago.Four investors committed a total of $4,000,000 MXN (~$300,000 USD) to be made available over the next 12 months as goals are met in exchange for 40% of the company (given out in a weighted proportion to the money).By this point my father and I had invested $550,000 MXN. One caveat they included was that we also complete the $1,000,000 MXN contribution that they were making at the end of the 12 months. We agreed.We closed with this straight equity deal.By the closing, we had set up connections with Mexican payment processors (Stripe/Braintree solutions didn’t exist at the time in Mexico) and our app was finally able to charge credit cards.NOTE: We were pre-revenue. We had a couple large potential clients; but no deals. We had nothing. We convinced them mostly by showing case-studies of similar companies. The high-growth and high-valuations caught their eye and opened them to the potential. They later commented the main reason they invested was because they believed in me.We begin try selling our product to retail stores. “Pay with your phone in the store”-type thing. We had meetings with some of the largest retailers in Mexico. The idea was to tie in loyalty programs to help them get rid of duplicate account nightmares and card production costs.Retail stores didn’t sell. We drifted into restaurants. We quickly signed 3 customers (two chains with between 5–15 restaurants each!).We had yet to integrate the restaurant’s point-of-sale. We reached out to the POS provider and signed a service agreement, in which they would develop the Elepago integration into their POS. The initial estimation was 1 month.Ramping up for sales, marketing, accounting, and customer support, I invite Ruben Marcos as Elepago’s 3rd co-founder and COO. We agree to pay him an average market salary, with 2–4% equity stake in the company.As for the technical side, we continue waiting for the POS integration. Without it, we have no product to launch.After waiting (and hassling) for almost 3 months, we get a call from the POS provider. “The integration is almost ready; however, we noticed you guys are getting into loyalty programs. We do loyalty programs. This leads to a conflict of interest and we cannot finalize or release the code.” Loyalty was always part of the mobile play as one of the key leveraging points for the phone.We were stuck. We had investors waiting for a product launch and we had nothing.Fueled by vengeance, I asked one of our customers for access to the main computer. I copied over his database to a USB. Charlton and I go heads down, learning Visual Basics in less than a week. We piece together a client-side desktop app that reads and monitors the 1997 .mdb database files, and relays pertinent information to our servers.We finally launch with a live beta at our first restaurant! Full of trail and error, our MVP was put the test and refined. For our monthly board meeting, we invited all the investors to lunch at the restaurant. Everything worked like a charm. We were able to see the bill in real-time and pay separately from our phone.Elepago officially launches and 4 restaurants go live within a week. Great initial reception by the restaurants, waiters, and users. We had strong marketing presence at the locations and grew quickly, processing about $25,000 MXN ($2,000 USD) in the first month. Daily visits to the locations were required to check up on the employees and marketing displays as well as to harvest any feedback.We hired person full time to do customer support. We also had some interns doing marketing work part-time.We close a more clients, including one with over 20 locations nationwide. Still pushing the product, we offered discounted pricing. Although we had to train employees and spent generously on marketing supplies, we waived the initial set up fee for the restaurants. We also gave attractive credit card processing rates between 1.5–2.5%. Our processing rate cost was initially 4.5%; we quickly got it down to 1.8%.These were good months! Great progress for Elepago’s first months with constant growth in monthly transaction volume as well as user registrations.Signing up and launching 6 restaurants per month, we were growing at steady rate. Although we had projected growth of up to 12 restaurants per month by now, we were happy with the 6. In our projections we didn’t consider the variety of different POS brands, modules, and versions. We developed an intelligent client-side integrator that allowed us to relatively easily service new POS’s — although the process was always full of trial and error.. We hired a developer who’s sole job was to complete integrations.Emails came in frequently complimenting us on such a great service; the only complaints we heard were: 1) add American Express and 2) get more locations.We began to work on merchant-oriented features such as loyalty campaigns “Thanks for your purchase. Come back in 7 days for a free drink”, feedback (NPS) systems “Would you recommend XX to your family and friends?”, and more. Our hopes were that by serving the merchant, they would begin to pay a monthly fee.April was a big month. We opened 2 restaurants outside of Monterrey in a small city called Saltillo. We took this to be the most concrete proof of concept — finally launching outside of our own city. Elepago worked. We will be millionaires. People had heard about us, they were asking for it in other cities. Aside from these new locations, we hit records across metrics: active users, new locations, transaction volume. We had grown the team to 12 people, including interns.Things are looking awesome. The COO talks to his dad, and they want to buy in for more shares. After bouncing it off the board, we reach a conclusion. The company will be diluted such that there are 5 equal shares (they will get the same % as the 4 previous investors, but it will be less than 10%). They buy in 9.2% for $1,100,000 MXN. With this buy-in all 5 investors will have the same equity, however a 10% premium on the original investors.Agreeing on this means we have diluted roughly as such:I consider the COO’s shares to be part of the operating team; so it was helpful in reducing our investor ratio from 40% to ~37%.With this, the total amount of capital committed to the project totaled $6,100,000 MXN.Note: we haven’t made any money yet.Summer turned out to be tough. This was expected to a degree: people went out of town, there was less regularity, etc.We continued to add new locations. Notwithstanding the location growth, our metrics stayed pretty flat. We were unable to pass our record set in April. With many new locations, we were spreading ourselves too thin.Fortunately, we met and began talks with a venture capital group in Mexico City. They liked our product. They also had contacts in the two largest restaurant operators in Mexico with 1,000s of locations. This was a nice gust of fresh air.We start to realize that transaction and volume growth is not coming at the pace we expected. Revenue is even further behind. We had signed on many clients, but with spectacular discounts. At times, even taking a loss on operations! just to serve them. We had seen a glimpse of the grim road that lay ahead.The operating team, namely myself and my 2 co-founders, break the news to the board. We had accomplished so much — processing cards in Mexico, created the application, gotten over 5,000 registered users, and processed over $800,000 MXN. However, it had been almost a 8 months of operation and we had not been able to churn any profit, if even net revenue from operations. Going forward we would have to pay hefty auditing fees to get PCI compliance and begin submitting compliance documentation as a money transmitter. We had also faced a couple of fraudulent cases losing ~$15,000 MXN that we had to cover. The processes and obstacles that were coming up seemed to high a barrier to tackle.The board decided to focus on ‘dressing up the bride’ and reach out to interested parties. Someone may be interested in launching an e-wallet and could make use of our platform. I always communicated this clearly to my team.The venture capital group continued to say they were interested, but we couldn’t get them to take action. We even threw them curveballs, offering to sell the system to them. They seemed to feed you what you want to hear, their words carrying little weight.We hadn’t made any progress on revenue, much less profits.We couldn’t find anyone interested in buying Elepago.It was in August that I called a board meeting and addressed the board bluntly. We still had about $3.0M MXN of committed capital available. However, I was no longer comfortable contributing money of my own. After going through the grind, I no longer had a path to generate revenue or profits. I was in no place to accept money from investors.They agreed. If we were going to shut down, we had to close quick.Throughout the course of Elepago’s life, we frequently stopped to consider our strategy. We realized we were operating at a loss, as many start ups do. In the beginning it was understandable because we had hope to generate revenue in the future. We had to invest in people to build the software that would make us millions. Even after getting the product out, it’s easy to justify that it takes time for people to get on your platform. Its then, It turns out that many startups do go that route, and it works. There are some key indicators you should look for if you are in a similar stage.-We had some people using it, but no body ready to pay for it. Restaurant owners didn’t want to pay for the service.We barely had any Our project didn’t turn out to be as scalable as we thought. I had the mentality that Elepago, a tech startup, was supposed to be a ‘create-the-system-and-watch-it-grow’ type thing. Maybe throw in some marketing stuff. Turns out we had to educate, train, and convince waiters and cashiers on how to use Elepago. We had to actively promote Elepago in each restaurant or else see 0 movement. We had to have technical visits to each location to get them up and running. Etc, etc. There was way more maintenance and physical work than we imagined. This equated to higher costs which weren’t compatible with our slim margins.I started Elepago right after graduating from college with a degree in Mechanical  Aerospace Engineering. Would I recommend other students to do a start up right after school? Yes and no.It was a tough journey. I challenged my discipline, my self-esteem, my persistence, my dedication; pretty much my whole character was put to the test. My girlfriend (now fiancé) would routinely say I was bipolar.It was out of my desire to succeed that I learned so much:One of the more concrete things I learned was to code. I came to truly enjoy the logical puzzles presented by applications. I enjoy researching and weighing out pros/cons of server configurations, server-side languages, MVC frameworks, and much more. It is because of Elepago that I became an adept programmer. I landed a job in the tech-hub of the world with the world’s leading real-estate platform, Zillow. I now do front-end development at HotPads. So I can’t say things didn’t work out.You will go through a lot of suffering: psychological imbalances, mood swings, and erratic behaviors. You will be lonely. You will feel the world on your shoulders. You won’t be able to take your mind off your project without feeling like a traitor to your team and investors.My advice applies particularly to high-tech, high-risk start up ventures. If you have a traditional, or even tech business, that is profitable early on, then you should definitely keep going with it. Many good things can and will come. You will feel pressure (a bit less especially if you have no investors!), but will at least have the success to counter any stress.But then again, if you are like me, stubborn to pursue your dream right out of college, who’s going to tell you you can’t do it? You wouldn’t listen to them anyways! You will never regret it.Even though my Elepago experience didn’t work out, I’d take it over a MBA any day.

Last week, I had the opportunity to attend There was plenty of practical advice that came out of the event. The TalentHackers NYC team have put together a more detailed summary Here were my 3 major takeaways:Too many people confuse company culture with office perks. There are countless definitions of what culture is… I see culture as a set of values that should guide decision-making in the absence of precise directives. It’s a way of working. Free beer and ping pong tables are not what makes a company culture great and this is not how you should sell what your company has to offer to prospective candidates.As a startup founder, you’ll need to get smart about recruiting efforts simply because it takes tremendous amounts of time.The growing discipline of data-driven recruiting is referred as Talent Hacking — namely treating your recruiting efforts much like you would treat your sales efforts with actionable metrics. Read the Talent Hacker’s Manifesto One way to optimize efforts is to track the channels by which you recruit and generate your own metrics on what works and what doesnt work for your company — depending on the type of roles you are looking to fill.For example, doing some A/B testing on the wording of your emails to potential candidates will let you see quickly what makes a difference. Also, the panelists recommended to find 3 ways to email the person you are targeting. Chances are that this person will think you really want him in and that might raise his interest and willingness to respond. Do not stop after 1 email, but you don’t want to spam people either, so 3 attempts is reasonable.There are some tools out there that can help you become more efficient at recruiting:Some other productivity apps that can help improve recruiting processes include:Finally, the most effective channels for technical talents includeTools are great and there are plenty I’m not mentioning here but great tools are useless if the recruiter using them is not qualified enough which is a frequent problem in fast growing startups …which leads to my last takeawayOnce a potential candidate is identified, it’s important to be smart about choosing who’s the best positioned to reach out:Recruiters have to really think about utilizing the team effectively rather than reaching out directly to targets.VCs wanting to help can be good or bad. Venture Capitalists have massive network they build actively every single day but their ability to help a portfolio company’s recruiting efforts obviously depends on their understanding of what’s required in the job. It might sound easy but this can be challenging depending on the type of positions and the personal startup experience of the partners you are working with. When they don’t truly understand what you really need, having to look at their low quality candidate recommendations is a distraction… At Finally, a more powerful recruiting weapon is referral programs. Unlike VCs or headhunters that suffer from perception biases that take time to mitigate, your own team is the most qualified first-degree network to find other high quality candidates. Leverage it by building a strong referral program. Even with cash incentives, referral programs are likely to be your highest ROI recruiting channel.Tech startups and a little bit of everything… VC A collection of thoughts, perspectives and insights from the iNovia Capital Team: Chris Arsenault, Shawn Abbott, Geoff Judge, Kevin Swan, Karamdeep Nijjar, Davidi Nault, Antoine Nivard and Kylie Toh.

You know that your marketing event was successful ifI went to a startup’s launch party this year that was nothing short of a great time. Hosted at a trendy club, it consisted of upbeat music, free food, a photobooth with fun props, and most importantly, an open bar. There was a main fully stocked bar, as well as a smaller bar in a quieter room with more of a loungy feel, that featured a locally famous mixologist that would create custom artisan cocktails to order. The event was held to celebrate the launch of a company, and if the goal was for the employees to have a blast with their friends on the company’s dime, then it was an obvious success.I would not be able to tell you the name of the company that threw the event. And I’m confident that I’m not alone on this. There were no banners, wall projections, or branded swag in the vicinity. There were no well-timed brand shoutouts from the DJ. There were no logos to be seen, whether on napkins, freebies, or anywhere that I noticed in my several hours of being present at the event. As a marketer, I found myself thinking, this is awesome and all, Overlooking the details comes at a large cost. The company could’ve easily produced wristbands with the company colors and their logo featured prominently on the band, and fastened them to every guest walking through the door. They could be told it was for the open bar. We would’ve happily responded, “thank you!” as it was attached to our wrists, because it would’ve felt like we were just given the gift of free drinks, and created a more exclusive vibe. With this slight detail implementation, more people would’ve left the party with at least brand awareness, as well as a (hopefully) more positive opinion of the company.Secondly, it is, after all, not just another Friday night at the club. It’s a technology startup’s celebration of their launch. May as well act like it! Instead of hosting the photo booth against a plain background, have the backdrop be reminiscent of the Grammy’s, the Kentucky Derby, the Cannes Film Festival…events that have photo opportunities seize the chance to publicize sponsors, a company, or the event itself. In the age of social media, these photos will spread beyond the attendees and further your event goals.Beyond splashing your company name everywhere to raise brand awareness, the more challenging objective is to Screeching the music to a halt moments before the beat was supposed to drop- to break out the projector to deliver a presentation on your company is obviously overkill. There is a time and a place for that, and it is not a weekend party taking place at a bar. Longer presentations and more in-depth explanations are appropriate for attentive audiences at professional events such as conferences, trade shows, and other industry events.However, showing a short video (ideally, less than 2 minutes) at the beginning of the night, to welcome everybody and to introduce the very reason everybody is here, is not only tolerable, but it is expected. As an attendee, I would actually appreciate getting the low down about what we’re supposed to be celebrating here. A clear, informative, and effective video should drive the right message home. It should be as simple as connecting the name with the function. Most people won’t remember the finer details and that’s okay. Marketing events are best used for positive brand awareness. If your attendees enjoyed themselves, and now know of your brand and its function, then your marketing event was a success.Life enthusiast / VP of Marketing JotForm related.  Ideas. Stories.

If you believe you already know the answer you are not open to learn larger truths.We all experienced computers often work better after you reboot them. It’s because of all these daemon processes that run in the background.Doubt, anger, peers or media can be like such daemon processes for a human being. Every time you try something new, they condemn  limit you.Paul brought up the example of this one executive who thought Gmail will never get beyond a million users.Things often don’t work out as we plan for them. Don’t let yourself strike back by them and use them to your advantage. Often great things are rooted in some of the worst events. Accept them and say: External success is not what you should be looking for. Refine success as While many people recommend to “do what you love” he advises to focus on “Love what you do”. Often the “do what you love”-reality is nothing like what you thought it would be. In the end it’s about all the small decisions you make during your day to day. Only if you care about them and enjoy doing them you will do the best possible job.The issue with being very goal oriented is that the time between now and completing a goal is becoming annoying  not worth spending it.For example Paul used to hate running. He always focused on the moment finishing the exercise. As he recognised it’s about every step you take, he started to enjoy it.One of Paul’s motivations is to rather fail in something awesome, than succeed in something boring. For example inside Google people work on absurdly ambitious ideas. At the time Gmail was built, building a JavaScript application always failed before. Still Paul built Gmail with JavaScript and it turned out well. After Gmail the impossible rapidly became the normal and many more JavaScript applications popped up. He mentioned:According to Paul everyone should the have the opportunity  freedom to work on whatever they want to. It would make us all wealthier and to make it happen we need to end the wage slavery.Can you imagine how many undiscovered Steve Jobses are there?Patrick walked us through the early days of Stripe. From the day he and his brother John started to work on /dev/payments to the their public launch as Stripe.They wanted to have a couple production users very early on to shape the product and make sure they actually are onto something. Nevertheless they stayed in private beta for a long time. He advised to While their growth curve looks incredible most recently it was quite flat for a long time.And that’s what they focused on: Patrick often gets asked if it is necessary to be in the Valley to be successful. From his perspective you can build a great a company from anywhere, but being in the Valley maximises your chances.

For Hiroki it was during first week at the university where he met the guys at whom’s company he started his first internship later and which shaped his path to entrepreneurship.Everyone of us can come up with this theoretical really interesting ideas. So did Hiroki and his co-founder Matt when they worked on their previous company GrouPAY. But they didn’t solve a real problem.In the past Hiroki thought success would be linear, but in reality there are peaks  troughs. You constantly need to make course corrections. In the early days Hiroki  his team discussed hours for the smallest product changes, that didn’t matter in the end. They wanted to get everything right, because they thought they didn’t have the resources to make mistakes.It’s important to be emotionally unaffected by any bad event happening. For example Hiroki  Matt were near bankrupt several times and living in awful conditions. In order to buy things they had to split bills between multiple credit  debit cards. To Hiroki holding on was one of the hardest things he ever did. If you hold on, you can succeed. Still if it wasn’t for his co-founder he would never have made it.After selling a couple of companies Alfred started the fund VentureFrogs in 1999. They focussed on Zappos and TellMeNetworks because they weren’t doing so well.While there were a lot of e-commerce companies Zappos had a special ingredient. Their Alfred also learned that a lot of companies start out with a great culture, but lose it over time as they simply forget to invest in it, because they were busy with their day to day. You need to focus on culture on a daily basis.As he has been asked what kind of investors an entrepreneur should look out for he responded that as a company you should look for a partner, not for an investor. He recommended to spend more time to get to know your investors before you let them invest, because if it works out it’s going to be a 5-15 year journey.Urška and her co-founder Sandro noticed people were talking about remote pregnancy monitoring systems for quite some time, but nobody made it work.

Most days it doesn’t feel like you’re building the big audacious thing.How can it feel like a grand vision when you’re hiring sales people, doing press releases, and dealing with your developers debating all sides of the work-from-home policy?A founder’s life tends to suck most days. The best you can do is go through the brutally slow progress with good cheer and a sense of purpose.Many founders get so caught up in the day-to-day of their business they forget why we’re here: to try big things!The worst thing that can happen to many startups is they quickly get to a $50,000 in monthly revenue and then find out that the business doesn’t scale — or perhaps it scales slowly. Now they have to figure out what to do with this $600,000 per year business that they spent a year building, and that simply isn’t going to get everyone the outcome they want.It sucks to unplug something working, and no one knows for sure if that “dead end” business is just one or two tweaks away from exploding. There are countless examples of unexpected wins that magically show up at a company — App installs for Facebook comes to mind. Remember a couple of years back when Facebook’s ads were flat and everyone was dumping the stock? Yeah, no one does — because they figured out mobile ads!I like to step back from my business every couple of months and ask this question:Write all your ideas down and debate the ideas with individuals you trust. Give them the disclaimer, “Was thinking about my business, and while we’ve achieved X, Y and Z, I think if I were given the chance to start over I would just focus 100% on X because of A, B, and C. What do you think of that logic?”In most cases you’re going to have figured out something profound, and you’ll be glad you did. It might not give you a clear path but it might tell you where to generally look for a solution.I find myself doing this with founders more and more often: “Oh, we’re having a hard time making X work? I see a lot of folks having success with Twitter ads for Y and YouTube pre-roll ads for Z. You might want to talk to A, B, and C about their experience.” It’s not an exact place to find the fish, but more like the fish are biting in that general area over yonder.A second way to get some fresh eyes and vision on your startup is to go to founders you respect and ask the following question:After asking this question you’re going to get a ton of different ideas. Some will suck and one might be brilliant. Your job is to ask enough super qualified people to get an idea of what might result in the biggest outcome for you and your team.If you ask five people and get five different ideas, that tells you something valuable as well: there might be a lot of different ways to go about scaling this business. Or, maybe no one can figure it out. This stuff is hard, that’s why you’re reading this blog (and why I’m writing it): to try and get answers.The important thing is that when you meet with VCs you have some big, audacious ideas you want to try.It is completely fine to go to a VC and say: “We are at $1m in revenue and have customers who love us. We see three ways for us to grow revenue much faster: X, Y, and Z. We are raising money to test those ideas and then figure out which to pursue hard.”If you present your business as small, you can’t expect the people who want to go big to join you on your adventure. If you want to get the big money you have to be willing to think big.[ Note: none of this means you should be reckless and act like a drunken sailor who just got to port and can’t wait to spend all their money as fast as possible. The point here is that you must never stop thinking big. ]best @jasonPS — Speaking of thinking big, this week on TWIST I hosted two amazing minds for the news roundtable: I angel invest in awesome startups... and try to build them myself. Be excellent to each other.

Our startup, At first, we were reluctant. Now we think it was one of the best decisions we made for our company. This post tells you why, if you are starting your venture, you should consider moving to Cincy to chase your dreams.If you are in startup mode, you probably don’t have any money to spend. And it’s fine. Let me get started by telling you the good news: A bus ticket is $1.75, but if you have a bike, you won’t need the bus, or even a car. And if you don’t, rent one from the newly announced I always believed San Francisco is the perfect size to conduct experiments. They have a manageable, tech-saavy community ready to meet your new baby. Just release it to the wild, and they will try it. For example, it’s hard to imagine other city than San Francisco to initially test Uber. If it works there, it for sure might work in other bigger cities as well.Cincinnati is similar. The access to capital here is unmatched. Yes, you can try in San Francisco, but there you will be amongst several other startups as well, all of them competing for the attention of the VC, and so you will most likely need to double your efforts in order to be heard.Just remember: funds from the midwest are not only about funding great ideas, but about helping regional entrepreneurs succeed. The first day we arrived here we were introduced to Chris from There are all kind of events, like Building a startup is one of the hardest things you will do in your life, but these folks make things easier. I’ve been lucky enough to have lived in London, New York, San Francisco and Geneva, each time working for early stage tech startups, and in my experience, Cincinnati gives you the best value to get your company started.Seriously, if you are thinking about it, move here. Apply for The Brandery — or just stop by here, there’s plenty of space and opportunities — pack your bags and do it. You will not regret it.OH: If you want to try Keego — our startup that allows anybody, anywhere to translate — use this discount code to get $20 off of your project: Product Designer and Co-Founder of Keego, a Cincinnati, OH startup that allows anybody, anywhere to translate. 

Türkiye’de start-up kurmak hiç kolay bir iş değil, havada uçağının duran pervanesini çalıştırmaya çalışan şu yandaki adamınki gibi. Bu zor işe kalkışan birinin başvurabileceği hemen tüm yazılı kaynaklar Silikon Vadisinin 50 küsur yıllık geçmişinden beslenen, oranın sorunlarıyla pişmiş kimselerin deneyimlerine dayanıyor. Çok daha kısa olsa da, teknoloji girişimi tarihimiz içinde kendimize göre bir bilgi dağarcığımız oluştu ve artık yabancı kaynakların yanısıra bu yerli bilgileri de aramızda paylaşmalıyız.Türkiye’de 10 yıl önce yerli bir start-up kuracağım, “Aynı uçurumun bir benzeri, teknoloji şirketinde çalışmayı ya da ortak olmayı düşünen bir genç için de mevcut. Çalıştığı start-up’ın anlamlı ve değer üreten bir yapıya dönüştüğünü, içine konan değeri 100le, 300le çarpabilen bir işletme haline geldiğini görmek isteyen yerli beyinler ne yapsınlar? Bugün bu sorunun cevabını ülkesinde bulamadığı için bu diyardan Vadiye göçen gençlerimize kızabilir misiniz?Silikon Vadisi’nde 60larda kurulan yapı, herşeyin sahibinin büyük bankalar ve şirketler olduğu, merkezci Batı sistemine uygun tasarlanmış, ama o sistem içinde bile başka yerde benzeri olmayan bir değer yaratma mekanizmasıdır. Küçük boyutlu, 10–15 kişilik ekiplerle, orijinal bir iş modeli bulmayı başaran tüm teknoloji start-up’larında, mekanizmanın gereği olarak kuruculara ödül olarak bir para ödenir, minik start-up el değiştirir ve hızla binlerce satıcının ve pazarlamacının istihdam edildiği bir corporatation’a dönüştürülür.Yani gerçek gün gibi ortada: Türkiye’nin insan ve KOBİ yapısına uygun bir teknoloji üretme ve değere dönüştürme mekanizmasını, Silikon Vadisi’nden ya da ona benzer bir Batı coğrafyasından kopya olarak alıp buraya getiremeyiz. Kendimize uygun yapıyı bizim bulmamız gerekiyor.Benim Türkiye’de gördüğüm sıkıntı, elle tutulur olmayan herhangi bir şeyin yok sayılmasıyla ilgili. Firmanızın tüm değeri bir kaç yüz bin satır programa sinmiş bir iş modelinde ve proseslerinde saklı. Gelin şimdi bunu muhasebecinize ya da avukatınıza anlatın. Size yatırım yapan kişiler bu değere ortak olmak istiyorlar, ama daha siz bu fikirsel değeri kayıda geçiremiyor, muhasebenize yazamıyorsunuz.Türkiye’de iş yapmaya çalışan bir start-up, kanunlar açısından (Türk Ticaret Kanunu başta olmak üzere) köşedeki kuruyemişçiden farklı değil ne yazık ki. TTK, birinci sayfasından “tacir” diye bir adamla başlar. Tacir, nereden geldiği belli olmayan bir depo dolusu malı kime, kaça satacağını düşünen biridir. Bu kanun da onun kanunudur.Oysa, biz teknoloji start-up’çıları için, ticarete konu olmadan önce üretilmesi gereken ve de elle tutulur tarafı olmayan bir ürün söz konusudur. Kanunun tamamı, ne hikmetse, fikri mülkiyeti aklına bile getirmemiş birileri tarafından yazılmış. Sadece para yatıranın hakları korunuyor, ayni sermaye, fikri sermaye diye bir şey bilinmiyor. Yani siz iki ortaksınız, birisi para koyuyor, diğeri ise yazdığı programları; ikincinin TTK’nda kıymeti yok!Silikon Vadisinde, start-up’ınızın avukatı aldığı parayı haketmek için, şirketin değeri olan fikri korumaya alır. O fikre adeta yeni doğmuş bir bebek gibi özenle ve şefkatle yaklaşır. Çünkü aslolan start-up’ın yatırımcıları ve kurucuları değil, korunması gereken o iş fikridir. Türkiye’de ise gördük ki avukatlar sadece parayı verene, onlara patron gibi görünen kimse ona çalışıyorlar.Bizim ülkede, bir şirketin bankaya yatırılan, kayıtlı sermayesi ne kadarsa, değeri de ancak o kadar olabiliyor (halka açık değilse). Tabii bu durumda da, şirketinizin gerçek değeri defterlerine yazılamadığından, kötü niyetli bir ortak gelip, hileli bir genel kurul yapıp sizi kendi kurduğunuz şirketinizde azınlık hissedar haline getirebiliyor.AtoD entrepreneur

Wondering what’s new in the Lean Startup community? With hundred of thousands of global practitioners, the supply of ideas and best practices is endless. What’s more challenging is finding the right information that will influence positive change within your organization.Every year, our team conducts more than 500 customer development calls to understand what challenges the community is facing. We come across some interesting stories from people who are really making things happen. Here are some of our favorites:It all started with a small group of founders and product enthusiasts who self-aggregated into an online community. With positive feedback from his peers, Hoover decided to transform his email list into a website. Over Thanksgiving weekend in 2013, right after launching his email list experiment, he built Product Hunt’s first website mockup with his team. Today, that MVP has evolved into a thriving online community with more than $7M in funding.Though Ryan is now running one of the hottest startups around, he’s a down to earth guy with some great ideas on how to get things going. Prerna began her startup journey after leaving a job as a management consultant, and launched Yaari, a youth-oriented social network in India. Since then, she’s applied her business and technology skills to build apps like Songify; and after a period of time wandering the world with her husband, arrived at the idea for her new business.Prerna’s vision is to share stories across multiple platforms, including apps, video, and virtual reality. It’s Lean Startup storytelling for the Snapchat generation. After attending the 2014 Lean Startup Conference with 6 of her team members, intrapreneur and product strategist Andrea Hill realized that ReadyTalk needed to hold its emerging business lines to a different standard of success. She shares: “We now use metrics like cost-per-learning and validation velocity to show progress since traditional things like ROI weren’t applicable.”With this approach to establishing and tracking milestones, ReadyTalk launched its beta of UbiMeet.com in March 2015.He’s encouraging his teams to get confident with this gap and recognize that the present is always a stepping stone towards a new opportunity. Dave is at the helm of an experimentation story in the making. He shares: “You need to test your way through this process until you find that crucial connection point.”Three Lean Startup Conference attendees have taken him up on his offer, and that number is growing (we’ve heard that they’re very, very happy). They’re working to build a 21st century government, and improving on processes that typically burden government workers. Their mission is to drive efficiency, transparency, and savings. Want more of these stories?Come hear about them live at the 2015 Lean Startup Conference.

Having b**ls is like knowing how to bike. When you have it, it never goes away for the rest of your life. My name is Sofiane and I’m the co-founder  CEO of First things first, I need to put this into context. Numa’s first round of selection was an online form with a lot of relevant questions about our business, our vision, our team…you know, just the basic questions any investor would ask before giving any more attention to your project.Serious things started here. We had to introduce the Above project, our innovative « personal wellness vaporizer », to a jury. This jury was going to see 100 startups in only one week, so what was the biggest challenge for us ? To be remembered.So we went there and we pitched. The jury obviously liked it and the day after we received an email announcing that we were qualified for the great final.We were very excited to be qualified for this final round, and we wanted to kick-ass so bad for the last presentation. But then, an unexpected email arrived in our mailbox five days before the last presentation. The Numa team asked us a lot of questions about the innovating technology we were developing, when would it be ready, what warranties could we give them …While brainstorming with my partners on the best way to provide them security, we joked around and said silly things like : « and what if we go there and do like Erlich in the TV Show Silicon Valley and put our b**ls on the table ? » That would impress them right ?We did realize that we lost focus on our main goal: Ship our product. A lot of startup in France spend their time and die writing Business Plans, pitching over and over again. We are not one of those, we are So, we came up with the most rational plan : Stay at the office and work hard. We will hurry up to finish the prototype (damn we had only 3 days left), and send a runner deliver it to the jury at the exact time of our pitch, while we pursue our journey to product market-fit. A demo of the product is worth a hundred words.It sounds arrogant right ? But think about it. What better message could we deliver ? We are a startup and we move fast. They had doubts about the technology and they wanted warranties. Ok fine. So we had to make it happen in 3 days. We had no other choice. We don’t have any time to lose on preparing the pitch, we have to deliver. It wouldn’t have been relevant to work on that pitch for 3 days. Instead, we preferred to remove any doubts from their heads on our capacity to deliver.We leveraged our network to help us make it happen. Thanks Guillaume ;)We asked a runner (who is actually a friend) to deliver our package at 5.20 pm at the exact time when we were supposed to pitch.Even if we are rejected, it would have been the best decision we have made, because all we want is work with people that share our culture.Sofiane Belghali, Founder  CEO @ Clopify / AbovePremier club #premium de #ecigarette

Homepage of any start-up, any business creates the first impression on the visitor. First impression is not the most important thing but definitely one of the most important things especially for start-ups in particular, who often only get one chance at making a first impression, and so need to be sure they make a good one.Everyone wants the homepage of their site to be remarkable, memorable and to stick in the visitor’s mind. So here are some points you should always keep in mind if you want to have a perfect landing page for your start-upEvery page has a purpose. What is your homepage’s purpose? to set people on a journey of awesomeness, to wow them, where they just slide through and reach the destination, or get what they were looking for, or at times may be get an unexpected Reward.The idea is to make the workflow as intuitive and as simple as possible with minimum cognitive barriers, where a user clearly gets what you are doing and follows one call to actions that is there on the page.Like, google homepage purpose is to make people search, so it just has one search field .The homepage of google is minimal and it does the work for them. Its simple and meets the purpose, drives what they want the user to do i.e search.You must want the user to do something when it reaches your website. Zero-in on one or at max two such things. These are called Do not give users too many options, that confuses the user and a slight roughness in the experience, or confusion in the visitors mind will directly result in bounced traffic.I have seen websites having homepages with lots of data. Writing down all the features, telling the visitor how good and awesome our product is. It is just like meeting that obnoxious person at the party for the first time, who cannot get enough of herself, who keeps boasting about herself, her accomplishments, and its all about her . You are somehow repelled with such kind of personality. Arent you ?Try to convey the idea in one line and keep a simple call to actions which doesnt let the user think, rather makes him/her do what you want him to do, example: click button to redirect to some other page or do signup etc.The moment you start mentioning However, if you tell them your idea with a beautifully designed homepage, not putting an extra effort to sell, user will go with the flow and do what you want them to do.By keeping it simple with a brand message and ‘cool’ image you can entice people to click to the next page to sign up without badgering them or immersing them in information.Whatever I am saying is not my opinion or psychological phenomenon. This is biological and this is what that drives human behavior which I will explain that in another article.For now, just understand one thing, Features and technology you can put in a separate page. If user is interested to read he/she can read over there.What is an effective page ?Which serves the purpose, does the work that it is supposed to do, or rather make the visitor do, what we want him to do.It can be a Sign Up(User Acquisition) for some sites, Search for some or Simply exploring the product for some sites.You might want to create the Homepage with lots of movements, things floating here and there, All that might look amazing and beautiful, but to check the effectiveness of the page we should definitely rely on results.If a beautifully designed page is not helping people convert, it is good for nothing and you should definitely tweaking the page and A/B test it to achieve best conversions.You will be surprised that the pages that drive the most conversions are not the ones which appear most beautiful to eyes. So don’t go by your whims and fancies, which is a better designed page, check the results, the bounce rates, conversions, signups etc. Let the data decide the best homepage design.Keep it simple, stupid. Don’t show flashy stuff on the homepage. That will just repel the visitor.Build an elegant, professional and clean design to help show off a certain brand personality, or a bright, colorful and creative homepage to help grab the visitor’s attention.Whatever you do, you should know the reason for choosing that particular style.Just follow all these, you would definitely see a great reduction in the bounced traffic which is one of the major issues start-ups are facing.And there is no homepage that is perfect, so keep tweaking things here and there, Keep A/B testing it until you find the perfect page for your start-up website☺Founder Plovist.com, Exitintent.io

A few months into investment banking in New York, I stumbled on an idea and quit my job immediately to pursue it. I couldn’t afford my rent anymore, so I moved in with my co-founders into a tiny apartment and started our adventure.Looking back, that impulsive decision ended up being one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Had I spent more time thinking about it, I might have been scared away.For those of you that are thinking about doing a startup, I wanted to share my thoughts to some questions I had before I started Locket.A lot of stuff. Money. Time. Failure. Relationships. Health.But there are equally as many (if not more) risks in ignoring your own passion. The biggest risk (and my biggest fear) is that ten years from now, I look back and regret about I’ve never heard anyone complain that they worked on a startup that failed. But I’ve heard many complain that they had the same idea as Uber and Instagram, and watched while these ideas grew into real businesses.I have seen many who wait for the ‘best time’ to start a company, but I don’t think there is such a thing. There will always be a reason to wait.In three years, you might have more industry experience. In five years, you might have more money. In ten years, you might have a strong network to support you.These are all good reasons. They are also good excuses. The longer you wait, the more excuses you’ll think of.Unless you are at a point in life where you can’t start a company, put down those books and start making your idea a reality. It’s a much better use of your time.You will make lots of mistakes early on, but you’ll learn much more. It’s like learning how to swim — you can’t without being in the water.Execute your ideas. Make mistakes. Learn. Repeat.Without having been both (female and male), who knows? But you can certainly make it better to be who you are if you are committed to believing it. It’s all about how you frame your perspective.After all, you can’t choose your gender, Ask yourself — what would I do if I were NOT afraid? And, do THAT.Founder  CEO of Locket (

An article got posted on Thought Catalog recently, called I’m not going to criticize them — I’m not going to lie. I read them every time. I don’t love the proliferation of them, but I think they’re a fun read. I usually end up laughing a bit by the end of the list, because of how over the top they are.The problem for me is, this time I didn’t find it very funny. I take issue with the fact that this is seemingly targeted at men, telling them to consider dating a girl who works for a startup. Out of all the lists on Thought Catalog, many career-oriented, the one that’s posted about women in startups specifically is dating advice.I’ve worked with startups, I’ve worked for companies that deal with startups, my very first job out of college was with an atypical sort of startup that worked with construction, and that led into consulting for — you guessed it — more startups. And I mean, I live in Detroit. It’s kind of a common trend here, We We have a problem, in that this is exactly what people think of, when they think of women in startups — dating them, or referring to them as ‘girls’, or assuming they’re ‘not a good fit’ because they’re ‘girls’ and might have ‘distracting relationships’ — instead of hiring them.All of the points listed in the article, as evidence of how dateable the women interviewed are, are reasons that you should So why aren’t more startups, particularly tech startups, trying harder to hire a more diverse workforce, and retain their employees for long periods of time?The answer is Therefore, most of the teams tend to hire employees who are exactly like their cofounders, assuming, like a lot of people do in their personal lives — this will help them get along better, and therefore make the venture more likely to run smoothly. After all, conventional startup wisdom tells you that the more you get along, the more you’ll have a strong team who’ll have each others’ backs and understand each other.The problem with this is, at least around here, the startup teams are now nearly universally white and male. They’re outgoing, optimistic, and play a whole lot of ping pong, to the point where there’s now been several instances of inter-office ping pong Olympics. (We have a ping pong By perpetuating this style of hiring, you’re creating a team of yes-men who think similarly to you. They may have your good qualities, but they also might have all the same faults and blindsides, as well as cultural biases. You might not be able to, say, notice if a product is actually marketable to more than a very small portion of the population. Or maybe your idea isn’t realistically priced. It might be too expensive for most people, or they might not want to set aside more than ten dollars for a web-based service. Great social media interactions and flashy marketing won’t save an idea that nobody’s interested in.The other problem with this is that long hours and modest-to-low pay, which are often used as traits of people who are passionate and involved in their work, exclude people who value interpersonal relationships, or have a family life. If you’re looking to hire within your company culture, and your idea of company culture is “young white guy with no social life who lives for work and only that”, that means you might feel like choosing someone who varies from this threatens your “culture”. However, if you hired someone who has a well balanced personal life and interacts with a wide variety of people, rather than someone who has purely technical skills and ability to speak startup jargon, would mean that your new employee can bring a realistic perspective and ideas about how to better grow your company.So many startups say that they want to change the world. So hire women for your startup. You’ll be glad you did.Designer, illustrator, letterer. Terminally spooky. Typography blogger, occasionally. Social media director at 

You want your next hire to brainstorm ideas, create incredible designs, give attention to detail, be flexible and communicative, have solid architectural experience and coffee lover (nah.. are you kidding me). Do you think a job description which involves a combination of the phrases above is what motivates anyone to join your start-up?Most of the portals leave you with “Job Description” and “How to apply” paragraph inputs. But would you describe your product in that space? Would you write about your team in there? Would just the job description motivate him to make an attempt to contact you?I’ll take you through a few points which are important to generate good response for your job posting.Every start-up has its own ‘hook’, this is mostly to do with why you are doing it. What is it that you are doing, that has hooked you to spend a major part of your life on it? Try to enthuse the hire with that hook.Writing one line about your product is as good as writing nothing. Imagine a call where your applicant tells “Are you **** a mobile B2B startup, founded by successful Tech Entrepreneurs?” I’m sure you now know that, how important a description of product/company is.Product descriptions will try to motivate the applicant towards making a choice to be a part of solving the problem.Assuming you are solving a real problem, and its a big enough problem. If your hire doesnt understand the problem you are solving or doesnt believe in your solution then its of no use having such guys. Spend a decent amount of time writing what is the product about, and why you are pursuing it.Smart people wanting to join your three/hundred person start-up is because of the person you are. Start up is a learning experience and make your hire know what all is he going to learn from your team. Include a small bio of each person in your team while writing a hiring notice and write down three things that the applicant will learn from each person in your team. For a bigger team size you can choose to write about the team he is going to work with.I’ll not spend time on mentioning anything about this, since all postings seem to mention the role. But a detailed role of what you want your applicant to work on would give him a great head start and not “UI ninjas and rockstar coders”. If the role is for a developer then mentioning that “as soon as you join you would be looked forward to integrate backend and frontend” will give the applicant an idea of how seriously you are looking towards hiring a developer.Do not hesitate to mention the compensation you are willing to give. Lets face it that when building a start-up you do not want to face hick-ups with awkward silences when it comes to negotiating a price.Its just to avoid unnecessary conversation when you can have a thought provoking one instead.If you are not able to decide a no. then it would work best if you can give the applicant a range. An intimation of how his growth will affect the compensation would also be an encouraging factor.Being a funded start-up has its own advantages and being bootstrapped is even good too. I am not going to debate on whether you need to be funded or bootstrapped or anything. Whatever you are its good for you to mention it. Knowing that your start-up is funded/bootstrapped gives applicants a trust. Its a matter of trust in the product which is closely related to whats the state of your start-up. I’m sure once you are making a call to a potential employee you will mention that “we are a start up funded by *******” or “we are totally bootstrapped”. But why don’t you make an attempt to mention it in the hiring posting.Its best if you could upload photos of your workplace. Most of the times your hires are workaholics and love start-ups. If you have a great workplace or even a garage, why not upload a photo of your team working in your office?Location is something you mention for sure. But wouldnt you agree agree that just mentioning “London” or “Bangalore” is not enough. Applicant’s want to know where is it in “London” or “Bangalore.” Proximity and surroundings are a real deciding factor when it comes to making a choice of workplace.I am Imran Parvez, a digital Product Designer.

Developers often get pigeonholed, not just into technologies but into the types of companies they work for. If you start out working on financial back-ends for banks or join Microsoft fresh out of college, it is all too easy look up from your cubicle a decade later and realize that you haven’t seen the world. I’ve been fortunate enough to work in several radically interesting and different environments, from special effects studios, to traditional software companies, to professional kitchens. At each stop I’ve learned how to be a better engineer, how to contribute to different types of teams, and, maybe most importantly, about myself. My hope is that by describing my own trajectory and experiences, I can help you figure out whether you should consider giving up your comfortable career at a big company for something as mad as a startup.I started programming back in the 1970s at the age of 12. My dad brought home a model-33 teletype that was connected to the Louisville Board of Education’s Honeywell mainframe, where I could write code in BASIC. Yeah, it was a freaking printer, with a 110-baud modem, and a paper-tape reader. And I was in love. Since the statute of limitations has long since expired, I don’t mind telling you it wasn’t long before I was hacking into computers all over the country — for the pure love of the puzzle. Next came DecSystem-10 assembly programming, and over the next few years I would hang out at Radio Shack stores and the University of Louisville Apple labs — anything to get my hands on computer time. By the time I was 16, my friend Dave and I had a contract to develop accounting software (with a surprisingly sweet user interface) that ended up being used for decades.When I went off to Brown, I hoped that the years of coding under my belt would give me a leg up in the Computer Science department, and it did. I joined Andy Van Dam’s computer graphics group as a freshman, and through that, plus a short stint at UC Berkeley, I made friends that led to 20 years of awesome jobs. If I could tell a young developer one thing, it is that pouring your heart into your work and building great relationships in your career will always open doors for you. I don’t mean that you need to be calculating in how you make friends, simply that if you devote yourself to be a first-rate programmer and a reliable teammate, your friends will want to work with you again wherever they land.My first stop after college was Industrial Light  Magic. I showed up for the interview in a suit, but they hired me anyhow. My friend Eric was the first full-time programmer there and I was the second; prior to that, they had technical directors writing code, which was a scary thing indeed. On my first day at ILM, I got to be on set when the practical effects team blew up the giant warehouse model for Moving on from ILM to Silicon Graphics was a big decision, but in spite of the excitement of the movie business, I was tired of 80-hour workweeks and ready to move on. SGI machines were the workhorses of computer graphics in those days, and once again, I had close friends working there. I joined a team building a set-top box with a ridiculous 3D interface. I had just moved to Milwaukee so I was doing an early experiment in telecommuting and thought it was pretty glamorous to be in my mid 20’s and taking fancy business trips all the time — including the first of several trips to Tokyo because our initial deployment was with NTT. When the set-top box went down in flames, I joined the VRML/CosmoWorlds team that made an early, valiant, and hopeless attempt to bring a 3D graphics standard to the web.It turns out I had joined SGI when both the stock price and hubris were at an all time high. When competitors like NVidia started making graphics boards that were an order of magnitude cheaper, we thought they were toys. While SGI was busy sponsoring Hollywood premiers and its executives were holding company meetings with increasingly dubious levels of fanfare, those competitors ate our lunch and hired away most of the best engineers. I don’t regret my years there at all, but I learned a few important lessons: (1) having the best technology doesn’t mean you will win — and your technology probably isn’t as far ahead as you think it is (2) if what the execs are saying sounds like BS, it probably is and (3) don’t be the one left behind to turn the lights out.Adobe was an entirely different situation. I spent 12 years there as one of the lead engineers (and, briefly, engineering manager) on the After Effects team. After Effects started out as its own small company (CoSA), founded by a group of engineers that I knew from Brown, and then it was acquired by Aldus and in turn snapped up by Adobe. In fact, funny story, when they first started building After Effects and I was at ILM, the team came by to show it to me and my first reaction was “this will never work.” I couldn’t have been more wrong. It grew into a professional tool that hundreds of thousands of people around the world love and use to make their living.My time at Adobe reflected pretty much everything that could be great about working for a big company. I doubt that 1% of engineers have a situation that good. Especially in the early years, we had the best of both worlds. The After Effects team was pretty much autonomous. We knew our customers and built what they needed. We had ownership of our product and control of our destiny. We were a tightly knit bunch that spent lots of time with each other (and later, each other’s families) outside of work. My teammates were brilliant, and we knew each other so well that I think we could communicate whole designs with the raise of an eyebrow. At the same time, the larger company added tons of value. We had job security and stability, great benefits, and work-life balance. And because Adobe makes Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere, we got to build best-of-breed integration with those products, using the same core libraries they were built on.And yet….There were still things that gnawed at me. Big companies can’t help it. There are boring corporate meetings, and increasingly irritating product requirements that come down from on high. Executive whims and people scrambling to figure out which way the wind is blowing and align with it. Corporate buildings are still corporate buildings even when they have really well-stocked candy jars. HR processes so tedious you can actually feel your hair turning gray. Reorgs that left you needing a frequently revised cheat sheet to remember the path from you to the CEO.When you are building desktop, shrink-wrap software, builds and QA and deployment is generally a pretty painful process. We got used to shipping every year or 18 months; even with agile processes there would still be months of excruciating bug fixing at the end of each cycle. And worse, build times could often be 10 or 20 minutes. It is pretty hard to get in the flow as a programmer when you are interrupted for that long on a regular basis.And then there is innovation. Adding a cool new feature to After Effects? No problem at all, I could make that call myself, or over lunch with the team. But starting a new product? You’d better have some serious fortitude because you’ll need to go through N levels of executive review, and you’ll need to prove that it could generate tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Because anything less than that isn’t going to move the needle. Worse, you’ll need to keep proving the same thing every quarter, because incubating a team and a product takes a long time and corporate memory is short. All big companies talk a great game about innovation, but it mostly goes against their inherently conservative DNA.Let me be clear, this has nothing to do with Adobe. The same is true at Amazon or Apple or Microsoft or Google (or Boeing or Ford or Bank of America). But there came a point when I knew it was no longer the best fit for me.I had always had a great love for the creativity and physicality and human connection of cooking, but it never seemed like the right time to take the professional leap from the keyboard to the kitchen. So in 2007 I started When the book was published, I took that as an impetus to leave Adobe, do a book tour, and begin planning my own restaurant. I was excited (and, obviously, terrified) by the unknown in front of me. And still, leaving was painful, primarily because I knew I would no longer see some of my closest friends on a daily basis.And then a funny thing happened on the way to that hypothetical restaurant.It was November 2012, and I was in hot pursuit of the perfect space to set up my $35-per-plate, lunch-only modern vegetarian concept. Sure, the numbers weren’t exactly penciling out but I was determined to make it work. In my morning spin through the web, I saw a note about a startup called The courtship was short and intense. The first week I was hanging out, I built a feature that their contract development house had claimed was more or less impossible. The next week we fired the contract developers and I signed on as CTO.This was a pretty big gamble on everyone’s part. My knowledge of web programming was indistinguishable from zero. I spent a few days with the contract devs before we let them go, and they would say things like “to configure SSO we need to add a route and a controller method and then disable CSRF and return the right headers, but I think there is a gem for that.” It sounded to me like the teacher in Charlie Brown cartoons: “Wahhh wah. Wah wahh dumbledore wahh wah.”Still, programming is programming. Well-factored code is well-factored code. A function call is a function call, whether it executes locally or hits a web API. Any solid developer could make the switch. It took a few months before I felt mostly up to speed, but I’ve come to love modern web programming. For one thing, there are no build times. You can generally see the results of your work as fast as you can reload a web page. Since I’m incredibly impatient, that is only slightly too slow for me. Automated testing is much easier to achieve than it ever was in C++ land. And because web development is so closely associated with open source, there is a worldwide community solving problems together. I was so accustomed to needing a mental map of a proprietary million-line code base and spending hours in a debugger; it is an amazing feeling to jump on StackOverflow and be able to find a solution in minutes.There is a part of me that feels a twinge of loss when I picture my restaurant; it is a romantic vision, expressing that creativity daily and feeding a small group of passionate customers. But, I know all too well the reality of restaurants. Ninety percent perspiration is a lowball figure. I traded that in for a situation where I can work with some of the best, most knowledgeable chefs in the world.At ChefSteps we believe in working with “T-shaped” people. For me, the depth of the T is coding and working with a software team, and the breadth is food and writing and experience growing my own website and book. Although I usually don’t do much more than kibbitz on the actual food here, or try an occasional goofy experiment (iceberg lettuce cocktail, anyone?), my culinary experience is a huge advantage in building applications that work for both the team here and for our users.Beyond the mechanics of code, working at a startup brings a whole different set of joys and challenges than I ever experienced in the corporate world. The entire risk/reward equation is completely different. At a big company, you mostly work on low risk, incremental improvements to grow or maintain your market and keep your customers happy. At a startup, if you aren’t betting the company, you probably aren’t taking enough risk. Because what you’ve built so far simply isn’t valuable enough to be worth protecting. It requires a very different mindset. In the early days that can cause a scary degree of pivoting, but over time you begin to converge and develop momentum as a team towards big, hairy, valuable goals.You quickly realize that every decision you make has tremendous impact. There is no room for red tape, no room for laying back and saying “not my problem.” You are all in this together. You get mad at each other. You make up. You push each other, and find strengths you didn’t know you had. You have each other’s backs. And sometimes you all stop what you are doing and move all the furniture, because there isn’t a facilities department to call.Working at a startup in Seattle has put me in touch with startup culture in general though, and I’ve realized it isn’t homogenous. There is a Silicon Valley-style startup culture (not limited to California) that is almost entirely focused on the “quick kill” mentality. They want to figure out something that no one else has done, market it virally, and make a quick exit. That mindset lends itself to using people. I’ve seen companies that have hired 50 programmers almost as if they hope that one of them will accidentally type Shakespeare, rather than trying to nucleate a team of a few very high-functioning engineers. The hope is those 50 engineers will get them through to the next round of VC and they can lay off the bad ones. This kind of startup isn’t built around any kind of core love for a particular product, just the thrill of money and/or power. I can’t imagine anything more boring.At ChefSteps, we are trying to do something very different. You can see it in where we come from. Just as I came from After Effects, which has been building value since 1993, our founders, Chris and Grant, last worked on CTO of ChefSteps.com

After 12 month of developing, designing, and prototyping, we’ve finally come to the step where we can show the world what we’ve been working on — Oivo is the smallest charger on the go for iPhone. To charge the smartphone, it uses the most widely used batteries, the regular AA type. What’s special about Oivo is its design. It’s so small that it fits on a keychain.It uses neodymium magnets (credit card and smartphone safe) to hold the halves together when it’s not in use and to hold the batteries in place when it’s charging.Four weeks before the Kickstarter launch, we made a simple landing page and started collecting emails.We knew that getting relevant emails from people that are interested in your project and want to be notified when we launch the product on Kickstarter is crucial, but we still weren’t finished pimping our Kickstater campaign page (making the video and making lifestyle product shots), so we couldn’t really concentrate on getting media exposure. Luckily, we ended up on Beta List and Product Hunt, which both drove some quality visitors to us.I wanted to get some traffic right away, so I paid to jump the line and get the It was definitely money well spent. The average CPC for an early technology adopter relevant for Oivo on Facebook is And without Beta List, we probably would not have been featured on Product Hunt.A week after our Beta List post, we were very surprised when we found out somebody from Tel Aviv recommended us on Product Hunt, and we immediately noticed the increase in buzz on Twitter.We were constantly on the top 10 products that day, but never on top, always around the sixth to eighth place, but we were still getting up-votes and visitors. More importantly, we collected roughly We received a total of We launched on Kickstarter. Ocean rower and sea kayaker. I like to make things. It’s the miles, not the years.

Muito tem se falado sobre criar soluções centradas nas pessoas, que precisamos ter produtos relevante para a vida delas, que é preciso ouvir os usuários e fazer pesquisas. Não tenho dúvidas de que precisamos de tudo isso. Mas ao olharmos a quantidade de ferramentas e entregáveis da área de UX é necessário saber quais e quando usar cada uma delas.Se você ainda não conhece os entregáveis de UX, pode conferir aqui: Ultimamente tenho visto startups brasileiras trabalhando cada vez melhor a experiência do usuário de seus produtos. Por isso resolvi investigar mais a fundo e trocar ideias com profissionais de algumas das maiores e mais conhecidas startups brasileiras para entender como eles têm se movimentado em relação à adoção de UX no fluxo de trabalho delas.Conversando com elas percebi uma coisa em comum: Para testar viabilidade e hipóteses sobre os produtos, as entrevistas com potenciais usuários antes do desenvolvimento e testes com protótipos navegáveis em html ajudam as empresas a sentir de perto as necessidades e ganhar feedbacks valiosos sobre o produto.Algumas vezes as startups (não só no Brasil, mas no mundo todo) surgem com soluções que atendem a uma necessidade de seus próprios fundadores, como no caso das plataformas MOOC (Massive Open Online Course). Diego Alvarez (da EasyAula) e Matt Montenegro (da Beved), por exemplo, também são professores na própria plataforma que criaram. Outro exemplo é o da Bel Pesce (da FazInova), escritora do Best Seller “A Menina do Vale”: ela mesma ajuda a abastecer a plataforma com aulas e conteúdos dos seus livros sobre empreendedorismo. Isso acaba ajudando na construção e evolução, já que os próprios fundadores são usuários do produto e por isso conseguem validar certas hipóteses e fazer melhorias.Porém para as empresas precisam ser relevantes não só para seus fundadores, precisam estar em contato com seus usuários, fazendo pesquisas quantitativas, qualitativas e testes de usabilidade. É importante adequar todos os pontos de contato para que a experiência seja agradável independente da plataforma que for acessada.Fico otimista de ver tanta gente empenhada em fazer com que ideias que parecem simples se tornem serviços prazerosos, mas para isso existe muito trabalho por trás de apps, sites ou plataformas. Mas no final o que importa é gostar do que se faz, e aproveitar esse momento que estamos vivendo de inovação e oportunidades.Se você também aplica UX na sua empresa, comente e compartilhe o que tem feito. ;)Founder  Lead Designer Algumas coisas que aprendemos ajudando a construir novos negócios.

Vai fundar uma startup ou já fundou uma? Então reforço esta dica que considero valiosa: A ideia deste post surgiu durante o almoço no evento Case2014 em um bate papo sobre processos e otimizações com amigos também fundadores de startups. Percebemos que existem alguns serviços que são quase que padrões para a grande maioria de startups, então resolvi uni-los aqui, para facilitar a vida de quem está começando.Durante o desenvolvimento de sua startup vai ser cada vez mais necessário organizar o fluxo de trabalho, demandas, alocações, etc… Por isso, desde o começo, mesmo que seja só você na equipe, use ferramentas que vão te ajudar a se organizar e não esquecer de nada.

A versão gratuita é para quem tem até 2mil contatos, sem limite de disparos, ótimo para quem está começando.Quer montar uma landing page para captar leads ou fazer uma pesquisa com seus clientes? O Typeform é uma solução bela e prática. Te ajuda a criar qualquer tipo de formulário, sempre apostando no design e experiência do usuário, o que torna os forms criados nele muito menos chatos de responder.Outro serviço também muito funcional é o Já que uma hora sua startup vai começar a lucrar (ufa…), você precisa deixar suas finanças bem organizadas. Além disso, não há nada melhor para um investidor quando ele vê que além de uma ideia boa, uma execução e time impecável, a startup sabe controlar os recursos que têm em mãos. Por isso, indicamos o Conta Azul, sistema simples e prático que vai te ajudar com todos aqueles números, entradas, saídas, fluxo de caixa, etc, etc… e ainda vai permitir que os sócios e investidores possam acompanhar tudo em tempo real e de qualquer lugar.Atender seus clientes com agilidade é o que todas as empresas deveriam fazer. Por isso, é preciso definir um processo simples de atendimento o quanto antes possível, e o Zendesk pode lhe ajudar com isto, ele é perfeito para todos os tamanhos de empresas. Nele, os atendimentos são tratados como tickets, e eles podem ser iniciados do seu site, da sua central de dúvidas, de um tweet feito para a sua empresa e de muitos outros canais.

Most of time, we focus on the book as communication device and what the book has to do to be effective or entertaining, but what continues to need more emphasis is that fact that books are also entrepreneurial endeavors and entrepreneurs are successful when they can find customers willing to separate themselves from their hard earned money. Authors need to think more in these terms.In my speciality of business books, authors are normally supported by some other work whether it be consulting, speaking, or running a organization and the book is a way to further their existing goals. This means higher fees, more events, or a substantial promotion. In fiction, a successful books can lead to fellowships, teaching posts and increased sales of prior works. As Ray Bard at Bard Press says, “You don’t make money from the book, you make money as a result of the book.”But if someone proposed that you spend a year developing a new product and then get paid $2.50 for each one you sold, few would pursue that option. It would be delusional, quixotic quest. Yet that is exactly what you are signing on for when you choose to be an author.Authors should act more like entrepreneurs. You need to already have customers for whatever idea you plan on selling as a book. If someone isn’t paying you to speak, consulting, or lead using your idea, you shouldn’t write a book about it. You can certainly start a blog and lead a tribe as a route to writing a book as well.When you take the audience from some nebulous group of people you think you can help to a set of individuals who are already paying you for the same help, the audience you are writing for becomes clear. The problems they experience appear. The language they use surfaces. And if you provide the right inspiration, they lead you to others with the same hopes for their future.The following is a quote from the research Saras Saravathy who has been doing into the ways entrepreneurs make decisions. This is from an actual entrepreneur:What if we changed a couple of words to put a publishing spin on this:Whether we like it or not, every book is a start-up.Dustin Kurtz, marketing manager at Melville House, As someone who has helped The chain started with Prompted by the post, Kurtz’s discomfort seems to be the always present tension between art and commerce. Whenever commerce suggests a different process for art, the literati cry foul. Suggesting a more open writing process, for example, automatically means that a book will end up written for the reader of the least-desirable denominator or as Kurtz describes, “tailoring a book to a focus group the way companies might test out an ad-spot for antacid.”When Tom Wolfe started writing Bonfire of the Vanities, he was not holed up in a writer’s colony. He shared the manuscript he was writing on the pages of Rolling Stone, releasing 27 installments over the course of a year. Wolfe called the serialization “a very public draft.” He spent two more years revising the novel before Bonfire of the Vanities was released as a book in 1987, to critical acclaim and commercial success. Charles Dickens used the same process for every one of his novels and we know through reading correspondences he had with illustrators and colleagues that the development of those stories was impacted by their feedback and the feedback of the reading public. At SXSW Interactive 2013, I heard Steve Carpenter, the creator of the TV show Grimm, talk about how he changed the ending to his novel Killer after fans didn’t like the first one he wrote. “I wanted to make the readers happy,” he said.The most important concept we can learn from what is happening in today’s startup movement is the art of exposing our ideas to the world and listening for their response. The mantra “Get out of the building” from startup patriarch Steve Blank tells entrepreneurs that the answers they are looking for are not going to be found in front of their computers or talking amongst themselves. Matt Mullenweg, the founder of Automattic, goes even further saying, “You can never anticipate how an audience will react to something you’ve created until it’s out there. That means every moment you’re working on something without it being in the public it’s actually dying, deprived of the oxygen of the real world.”Kurtz writes, “Are we to the point where the act of being alone, writing to an imagined audience and not a real responsive audience is akin to hiding?”Yes, that is precisely what we are saying.Art for art’s sake is fine, but if we are going to introduce the notion of commerce and the idea that someone is going to pay for the artist’s work, then it is completely reasonable to suggest a different process to evaluate and commercialize the work. In writing I don’t understand Kurtz’s objections. These expressions are not metaphors, they are business terms being used to describe the business of publishing. Publishers are venture capitalists who assemble a portfolio of projects to mitigate financial uncertainty of publishing books. Authors are entrepreneurs who bring an idea and, in the words of Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham, are “relentlessly resourceful” in their drive to succeed. And books themselves are startups in search of an audience, competing for attention in a very crowded marketplace of ideas.Founder of BizBookLab--studying business books and the business of books.

This post was originally posted on my blog — The most disruptive word in Startup Ecosystem is ‘disruption’. Its used / abused / misused by almost everyone — entrepreneurs, investors, advisors, mentors, press and so on.Founders love to call their product / startup as disruptive and so do investors who keep saying they are looking for disruptive ideas, both have very limited explanation of what disruptive startup actually means for them or they run out of examples or ideas when you ask them what exactly is disruptive about it. Most of the answers are — ‘If this becomes big, it could disrupt the market’.This is a random post, not intended to draw any conclusion or summary but sharing few things I have learned about disruptive startups and ideas. Probably also on how to get ideas to build your next big ‘disruptive’ start-up.Early 2008, I moved in my new role at These were the early days of Ecommerce and to say we were not innovating then would be wrong. To bring up more users to Ecommerce, COD (Cash On Delivery) was introduced. To expand reach beyond (limited) online audience, experiments like Reader’s Offers (in Newspapers) were attempted by many. We introduced real-time customer support calls to users who dropped out during checkouts and assisted conversions via IVRs. Debit Cards were integrated. Top 20% products in top 20 cities were delivered in less than 3 days. Back then, all major players were marketplaces — that involved a lot of co-ordination with vendors / sellers for inventory, logistics, deals, order status and operations.Few days into my new role a colleague mentioned to me about a new service — In 2008, books sold on any ecommerce service took 6-10 days to dispatch (most of them had common vendors) and books that required procurement from US took 25 days on a minimum side (and customers used to wait!). Flipkart was quickly dismissed as a niche website, and books contributed to a smaller percentage of overall business. In fact there was a time that competition was more worried about By end of 2009 I moved out of Rediff. And over time I started ordering books (and then other products) much frequently on Flipkart and was never disappointed by its service. I knew friends and colleagues were admiring loving it too. Flipkart kept growing and so did the word of mouth for them. So what did Flipkart do differently to disrupt Ecommerce? Instead of marketplace approach, it started off as a self-managed service. It picked up Books — the most under-served category then (under-served, but large — in 2008 Rediff Books had 1.2 Million Titles listed). It used most simplest channel for $0 marketing — Search Engine Optimization. Adding a million books to Google Index (this is in 2008) in a category that had less than 10 players helped them rank up well. And they rarely did goof up on delivery, dispatch or customer experience.That was Flipkart. And the story about ‘disrupting a industry’ by a startup or underdog remains similar across the world. Startups / Entrepreneurs don’t disrupt a industry or vertical by ‘launching just another product’ in existing market. There needs to be aAnother example in Indian context is Coming back, a This probably is true for almost every big startup or product that is out there today.In India context, Examples that come to my mind are — Travel (Vacations — it is still an broken and under-served market), Matrimony (Nothing has changed in this vertical for more than 10 yrs, however people and culture has changed a lot), Classifieds (Largely served by few players and the model hasn’t evolved much) and so on.Some markets are so big that there is room for multiple big players — Fashion being one of them. Some of the verticals just came online (Online Grocery  Vegetables) but are struggling to grow, maybe they need to approach differently.One of my favorite examples here is Look for large products that are ageing fast and its early users are complaining or it fails to provide value to them.Some of the examples, More directions — Facebook was default private product; then came Twitter that was default public product. There is lot of opportunity for both products to reverse privacy. For example, Twitter is a public identity to many people, its private aspect ie. direct messaging is massively broken. Forget private product, even Twitter as a public conversation platform is also broken or difficult to explain to new users. Twitter itself is Look for large products that serve multiple purposes. Perfect one of their use-cases.Best example here is Facebook. Large products like One of my favorite examples here is Also recently Zuck announced ‘Look for broken / boring experiences in the products around you that are in daily use. Broken, because you can fix them. Boring, because you can make them cool (or add value).This probably over laps the above mentioned use-cases. Mobile OS features like Camera got replaced by PS: The biggest broken experience on phone or devices today is battery / charging. And this is a tough one!If you are too much into technology news look for changes around you and a need for product that you could build because of market changes and opportunities that come up.Another big blow was when Google decided to My favorite example here is ——————How to find Disruptive Ideas for Startup?Listing down the 5 methods mentioned above:Wait, your existing startup does not fit in the above criteria? Nothing to get disheartened with, this is just a reference point. In fact I also realized that my own startup does not fit in thisSome takeaways,Drive Product + Growth 

Cela fait 10 mois que l’on existe, et cela fait 9 mois que nous avons entamé les discussions avec nos partenaires : les Restos du Coeur.Il y a 9 mois, notre plateforme Recipay venait de naître avec peu de marques, peu de membres et un concept qui a fait lever pas mal de sourcils.Quand on a créé Le Food fait tourner le monde, mais il fait tellement défaut à un grand nombre de personnes. Les familles, les jeunes et moins jeunes, les parents célibataires qui font la queue aux Restos du Coeur. Les aides et les dons s’amoindrissent : ce sont des sujets qui à travers nos parcours respectifs nous touchent mon associé et moi-même. Autant le dire, on croit que changer le Monde, ce n’est pas avoir un énième nouveau service de messagerie instantanée, mais c’est plutôt améliorer la vie de tout le Monde.L’approche est simple : les internautes proposent des recettes qui intéresseront les bénéficiaires des Restos du Coeur, mais, cette fois, avec leur accord et leur soutien. Au lieu de les rémunérer, nous donnerons cet argent aux Restos du Coeur. Donc oui, nous donnerons bien 10€ par recette validée aux Restos du Roeur, pas 1€ ou un pourcentage qui finit en cents : nous donnerons TOUT.Oui, 20 000 repas, c’est une goutte dans l’océan de repas que proposent les Restos chaque année, mais ça nous parait une vraie participation..et si on les dépasse…alors on les dépassera.On a de la chance, notre startup fait du chiffre d’affaires, on ne se paie pas (encore), on réinvestit tout, on travaille dur.Oui, on a pris 15 min avec mon associé avant de s’engager, on s’est posé la question de l’avenir, que peut-être, c’était un peu dingue…Je ne suis pas certain que cela aurait été aussi simple.Et vu que c’est notre boîte, on se bouge et on vit en conformité avec nos principes. Pour nous, c’est important de redonner. Notre première verticale concerne le food et l’alimentation, il nous semble tellement naturel de ne pas attendre et d’agir en phase avec nos convictions, de se dire que oui, nous sommes une société qui a pour but de faire des profits (on en fait) et de montrer notre culture d’entreprise à travers nos actes.Montrer de quoi on est fait tout simplement.Pendant des années les internautes ont partagés sur les gros sites de recettes, les réseaux sociaux et les plateformes leurs recettes de cuisine pour rien…enfin si pour permettre aux supports de vendre de la pub inefficaces et en lésant totalement leurs auteurs…Sur Recipay, on achète le contenu, car il a de la valeur,Avec les Restos du Coeur, vos contenus ont de la valeur pour les autres, c’est encore mieux que de les laisser “gratuitement”, demain ils vont aider les familles, ça, c’est du média social.Depuis que nous avons imaginé Recipay et notre plateforme de crowdsourcing qui paiera in fine tous les internautes pour tous leurs contenus, nous sommes épatés du travail, des contenus de nos presque 10 000 membres : des recettes, des collaborations en famille, de nombreux échange sur Twitter, Facebook et chaque échange par email est une véritable source d’enrichissement pour nous.“On ne voit bien qu’avec le coeur”.

Six months ago, my young family and I took the decision to go and live in Copenhagen.Instead of being overwhelmed at the prospect of moving country, as well as recently becoming a father, I decided it was the perfect opportunity to start my own (I had previously been working in a corporate company in London, however I was exposed to the tech startup scene around Silicon Roundabout due to a previous venture that I had explored in my free time. I joined the co-working space The thing I loved best about the tech startup world was the creative and free thinking atmosphere, and the fact that people loved their jobs, loved their work and And everyone was so welcoming! The atmosphere was so inclusive, that even when I turned up on my own, within minutes someone would have taken the time to talk to me and make me feel like a part of this incredible community.I was moving to Copenhagen, so after finally freeing myself from the chains of the corporate world, I was not going to get to experience the joys of being a fully fledged active member of London’s startup community.I was going to a City where I knew Most worrying was that I didn’t even know where to start looking for anyone. I had no idea if there was a tech startup scene in Copenhagen.I quickly did a little research into what was going on over there and came across an article on The Next Web about how A week before I was due to arrive in Copenhagen, I decided to email a couple of the founders of some of the places and startups that were mentioned in the article, explaining how I was moving to the City and could we meet for a coffee when I arrive. Guess how many said “yeah, sure”?I experienced the same welcoming feeling that I got the first time I went to I started attending a couple of events here and there and gradually met more people in the Copenhagen startup community, however I was still looking for a place to work from.Then about a month in, I was grabbing a coffee with someone I had a met at one of the events, and I explained that despite there being a good number of co-working spaces in Copenhagen, they were all a bit out of my budget as I had literally just started up and couldn’t justify the cost of office space at that moment.His response? After being the recipient of such warm and welcoming acts, I decided that I wanted to give something back to the startup community of Copenhagen.I thought back to that week before I came here, and how I was looking to find out what was going on over here in Copenhagen, and I thought about, what if people were not comfortable with reaching out to strangers via email like I did, how would they be able to meet like-minded people and others in the start-up scene and get themselves up and running?And finally I thought about how I first met people back in London, That was it! That’s what was needed in Copenhagen, a place where people would know they could go to meet others like them, a place where everyone is welcomed, a place where you can start to meet people and get involved in the scene, I tweeted 3beards and told them that they had inspired me with Silicon Drinkabout and that I was setting up something similar here.This was the start of a dialogue which led to the first official expansion of Silicon Drinkabout outside of London and I am now a proud founding organiser of I have been running this for three months now with the help of fellow startup community lover People have started to say “thank you” to us for holding this event, which shows that the importance of a regular and consistent event for the community should not be underestimated, even if fundamentally it is just meeting for a drink and a chat.After having such amazing experiences in London and Copenhagen it has really pressed home the importance of community to me and I work hard to create initiatives and events that benefit not only existing members, but people who are looking to get involved in this area.As well as setting up Silicon Drinkabout, I have set up an online platform through I want to do for others, what others have done for me, and that is an incredibly strong motivation to have and one which I hope stays with me.If I had never been made to feel welcome at Silicon Drinkabout in London or if no one had taken the time to have a coffee with me when I moved to Copenhagen, then it is possible that these events and initiatives which I have added to the community here would not exist.And it’s also possible that I would still know no one, • Entrepreneur and blogger • Find me on Twitter Life is made of stories.

It was an amazing and exciting week for our community of Female Founders on In this post I gather some of the most relevant moments of the conversation with Fran, showing how easy and elegant can be this kind dynamics on Slack. I really love how Slack is changing the way we share knowledge and interact in online communities. One of the biggest limits of traditional networking events and conferences -apart from the geographical barriers obviously, if you are not living in the Bay Area for example- is that very few people are able to engage and connect directly with the speakers. This is why I believe that Slack communities like #FemaleFounders are democratizing the access to knowledge, offering a unique opportunity to their members to share their worries and curiosities in a more spontaneous and free way.I’m working on the following AMAs, and I’d love to hear from you which successful entrepreneur or investor you may like to have as a guest in our next QAs.

“Back in the 1990s,” says Boora, who grew up in Hyderabad, a large city in southern India, “people in India liked to say, ‘You shouldn’t go into computer science because we don’t know the future of these machines.’ Computers started catching on in the mid-’90s. I was introduced to it pretty late—I got my first computer at 18. It’s a bit of a handicap if you compare to the same generation here. They were exposed to technology much earlier.”As I badger him with questions, Boora explains almost apologetically, “I’m not completely outspoken. I’m kind of shy, mostly because of cultural differences. Everyone is an immigrant in this country, but after nine years in the U.S., I‘m still trying to adjust.” He continues:Boora, who had duly entered a course of study in mechanical engineering at Boora completed his undergraduate education and moved to the United States in 2004 for a masters program in CS at the Boora was at the social networking giant for nearly three years, learning everything he could about scalability. As a back-end engineer, he worked on activity stream scaling and building a real-time analytics platform. He has a honed sense of the rise and fall of social networks based on how they handle growth:“When MySpace began extensive layoffs, Boora headed north to the Bay Area to join Of his career trajectory, he observes, “I really like fast-paced environments. I love taking risks, and I want to be challenged.” Boora, who grew up playing badminton and cricket in India, also has a passion for what he calls “adrenaline-rush activities: skydiving, rappelling, go-karting. I’ve gone skydiving eight times.” He makes the connection between these activities and his professional predilections. “I’m crazy about startups, where you work on something from the ground up and are part of a small team,” he reflects. “It’s like an adrenaline rush.”When he arrived at Medium, Boora got started on the back-end mechanics for search. “It was on my mind since I got the job offer,” he says. He has worked on refactoring back-end components and tools and delved into the platform’s cross-posting feature and homepage algorithm for trending posts.Medium, he notes excitedly, “puts the focus mainly on content by taking away all of the unnecessary things from the writer. It’s quickly becoming the place to write on the Internet.” He adds, as if to explain his excitement,I design all the words. Narrative UX at 

Many who ride feel pity for those who don’t. A panoramic view of the world bleeds past you. You smell the crisp cool air rushing against your skin. Your senses are heightened. There’s a feeling of laser focus that overwhelms you. You know that this level of awareness is necessary since there’s a level of danger that you’re now exposed to. You’re completely aware of this danger, but for some reason, you’ve never felt so calm. Feelings of danger, freedom, excitement, and peace are all experienced in a single ride.Not too long ago I purchased my own place in Atlanta, living close to my family and many old friends. I had a well paying job that allowed me to adopt a fairly decent lifestyle. My We were aware of the “dangers” ahead, but it didn’t matter to us. It was clear that there was nothing else we’d rather do than to create something that we were passionate about.We had to rely on our skills, and we had to hone new ones. There’s no other way about it when you’re faced with the prospect of failure. All of this had to be mixed with determination, focus, and the right amount of luck. If we messed up along the way we’d have to analyze what went wrong and why, and how we could prevent similar mistakes in the future. Everyday we learned something new that we hadn’t have had the chance to learn before. We used data and constant feedback from our customers to make sure that we were building something that people wanted. Even though we knew the future was full of unknowns, our level of excitement, determination, and focus kept us going.Riding demands that you pit your skill and a little bit of luck to make sure that you don’t fail. If your tires are cold and go into a corner too fast you may lose traction and low-side. If you experience target fixation you might ride directly into a guardrail, even though you know you’re trying to avoid it. If you’re lucky, you get a chance to analyze and prevent the same mistakes from happening twice. Motorcycling demands a level of focus that you don’t normally experience when you’re behind the wheel of a car. You’re forced to be constantly aware of your surroundings when you realize that One of the benefits of working on your motorcycle is being able to make minor adjustments and then immediately noticing the difference it makes in your ride. I can adjust the stiffness of my bike’s suspension so that I’m able to go into a corner with more confidence. I can adjust the free-play on my clutch to make my shifts smoother. Every little fix or tweak I make directly affects the way that my bike rides. This is very similar to everyday decisions at a startup. Even the smallest changes to our product can make noticeable differences. On a higher level, adding the Motorcycling is a solitary experience but you’ll quickly realize that you’ve never before been so connected to the world around you. You’re not alone when somebody is walking on the sidewalk. They’re walking by When I got my motorcycle many were wondering why I ended up doing such a No matter how hard we may try, many people will never understand why we put ourselves at a greater risk while commuting when there are safer, simpler alternatives available.In the same way, many will never understand why somebody will leave everything to start something of their own. Why would somebody voluntarily subject themselves to that level of risk and danger? Why would you leave the simplicity and convenience of your job to work harder and for less money? Why would you break out of your simple day-to-day routine and force yourself to learn and experience so much in so little time? Why would you knowingly subject yourself to insane highs and lows?Simply put, because there’s nothing else like it.There are people who simply can’t relate without experiencing it for themselves.

Originally posted on I’m 24 years old. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Economics and during 2013 I’ve worked with 3 startups. There’s something wrong with this path, right? Where are the corporate firms?Working on a startup isn’t the fairy tale that you probably listened to from what I call fake-preneur — those guys who talk non-stop but really have nothing concrete to tell. Please do me a favor and forget them. Working on a startup is very hard and a task that not many are able to take on.Disclaimer made. Now, I can start telling you about my story.I don’t consider myself a startup expert and I’m not at all a successful entrepreneur. However, my experiences throughout 2013 gave me a lot of valuable insights that (I’m sure) will be interesting to someone else reading this.Throughout 2012, I’ve worked in a huge company with expanding resources, well-established and good career opportunities. What I call today the ‘dark side of the force’ seemed to me a good place to be. But, that ended with me quitting even before the internship contract ended.After that brief passage, I’ve also started attending a master’s degree. But, quickly, I understood that it wasn’t really for me and so I became a master’s dropout.So, within just 3 months, I gave up a promising career that I’ve studied for many years and my family and friends were expecting me to walk on. Fortunately, during the short period I was taking the master, I started out as intern on During 4 months I worked essentially to hack growth (crucial tasks as the platform was launched in the first days of my internship). For the very first time I understood what meant working on a startup:I just loved it.For the first time I felt that I was doing what I liked, at the right place and with the right people. What I learned in four months was well beyond what I learned in my short corporate experience. Probably it was even beyond what I learned during all the years I spent at university. There’s nothing better than getting your hands dirty and feeling what the real world is like.My second experience working in a startup was a short-term contract with a full-time hire possibility. For the first time it was paid work on a startup. Yes, there are startups out there paying salaries! It was also the first time where I exactly knew what my job description was — managing everything digital and most of the customer relationship (community management). Plus, one of the founders and CEO of Once again, it was an incredible experience. A couple of months looked like a whole year as so much stuff took place within this short period of time. Believe me: this feeling is almost impossible to get outside the startup world. However, do you remember me saying that this isn’t a fairy tale? Yes, I ended up quitting the job. But the important thing to takeaway is that this is hard — this was one of the most difficult decisions I’ve already taken and it’d never happen in a corporation since it happened as a result of my strong involvement in the company.By this time I was mingled inside the Portuguese startup community as result of other initiatives that I got involved in the past months. And so, in spite of having second thoughts after quitting a job that I really liked, I was sure of two things:The team is small (and still is) and the tasks and responsibilities are huge. The odds are overwhelmingly against us — typically just a small percentage of the startups that receive seed investment succeed within a 5-year period; we aren’t running a company, we are scaling it — the amount of effort from our team is great. And, Today I’m able to say that I do what I love with people I like and respect. Despite the fact that I’m wearing multiple hats many times and of having no idea of where I’ll be 5 years from now, I love it.—Founder  COO at 

In a Portland office, the home of Treehouse, I get to see Andrew Chalkley as the first early-bird to come in and talk about his work. The geek-chic surrounding seems to be on the verge on getting crowded with people, but for the remaining early hour, only the co-founder Alan Johnson seems to be a presence in the background. Probably making sure everything is on track. As I get to find out from Andrew ‘Andrew Chalkley is a tech-savvy teacher who strikes me as a happy, sunny person. Getting up earlier than usual and enjoying a diet coke, he tells me about himself and his experience “Trying to get to the basics of their work, I ask Andrew who replies very easily “Looking at the social profiles of Treehouse, there’s nothing resembling binary code. It speaks in warm terms of helping people achieve their goals and changing the world. It’s the honest description that I got and putting things in a larger picture that really seems to make a difference. This juxtaposition of people’s dreams before the trainings seem to build their culture and keep everyone involved ready to achieve more. Andrew adds “Listening to statements like that make you think that Andrew doesn’t resemble a teacher from a brick and mortar institution; not anyone that I have met. Changing a slide or altering something in a course is usually not a short turn-around in an university, people follow different incentives. And that triggers my immediate question It may be the process, the content or finding alternate teaching ways that fill the hole in technological education and have a chance in other places. But I get the feeling it is more than that, it is the commitment I get to see in the teachers, to do more research, contemplate on the bigger picture and try to adhere to outside affairs. Which gets us to the issue of employment.“As I talk more with Andrew about education and career paths, I also find about his early days. Despite his English accent, he seems to inherit a Silicon Valley genetic optimism about the social impact of technology. Coming from North of UK into the States, he had to prove his skills and knowledge. Describing a variety of activities, from meet-ups to projects and personal startups, Andrew seems to follow a roller coaster ride I saw in most entrepreneurs. “So how do you get in the front lines? By pushing yourself and getting experience. But that’s a vague statement for people who are not used to hustle. A more practical approach is to try some things out, try to get a feel for it or see where a track gets you. Literally, at Treehouse you have tracks. For example, if you want to experiment with Front End Web Development, you can follow the track that gets you started with HTML and CSS and then adds a bit of JavaScript. The same thing goes for iOS, Android and Ruby. Andrew talks about how they are also preparing Java and Python tracks while trying to approach a segment with a focus on corporate jobs.Eager to present my team’s work to someone more experienced, I show Wow, that was such a hard thing to explain to my parents, about trying to put things on the Internet designed for the Internet. But then, talking to people like Andrew, you immediately get a validation. And not just on the product, but the path you took, of trying to build something and get experience that you couldn’t get from a sit down institute.Asking for advice, I get a very structured one regarding the whole experience of getting something out the door and into the real world. “And sometimes you may end up out of the Ps flow and fail, and that is ok too because “The root word for technology comes from the Greeks and its spelled ‘techne’, meaning ‘art’. The ancients didn’t separate the art from craftsmanship in their mind, so they didn’t feel the need to create two separate terms. A long time has passed since and we’ve seen almost everything put in a category or another, but there’s this feeling that remained and the lucky ones still get to experience it with their work. Like Andrew puts it Technology in itself is making things and cannot be good or wrong on its own; people in the industry seem to get it and make it a journey for themselves and the others. Behind the mantras of I found myself very enthusiastic after chatting with Andrew. It’s talks like this that raise your spirits a little and make you think that things are going in the direction you are heading. And education, technology and your startup will probably get better.Tools to build better websites: 

Once you take the leap of faith into entrepreneurial lifestyle and make the decision to start a business, you must choose a name for your company. When starting my first company, I was completely unaware of the intricate logistical details associated with picking a name for a company. Here’s some advice to save you money and time when choosing a name for your startup.Naming a company is different for everyone. It comes naturally to some founders, but can also be the most difficult decision in the startup process for others.A name is important, but rarely will make or break a company. Some companies name themselves after fruit. Others prefer animals. Some try to be witty and have their name metaphorically represent their product. Others name themselves after their deceased dog.Whatever your preferred naming method is, you must ensure two things (in this order) before investing too much time and money into branding and incorporating under that given name:My first tech startup had to change its name three times because of trademarking issues. It is important to make sure this is handled prior to investing too much in both domains and branding, because if you accidentally infringe on someone else’s trademark you will likely be forced to rebrand in the future which can have a fatal impact on an established company.Unfortunately, the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) does not give a flying fuck about how different you are from some other random company with a similar name in a similar industry. Let’s face it, the government will always be behind when it comes to technology (as depressing as typing that statement is), so it is integral to get a trademark lawyer to help you research into obtaining a trademark on the name and logo of your new company. It‘s hard for a fledgling bootstrapped startup to justify this cost, but unless you’ve been to law school, it is a necessity. Do not use Legalzoom unless your company’s name is incredibly obscure. My general rule of thumb for this: if the .com is available, you can use Legalzoom or a similar service, but if not, get a damn trademark lawyer.With my first startup, I quickly learned about the evil nature of domain squatters. If you’ve never heard of them, they are people who registered (primarily .com) domains and just wait for a person or company to need that specific domain. Generally, the more generic the word, the more likely a domain squatter (or a company already in business) owns the .com domain. Domain squatters with very generic domains can make literally millions of dollars off of a single domain. For example, Sex.com recently sold for $13 million.So my advice to you if you are bootstrapping and do not have funding, choose a name where you can register either the .com or .co from the start, without having to bring in domain brokers to attain an already registered domain. You can use a service called Because I did not know this until joining the tech startup scene, there are many country codes that startups use in their name to help get around the problem of domain squatters on the popular .com domains. Many creative startups incorporate the country code suffixes into their name. Bottom line, don’t waste too much time choosing a name for your company. However, do spend the time necessary to make sure you can trademark the name and purchase a domain. This simple process will save you countless time and money. You’ll thank me later.Growth/Product at Beyond Pricing.

I love thinking of ideas and putting them out there to see the response so I could come up with solutions of how I would make them work.#student — I posted an idea to have a platform for students to post ideas, get feedback and collaborate with others in similar situations on their ideas. A pre-ProductHunt, if you will. Got some good feedback, then I got lost in whatever else I was doing and left it to the side.In comes Daniel Kempe (DK [So I chirped up “Hey, I had the exact same idea”…and then we all chatted about how this could work, potential problems, opportunities then moved to a private group.Got all the niceties out of the way.Perfect.

So why would we do the opposite of what we are promoting? DUH!Let’s get the landing page  Typeform out there — gather info and feedback on what our target audience would want and THEN build the platform. We can use InVision and a dedicated Slack group (just thought of that — 10:18AM, 21/01/2015) to get our own feedback.We want to integrate closely with Twitter and encourage sharing of positive and negative feedback so that it can reach a wider audience — also jumping on the trend of Transparency! People like to be part of a story, if you are honest you are a lot more helpful to yourself and others. Sooner you realise that, the sooner you can make it actionable.If 50 people are saying the same negative thing about your landing page, wouldnt you rather know about it?! Then those people (+ others via Twitter) can see you actioned this and turned it around. Hooray!The Twitter API allows you to extract the data, distinguish what is positive and what is negative (through sentiment analysis) and filter this. We are going to use this to provide an insights dashboard for our users. You can see when you released X version of your product, this many people liked it, this many people didn’t.

The most scarce resource you have at a startup is The problem with both is quite simple — it’s damn hard. It’s hard to remain focused when there are so many inviting opportunities around and it’s too damn painful to be persistent when things get rough and challenging (and they do, more often than not).Tech blogs headlines celebrate “overnight successes” (sans the years of hard work and persistence that were required to get there), emphasize anomalies when they happen, and talk about all those opportunities out there you must consider.Running a startup? my advice to you is this — limit your readings and focus on what you can do right now to push your company and product forward.Tools lover.

As a child, I read Dr. Seuss’ I got a taste of this back in the mid-2000s, working as a freelance interaction designer. Clients initially hired me to do their UX, but the role expanded once I got in the door. Often, they needed help with visual design, so I picked that up along the way. Sometimes, their knowledge of HTML/CSS was limited, so I wrote their front-end (or even back-end) code. At times, I found myself digging into product strategy, or even brand.That diversification was fun, and worthwhile too: today, people seem to value me not merely for my UX  Product expertise but also for my multifaceted background. It’s especially valuable in leadership situations, where hands-on knowledge of the constraints affecting multiple team members can help resolve disagreements.But those disagreements underlie a real challenge. Your designer is As I moved into management roles, I found they worked similarly. You have project-centric goals, team-centric goals, and employee-centric goals. You want to release the best product possible, to make your team as efficient as possible, and also to coach each of your employees to be their best, happiest professional selves. On a good day, you can further all these goals in concert; but often, you have to prioritize. The very thing that makes management so rewarding also makes it hard: your choices, good or bad, directly affect the lives of people you see every day.Founding It’s tempting, faced with such a bewildering array of hats, to respond by working harder, putting in more hours. That’s a mistake. To begin with, it’s bad for your health. There’s an common, damaging notion out there that to run a startup properly you should be working 24/7 — it almost certainly contributes to the Interestingly, the startup stereotype also includes crazy office parties, jam sessions, and ping-pong, all of which are ways of blowing off steam and setting work aside. Founders in their thirties have built more ties outside the office, so it’s natural that dinner with friends or time with the kids might replace ping-pong tournaments. But any way you slice it, down time and sleep are critical to productivity.And some of the most critical hats — the ones that deal in long-term business and product strategy, the ones equipped to answer questions like, “Are we still on the right path?” or, “Did I spend my day on the right things?” —don’t fit when we’re tired, or cranking on a tough coding problem. These are the hats we wear when we step away from our desks, when we talk about the business over coffee or a beer, when we step out for a walk.Sounds easy and delightful, right? Hah. We don’t start companies because we’re looking for a way to kick back and relax. We expect to work hard, and we dive in because we’re driven. Stepping away from your desk is As we’ve built I continue to learn, and to make mistakes, and then to learn some more. And if there’s one thing worth remembering under all these hats, it’s that it’s both expected and OK to make mistakes. If you’re like me, you accepted that a long time ago when it comes to traditional work product (mockups, code, whatever), but it’s harder to remember with respect to people-based work (yourself or your team). Make those mistakes. Learn from them. It’s OK. And don’t forget, from time to time, to take off Product designer, beer  food lover, skier in San Francisco. PM at Google.

All startups know the importance of brand recognition — getting your name out there on social media, to reporters, and to your target audience. Personal branding, however, is sometimes overlooked when it comes to a marketing strategy for many reasons — it’s not easy, it can be uncomfortable, or maybe no one on the team wants to be the face of the company. And I completely understand that.I’m from Argentina, but my company is global, which means I have to get up in front of investors, media, and the general public, speaking in my non-native language. I have to go to events, network, make speeches and converse all in my second language. Now, luckily enough, I’ve had a lot of practice in English, but these tasks are still pretty scary at times. However, my team and I know the importance of personal branding.I was nominated If you Google me (Agu De Marco), you’ll see how my team and I have built up “my brand”. You’ll see my Twitter, Google+, Building your personal brand gives you credibility, which in turn gives your company credibility and authority. It can grow your network and attract new opportunities, and distinguish yourself from your competition. This network doesn’t just build your company, but it also provides support and advice — something every startup needs. Personal branding connects you to your target audience and helps your company grow.While we’re not there yet, just think about some top brands — Facebook, Apple, Yahoo. Most of your next thoughts are Mark, Steve, and Marissa — and that is our lofty goal. Having a person tied to your startup helps brand recognition immensely, which is why it’s important for us. So what I’m saying is that yes, I know it’s hard (and awkward and scary), but personal branding for startups is really important — and I think will become increasingly important as well.CEO  Co-founder at Wideo , Co-founder  Professor of Emprending at University of Buenos AiresThe Story of Latinas and Latinos in Business.

In the startup world, a unicorn is a company that has hit a valuation of epic proportions ( $1 billion) in the short lifecycle of a startup. Unicorns come in many shapes and sizes. They are rare, appear to be made of magic and are hard to duplicate.Boulder, Colorado is a shining example of, and possibly the first place ever identified as, a community unicorn It’s a perfectly balanced, self-sustaining ecosystem that deeply understands how to create a strong community of people which drive entrepreneurship and reproduce intelligence, collaboration and dollars exponentially. It’s as pleasant as it is powerful. It’s a small place that achieves massively big things in proportion.I have spent a fair amount of time in Boulder. Enough for the community to earn my deep respect and carve out a very special place in my heart.I attended I met folks who traveled around the globe, from Rhode Island to Australia, to attend events in Boulder. I sat in on office hours with respected community mentors, gathered with groups of founders in the park, hiked with VCs, and started writing this at a locally loved bookstore cafe.All of my experiences have led me to one conclusion: Cities like Austin have been attracting out-of-towners for big conferences like SXSW for years. But have you attended How do we cultivate a community like Boulder? The simple answer: you don’t. Like a unicorn, every community is unique. Let’s take my hometown, Los Angeles, as an example for comparison.Los Angeles has 100x more people and nearly 200x more space than Boulder*. Those multipliers look awesome if you’re investing in a startup, but when it comes to building community Like any big city, L.A. is made of up pockets of communities, and self-identified areas based on ethnicity or industry that eventually get recognized by the local government (Koreatown, Arts District, Playhouse District). The residents also designate borders with nicknames. We now have “Silicon Beach”, comprised of all the tech companies along the coast from Santa Monica to Venice.We have communities within communities, and are growing quickly to over Last fall, in October 2014, with the help of many awesome members of our community, the inaugural LA Startup Week happened. We had over 2,000 registrations and 35 events — all free and open to the community. Connections were made, conversations happened, and the best part of all: our community came together in a way that felt incredibly genuine.Let’s keep doing this. This fall we will celebrate our community again for a week over October 19–23. We do this to catalyze a stronger, more connected community and put L.A. on the map as a startup communicorn. Participate, volunteer, host an event, open up your office, lead a hike, invite out-of-towners to stay with you for a few days. Do it all in the name of making our community more awesome. Leave your marketing motivations behind. 

Sean Ellis introduced the term “growth hacker” in July 2012. Since then, Google has indexed 32,700,000 pages on the subject and it has become a buzzword in tech marketing startup circles. But that doesn’t stop people from wondering what exactly growth hacking is, and how their companies can benefit from it. A mixture of product development, analytics, and engineering, growth hacking has the ultimate end goal of bringing in users. Regardless of what factors you weave into the marketing mix, if it builds a brand, it is marketing. It is the cheapest way of growing a startup, and you can hit the ground running with a budget of zero and just the internet at your disposal.Growth hackers must navigate the new and constantly changing landscape of marketing and social media. You need your initiatives to be trackable, scalable, and flexible, assets needed in a world where new platforms get created every couple months and if you don’t hop on the right train you will be left behind. You can have the most incredible, potentially transformative product, but it will never even get a single day in the sunshine if nobody else ever finds out about it.Innovative marketing tactics helped drive the growth of DropBox, AirBnB, and Facebook grow into multi-billion dollar companies. Startups should be constantly on the lookout for new opportunities, including new platforms where they can ride on larger companies’ growth. Seek to be one of the first on an underlying network. Opportunities can seemingly pop out of nowhere, and it pays to be an early adopter on a network that is on the rise.In the early days of Pinterest, every user that signed up had to follow suggested Pinterest profiles of early users. Some people who used Pinterest during that initial growth phase were picked up and suggested to a huge audience- growing their followers to millions with no work on their end. It is a rare opportunity to get the chance to ride the coattails of another company’s booming growth, but the payoff is enticing enough that exploring new avenues shouldn’t be ignored.On a larger scale, StumbleUpon reaped the benefits of being one of the first plug-ins on the FireFox browser. Initially, FireFox ranked their plug-ins by downloads and being one of the first add-ons inadvertently gave StumbleUpon preferential treatment. That initial lucky push paved the way and helped StumbleUpon scale from a college apartment project to a web presence with over 15 million users.A product that solves problems is inherently successful, it just needs a chance to gain traction. PayPal piggybacked on eBay by offering them the solution to an issue that they were experiencing on the e-commerce platform. eBay initially ran their business on personal checks, and PayPal offered a superior payment method, both in security and convenience. Credit card companies were still developing a process to manage online fraud, while PayPal addressed the obstacle head on and took the risk upon itself.Although PayPal’s referral program is a legendary growth hack that catapulting their user base to over 100 million members, at a cost of $20 per member. A bold and purposeful move, they experienced 7 to 10% daily growth by giving away $10 to each refering user and $10 to each new user. Startups can utilized this strategy by giving their users an incentive to recommend, vouch for, and spread the word for them. You should test and modify what works the best for your audience, whether that be free shipping, a sign-up bonus, or free credit. The beauty of selling a software product is that it can scale really well, and giving out a free month subscription doesn’t have to cost a company anything yet can be enough to motivate referrals. PayPal users were able to send money to someone without an account, forcing them to open an account to claim their money, further contributing to PayPal’s virality.From data collection to e-commerce, forms are crucial for so many companies. Re-creating forms on another platform would be a logistical nightmare and a time-sink for many businesses, so JotForm not only created a Another way to drive growth while improving customer experience is to create a powerful closed-loop feedback system. All the data from the interaction of the product or service is captured and back back into the system to improve the overall customer experience. Lyft, an alternative cab company, has an exemplary closed-loop feedback system that works towards improving the experience for both the drivers and the passengers. All data points, from the time that a passenger takes to hop in the car after it arrives, to the rating that they assign to their drivers is computed and analyzed. This strategy of perpetual information flow and product enhancement is a superior alternative to an open-loop system where there is no continuous feedback and thus no direct metrics to assist in improvement, such as hailing a cab.“[The job of a growth hacker is to] try a lot of ideas, ruthlessly optimizing successes and quickly discarding dead ends.” — Paul Rosania, Twitter Product managerIncorporating A/B testing into your growth strategy can be a technique that can reap rewards very quickly, even with small tweaks and changes that seem insignificant at the time. The process includes testing ideas, analyzing which growth drivers to keep and which to cut. The faster this process can be repeated, the more likely it is that your startup will find scalable ways to grow. Testing and changing elements like copy text, layouts, images, and colors on your website or mobile app can give you remarkable results.UpWorthy, a website for intentionally viral content, writes a minimum of 25 headlines per article then runs A/B tests: statistical hypothesis testing with two variants. The goal is to identify changes to web pages that increase or maximize an outcome of interest, which in Upworthy’s case is click-through rates. Through their testing and retesting process, Upworthy has helped maximize their potential for reach. Even the design and user experience of their social media sharing buttons has been A/B tested. They found that if the buttons have a hover effect when your mouse is over them, they could get 395% more shares. It was also discovered that the optimal time after landing on a page that the “like us” icon appeared was with a 16 second delay.Even email marketing and other channels can benefit from A/B testing. Pick a defined outcome that is measurable and most relevant to your goals. This can be the number of sign-ups, number of sales, click through rates, conversions, etc. Test 2 groups of users (randomized or targeted according to your objective) and email them the same message with only 1 tweak at a time. For example, send group A an email with the subject line “Ends Wednesday!” Send Group B the same email with the subject line “Ending soon!” You can track open rates, click through rates, as well as sales (you can assign each email group a different promo code or unique tracking link). Take advantage of free tools, like Facebook and Google Analytics to help you determine what people are interacting with the most.Use A/B and multivariate testing (in which myriad A/B tests essentially run simultaneously in as many combinations as possible) continuously to adapt and refine your message. It’s now the standard means through which startups and tech companies improve its websites and products. Startups are by nature able to be lean, agile, and fast-moving, and the course can be diverted to a better path even throughout a single day as ideas can be tested in real time with A/B testing. Without being told, a fraction of users are diverted to a slightly different version of a given web page and their behavior compared against the behaviors of users on the default page. If the new version proves superior, it will displace the original; if the new version is inferior, it’s quietly phased out without most users ever seeing it. Google data scientists ran their first A/B test around 2000 to determine the optimum number of results to display on search engine results page, and since then tools have come a long way in helping facilitate A/B testing, such as No discussion of growth hacking can be complete without touching on the popularly recognized examples from the likes of Hotmail and AirBnB. It seems like a distant memory, but in 1996 Hotmail successfully leveraged its free resource of existing customers: all 20,000 of them. They employed the simple strategy of adding a tagline, “Get Your Free Email at Hotmail”, at the end of each existing user’s outgoing mail. It quickly achieved staggering results: skyrocketing to over a million users within the first 6 months. The ubiquitous “Sent from my iPhone” message appears in all of our inboxes, speaking to the fact that companies are still finding value in this strategy.AirBnB implemented a high-level technical solution that let them tap into Craigslist’s massive user base. Craigslist had the right target market for AirBnB: people who were looking for something other than the traditional hotel stay. Without a public API, AirBnB’s engineers built a brilliant bot that allowed users listing their properties on AirBnB to easily cross-post them to Craigslist in one click. The hack of integrating and optimizing your product to a big platform is a window of opportunity only available in the very early stages of growth. The integration between the two sites is no longer, but the limited time was enough for AirBnB to climb their way into tens of millions of users.This is sometimes all that you need to propel your startup for success. With all hands on deck, both carefully tested and scrappy strategies can move the needle for you. Alex Schultz, VP of Growth for Facebook, explains that “if you’re a startup, you shouldn’t have a growth team. The whole company should be the growth team, the CEO should be head of growth.”Life enthusiast / VP of Marketing Dedicated to Startup Strategy
