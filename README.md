# medium_rnn

Just a not well thought parser of the blogs web medium.com.

It parses all the posts that contain a hashtag that you specify, or a list of hashtags, and gets the raw text from it.

Then i was tryin to build a rnn model, that learnt from each hashtag and wrote blog posts, but never really finished it.
